Unfortunately, I found the backing vocals to border on annoying in that they really sound bored while everything else in the song is popping.  Emphasis on funk, but at times with a heavy shift.

{"text": "I am tempted to use a great deal of slang undecipherable to people who aren't fans of the short-lived tv show \"Firefly\", but I'll try not to because you don't need to be a diehard fan to enjoy this CD.  Marc Gunn & the Bedlam Bards give a modern twist to music one could have heard in any pub or inn decades ago and will hear decades from now.  These modern - dare I say futuristic - drinking songs have references in the lyrics that any \"Firefly\" fan will immediately recognize; however, one of the great things about these songs is that non-fans can enjoy them, too.  You don't have to have seen every episode of the tv show & the movie in order to understand and enjoy the songs.  My son - not a fan - enjoys the CD so much that he is getting his own CD soon.  The lyric choruses are easy to learn, and the tunes are catchy (some are traditional and familiar).  Every Browncoat will want this CD, but I heartily recommend it to non-fans as well.  The humor is linked to the show, but it's funny to non-fans too, and can be enjoyed by all.  The song \"Freedom Costs\", especially, can stand on its own and has so much meaning during this time of war.  If you aren't a Browncoat, this CD could inspire you to become one.  If you are already a Browncoat, it's easy to imagine any & all of these songs being sung around the 'Verse.  They're gorram good!\n", "val": 0.016582930460572243}
{"text": "This collection of songs will delight true Browncoats, and will likely leave other listeners puzzled. If you remember the stories from the Firefly `verse, you will chuckle at the little bits of humor in the lyrics. If you're looking for sophistication and polished poetry, go find something else. \"Firefly Drinking Songs\" is a must-buy for fans of Firefly and Serenity. Listen to it with your Browncoat friends on your next road trip to Miranda, or while munching on your Fruity Oaty Bars and deciding which weapons to bring on the heist. Some grenades would be nice right about now. Let's have no undue fussin'.\n", "val": 0.01006891019642353}
{"text": "A great album for any Firefly fan to listen to and enjoy.  It's got great tunes to make any fan of the series want to don a browncoat and a kilt at the same time.  A couple of personal favorites of mine were \"Kaylee\", \"A Drop of Reaver Blood\", and \"Hero of Canton\".  Once more, it's proof that you can't stop the signal no matter the form it takes.\n", "val": 0.021851465106010437}
{"text": "Marc Gunn and the Bedlam bards have captured  the heart of the Browncoat movement. Those who love the show will laugh at the references made in the wonderful lyrics, and leaving those who haven't seen the show want to learn more about Firefly. From the first to the last some it is a reminder of what made the show great. In that same essence, from the first to the last song The Bedlam Bards and Marc Guinn deliver such a great CD that you can't help but tap your foot, clap your hands and sing along.The from the moment you put the first song \"Monahan's Mudders Milk\" on you realize it's a recorded in from of a live audience CD. You have Marc teaching you the chorus lyrics, and you can't help but to learn them and sing with the group. Next thing you know you are clapping with the live audience with visions from the episode the song references too playing in your hear.\"Somnambulant\" is an introduction to \"Hush, Now Little Citizen,\" Giving you Somnambulant definition and where it was used in the show.\"Hush, Now Little Citizen\" is a song that when you listen to it carefully you realize how it relates to the world around us. How some people would rather us Somnambulant to what's going on in the world. You can come to your own conclusions after you hear it\"Bring me home boys\" is the first of a few songs that you know its about the Battle of Serenity Valley. But its relation to the Wars we are in and have been in the past is amazing. You can almost hear the chorus as someone's last words \"Bring me home boys...tell my mama I am a man\" powerful powerful.\"Kaylee\", is a 50's style love song for our favorite ships tech. This is another one of those songs that Cedric teaches you the part you are going to end up singing along with. The twist in the middle is the first of a few times that made Dr Pepper come out of my nose, so it is well worth the listen from start to finish.\"O Susanna\" is a take on the take traditional song, but with a Firefly rewrite. This song demonstrates the musical skills of all the fine artists on the stage, with a dose of Reever's, fighting, and of course a bit of dreaming about the one you love, and finding them no matter the cost.\"Fruity Oaty Bars\" by far is my favorite song on the CD. From the get go you know where it is from and the images of the very strange tv advertisement that called Summer out, putting the entire plot of the movie into play. With the lyrics continuation the battle of Summer with the bar patrons to Simons Russian to know her out, I giggled like a school girl the entire song.1 2 1 2 5 7  - \"Browncoats Keep Flying\" is a theme song for the Browncoats Revolution.  It says that even tho they got us once, we will get the `Verse back, no matter the cost, but we will get it back. We do what we have to make it, even if its not the most up n up operations, as long as we keep the ship in the air, that's all that matters. A theme, an anthem, a battle cry, hopefully it will unify Browncoats everywhere.\"It's good to have Jayne on Your side\" is about our loveable but dumb hired muscle man Jayne. From Vera the gun to our favorite fluffy handmade hat from his mama he loves; it reminds us why him on your side is the better thenany other side he could be on. It's a song reminder of everything he is and what makes him great. Behind \"Fruity Oaty Bars\" and \"Monahan's Mudders Milk\" this is my third favorite song on the album.\"A Drop of Reever's Blood\" is a rewrite of the traditional tune by the name of \"A Drop of Nelson's Blood.\"  This is a funny rendition of a beloved song, giving it a wonderful Firefly twist, that like many other songs on this CD you can't help but sing a long with. I will admit the ending is another moment where Dr Pepper came out of my nose.\"Whiskey in the Jar\" is another well known Celtic song and show cases that The Bedlam Bards and Marc Gunn are more then parody singers of their original songs, but they haven't left behind the traditional roots that they are known for.\"Liberta Sumptus\" is an introduction for \"Freedom Costs;\" It is Cedric retelling a story from DragonCon, I won't spoil the story but I will say the end he dedicates the next song to all those in the military, past and present.\"Freedom Costs\" is the 2ed military song on the album, but it is the one that hits home the hardest to me. I have friends and family in the military who have come back, and some who haven't. To realize that freedom does cost something, and even though it is related to the Battle of Serenity Valley, if you think of it for any battle, past and present it is an anthem for it. This is a heart melting song that had me singing along and near tears by the end from its powerful meaning.You can't have a Firefly themed cd without \"Hero of Canton\" the now infamous song about Jayne from the episode \"Jaynestown\" where Jayne discovers he has not only a statue but a folk song about him. Everyone knows this song and can sing it in their sleep. The cd ends on this great song that leaves you with a great smile, it completes  the cd by hearing \"Hero of Canton\"So there you have it, 14 songs about the show we love. Our space cowboy theme show about Reevers, Crazy Girls, the `Verse,  flying ships and the Allience. I hope you enjoy the cd as much if not more then I have hearing it and reviewing it. Now excuse me, I need to watch all 14 episodes and the movie. Remember, We Aim to Misbehave, shiny.\n", "val": 0.020086295902729034}

Then comes some pensive church organ as the singer tells the listener he might make some mistakes but he's got your back. And then it gets louder with driving guitars and some nicley harmonized background vocals. Nice teaser to make me wonder about the rest of the cd.I must admit when I heard the ohhhhh ohhhhh's that it made me want to compare them to every performer from the Beatles to Katy Perry but I restrained myself and managed to focus on this particular song.

Just please (please)/Don't lose your faith in me\") so obviously invite comparison to Sting's vastly superior \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You.\"  It wouldn't surprise me to learn that Taking Back Sunday actually meant \"Faith\" as an answer song, though if they did, they don't seem to have said anything about it that I could find.  Whatever their intent, \"Faith\" emerges onto the music scene in the shadow of one of the best solo recordings by a truly amazing songwriter.In spite of, or more likely owing to, their derivative nature, the lyrics are the best part of this song.  The musical setting consists of some pretty intense guitar slamming that comes out louder and more prominent than the vocals for much of the song.  The vocals aren't anything special either; the singing often gives way to arguably tuneful shouting at times of greater intensity.It's not a bad song, and it's worth a listen, especially if you like your music with a hard-rock edge.

{"text": "Driving the road to Hana is a definite must and having a guide is certainly helpful. 12 years ago I drove the road to Hana and had a CD guide which made the drive much more enjoyable. We went on vacation to Maui in June 2016 and I thought we would all do the road to Hana again and of course we needed to use a CD guide. We looked all over for one and finally it was at the ABC store where we found this CD. It cost twice as much as the last one I had but was the only one we could get. Unfortunately this CD was not even close to as good as the last one. It was difficult to follow, there were a lot of missed sights and worst of all the narration was probably the cheesiest most eye rolling thing I have ever heard in my life. The narrator is some hippy-go-free-free wackadoo that wants you to \"pull over...find a comfortable rock and sit...immerse yourself in the surroundings...maybe you'll hear a bird fart, which is a sign of good luck in some cultures.\"  The bird fart part is obviously exaggerated but that was the only part.My in laws went to Maui last year and they said that they purchased a road to Hana guide from a Chevron gas station for less than this sorry excuse for a guide cost and it even came with a DVD of the road you can watch on your own time.This CD is horrible. I hope you read this review so that you know there are better CDs out there for the price you pay.I know that this is one of a few 2 star reviews...most reviews are positive. In the end, this CD will get you to Hana...it will educate you...but there are much better CDs out there.

I do suggest supplementing with a guidebook (check your library after looking at Amazon ratings if you don't want to buy one), especially for some history.

{"text": "There is an Iron Maiden video (circa 1985) called \"Behind the Iron Curtain\" in which a seemingly drunken Bruce Dickinson tells a fan: \"you can't play heavy metal on a synthesizer.\" Well, Bruce was  wrong. He and his bandmates proved this with 1986's Somewhere In Time.  Oddly, while Dickinson himself is not credited with authorship of a single  song on the album, it is perhaps his finest vocal effort. The true genius  of the album, however, lies in the guitar playing of Adrian Smith. He  shines, on every track, but Alexander the Great deserves special mention.  In a single minute of guitar playing, Smith outflashes Van Halen or Vai,  AND plays with more soul than Clapton or Beck at their best moments. That  he had anything at all left in him for Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (my  vote as THE greatest album recorded anywhere, anytime, by anyone, ever) 2  years later is a minor miracle. That he surpases his SIT performance on the  album, well that's just spooky!\n", "val": 0.014072461053729057}

It still stands up today in terms of heaviness.  If you want heaviness, it's there.  But that's not the only reason you'd listen to Somewhere In Time or any 80's Iron Maiden album for that matter.  It's something that intelligent people would make using common sense.Iron Maiden makes things more exciting by adding synths, the addition of which affects the texture of the music.  The songs change lots of pace and tempo.  Somewhere In Time is a must have for any metalhead.  The guitar solos on every song are done very tastefully.  The production is clean and clear.  The album cover is one of my favourite album covers of all time.  Don't judge a book by its cover?  Sometimes DO judge a book by its cover.

Synthesizers gives a cosmic and transcendental touch to the entire album. It is a great combination of real metal and synthesizer. It has a great atmosphere and has a nice balance of complex and simple. Sea of Madness is probably the fastest on here, the main riff is excellent and who can resist the 'OHHHHHHohohOHHHHH.Steve Harris's bass is great as always, and Nicko actually does fantastically in sections on the drums.

I took it over to my cover from the 80's and put them side by side to see how they looked. The rerelease is way washed out compared to the original. The muscle structure on Eddie is a soft pink instead of a darker red and the detail lines are soft. The only part that looks better is aroundthe moon. The rest looks faded by 30-50% (I am not a graphic artist complaining about a 5% difference, this is pretty major)I no that sometimes there can be master issues but the difference in quality is way more than I would expect it to be even if they had to scan and remake an original (which I doubt since Steve is so on making sure Maiden property is protected).So love the songs, but if you want to get the 2014 rerelease vinyl thinking this epic cover would be as stunning as the original than you are in fore disappointment.Since I bought this to display in my office I am sad to see the quality failed, hence 1 star on something that should have been easy to accomplish.\n", "val": 4.762538446811959e-05}

{"text": "Honestly, I should have done this review a while ago, but then again, considering the fact that I now have over 800 CDs worth of music (and counting), combined with how busy I am between work, home life and friends, I have had time for only so many reviews - that is, relatively. Anyways, having been a fan of heavy metal music, both great classic metal like this from the `80s and modern underground metal of today, I think I should have owned this album much sooner. I received my first ever true metal album, Metallica's Kill `Em All, when I was about 15 years old, and was completely blown away. Given that, I find it almost stupid that I did not own this album by the mighty and legendary Iron Maiden until I was 24!Although this album has been criticized for its use of guitar synthesizers on some of the songs, I really do not have any issue with it whatsoever. I find every song on this album to be mind-blowingly epic in every sense of the word on every imaginable level. With almost every song exceeding five minutes in length, it demonstrates the sheer passion, emotion, complexity and technicality for which true classic metal such as this is known. After all, there is a reason Iron Maiden are considered one of the most important contributors to the development of what some people call \"metal as we know it\" and I could not agree more. Bruce Dickinson's high-flying voice, Adrian Smith's mighty guitar solos, Nicko McBrian's insane drumming, plus so much more... honestly, what more can any Maiden fan want?My personal favorites on this album (even though I do love every song on the album from beginning to end):\"Caught Somewhere In Time\"\"Wasted Years\"\"Heaven Can Wait\"\"Alexander the Great\"This album, for obvious reasons, is one of my all-time favorite metal albums from the `80s, hands down. It has turned out to be one of my favorite albums to work out to at my local gym, especially whenever I go for extended runs on the elliptical machines or treadmills; is really helps one to get their legs moving and ticking that calorie counter up higher and higher! Honestly, and needless to say, it is the definition of classic `80s metal, no questions asked.What I also want to point out is that if not for Iron Maiden, NONE of the following bands would exist:Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Overkill, Annihilator, Testament, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, Helloween, Stratovarius, Firewind, Hammerfall, Kamelot, Primal Fear, Rhapsody of Fire, Sonata Arctica, Theocracy, Thunderstone, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Mindwarp Chamber, Royal Hunt, Seventh Wonder, Voyager, Nightwish, Xandria... honestly, there are WAY too many to list!Overall, if you consider yourself a true metalhead, then it makes absolutely NO SENSE for you not to own this album. It has what every metalhead could ask for. Most importantly, as I have said this on a number of my other reviews on a variety of other musicians/bands/artists, epic music like this never gets old. NEVER. It is not old, it is timeless. Anyone who thinks otherwise, and who would say things like \"Get with the times!\" really could use a good psychological examination. Do not ever listen to troll reviewers like Jonas Brothers #1 Fan or Cincinnati Bengals Lover. They are a waste of time and space, and clearly do not know anything about anything. Iron Maiden easily crush the living daylights out of Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy, or anyone else those trolls say is good.ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY IRON MAIDEN!!! FOR NOW AND FOR ALL OF ENTERNITY!!! UP THE IRONS!!! \\M/\\M/\n", "val": 0.003372220089659095}

It has a great sound and you can listen to it over and over. Very sweet rich sound.I've been an Iron Maiden fan since 1988 and this is my favorite Maiden album by far.The album has the theme of \"Time\" or \"Timelessness\".Some of my favorite songs are:\"Wasted Years\" is one the best and most thoughtful songs they've ever written, sounds awesome even today after nearly 30 years. It's personal, touching, pensive and inspiring. Great lyrics and GREAT guitar playing culminate in a superb song.\"Alexander the Great\" is their most epic song. Telling the tale of the greatest military general and leader of all time, the song completely takes you back a few thousand years and walks you through the life of Alexander of Macedonia.\"Heaven Can Wait\" is a song that has all of Maiden's signature elements including an epic crowd chant section.Seriously, this is their best record in my opinion, it just owns.

{"text": "I bought this album when it came out and was pretty blown away at the album art. I did notice it was their first attempt at putting synthesizers in their music. It wasn't bad. Maybe a little akward, but want bad. The music and the lyrics totally make up for it. I can honestly say over the years, the more I listen to this album, the more relevant it becomes in my picks of best Maiden records. The opening song is wasting no time. Caught Somewhere In Time is pretty long and very epic. Wasted Years obviously was the hit on here. Good for them getting one in. BUT my fav song on the album comes next. Sea Of Madness is such a cool apocolyptic song. Birds flying high in the sky and if we were able to see what they song, we sould be sad under the sea of madness. Pretty amazing. Heaven Cant Wait is clever Iron Maiden trickery . Lonelyness Of The Long Distant Runner is my least fav song on here. Lyrics are about a guy running. Anyways! Stranger In A Strangeland is the 2nd pic for me. Again, super cool lyrics and apocolyptic vibe. Deja Vu and Alexander The Great are awesome too. So, maybe not the punishing POWERSLAVE, but a good record. I find myself pulling this one out, and each time, it gives me chills. BTW, you cant beat all the Blade Runner refferences. Such a cool theme! Up the Irons!!! \\m/\n", "val": 0.009719906374812126}
{"text": "This is my favorite Iron Maiden album. If you asked me at the time I might have said 'Powerslave' was my favorite, or even 'The Number of the Beast', not sure. I liked Somewhere in Time when it came out but it took years and years before I began to realize, 'hey, this is my favorite Maiden album'. This is also the last Iron Maiden album I listened to over and over, I had nothing else to do. The three after this, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, Fear of the Dark and No Prayer for the Dying, I'm pretty familiar with but most of their work after this time, with Blaze Bailey singing and then with Bruce again, I've heard it, but it's not as it it's 'part of my life'.Some of the music on the album is overly fast. This is nothing new for Iron Maiden. I remember a friend from school sort of parodying the band by stopping his air guitar, 'doing some drugs', and then continuing on with his Iron Maiden air guitar. Another Amazon reviewer claims that Iron Maiden have a kind of 'galloping sound' to their music. He claimed the Judas Priest song 'Exciter' has this going on the back ground also. The most in-your-face example of what he may be referring to may be the song Metal Church by the band of the same name.On one of their previous albums, probably Piece of Mind or Powerslave, on the back cover of the album it makes note, 'No synthesizers or ulterior motives'. Can only a true man pluck the strings of a guitar - anyone can play the piano, or easier still, the synthesizer? This album features 'guitar synthesizers'. I know Judas Priest used 'guitar synthesizers' on their 1986? album Turbo. Since I like this album so much, is there something wrong or limited with guitars? Whatever it is they do differently on this album they do even more of it on their follow up 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'. So if you like this one. . .Worth delving into. There might even be a song or two you'd want to add to your ipod.\n", "val": 6.746060535078868e-05}

I don't know why Iron Maiden decided to release their albums on picture disc since Brave New World they don't sound as good as normal black or colored vinyl.

{"text": "Seriously what can I say, Iron Maiden are simply one of my favorite metal bands ever. I've even had the pleasure of seeing them live down in Cadott at Rock Fest on their Maiden England North American Tour in July of last year, and they were just flat out amazing live, I felt my breath was literally taken away. These guys have always brought so much to their table other than just catchy, killer rock/metal anthems, they've brought sheer epicness, brilliantly complexed musicianship, and masterful songwriting and lyrics dealing with History, Literature, Mythology, War, Space, and Fantasy, and \"Somewhere in Time\" proves all of that. This album is truly one of Iron Maiden's best releases, it is simply a true juggernaut of a classic album in all seriousness. \"Somewhere in Time\" also introduces the use of guitar synthesizers as well, giving the album a strong progressive feel and atmosphere especially in the opening title track and \"Heaven Can Wait\", and among other tracks on here. Everything that all fans of Maiden cherish and love is definitely all on here. Bruce Dickinson's vocals as always soar so high and mighty, and dueling guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray both dazzle and delight with their incredible riffs and solos. Bassist Steve Harris as usual shines throughout with his incredible bass lines that are almost strong enough to crush your ribcage, and drummer Nicko McBrain shows his awesome talents behind the kit as always. Every song on here is a masterpiece, so there's really no skipping required here.The opening track \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" is an excellent fast 7 minute piece of pure Maiden Madness. The intro is just infectious and pure bliss. The second track \"Wasted Years\" is another one of Maiden's best known songs. This song is filled with more great riffs throughout including a killer opening riff, and the chorus is also very memorable, plus the solo section is just pure bliss as well. Track three \"Sea of Madness\" is no doubt the heaviest song on the album which is highlighted by dominating guitars, hard pounding drums and bass lines, and soaring vocals from Bruce especially in the chorus, while \"Heaven Can Wait\" is an excellent, catchy sing along number with a great bass intro, along with more amazing vocals and guitar work, and of course a catchy middle choral section that you just can't resist singing along to. Next, we have \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" which is another awesome fast galloper featuring fast hammering drum beats from Nicko. \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" is probably the album's best song in my opinion. The guitar solo always sends chills down my spine every time I hear it, just listen to it for yourself. \"Deja Vu\" is a great melodic, yet fast paced number, and of course \"Alexander the Great\" is an amazingly masterful 8 minute epic closer that will take your breath away. As I mentioned earlier, each song on here is a masterpiece, there is not one single bad song on here whatsoever.Overall, \"Somewhere in Time\" is another classic juggernaut of pure Maiden Madness from beginning to end. If you're already a fan of Iron Maiden, then by all means this masterpiece is definitely for you...UP THE IRONS!!!\n", "val": 0.05810152366757393}

{"text": "No heavy metal band was as consistently great in the 1980's as Iron Maiden and Somewhere in Time is another strong album from the British band. This was released in 1986 when some of the traditional heavy metal bands (most notably Judas Priest) started experimenting with keyboards or guitar synthesizers. While this style didn't work for Priest (who overdid the guitar synthesizers to the point of making them sound like a pop band), it worked for Iron Maiden because they used this sound more for color rather than making it their foundation. \"Wasted Years\" would be the first single/video and is one of their best as it has a memorable guitar line and dare I say, a very catchy chorus. The mid-tempo \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" was nearly as good and has become one of their best deep cuts. \"Caught Somewhere In Time\" was another in a long line of musically challenging opening cuts performed at a frenetic pace (the band's opening tracks were the best of the genre, bar none). The highlights continue throughout the album as \"Sea of Madness\" is a riveting track that slows down briefly before coming back harder while \"Heaven Can Wait\" starts out quite somber with Steve Harris's bass synth line before becoming a classic metal track that changes tempos throughout yet it all fits. Other highlights include the killer epic \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" and the wicked unison guitar lines that carry \"Dj Vu\". The last track, \"Alexander the Great\", while musically ambitious, doesn't touch the rest of the album.  All told, Somewhere in Time is another strong album from a band that had a ton of them.\n", "val": 0.017700379714369774}
{"text": "While not my favorite Maiden album, I believe that there were no bad albums released by Maiden during this time period.  The optimal line up of Dickinson/Murray/Smith/Harris/McBrain put out one great album after another until Adrian Smith and then Bruce Dickinson left the band. This album has some great songs.  Aside from the more popular \"Wasted Years\" and crowd favorite, \"Heaven can Wait,\" I personally like the more obscure songs on the album, including, \"Deja vu,\" and \"Alexander the Great.\"  As a side note the artwork is some of my favorite.I love the riffs and guitar work and the composition overall.  The singing is good (I am a huge Bruce fan, so I am biased).  The only reason I don't rate this album a 5 is that they were tinkering a little with their sound.  It was the mid-Eighties and they added in some extra Bass Synth and Chorus effect to the guitars.  Otherwise...Solid.  Maiden.\n", "val": 0.06244965270161629}

I was thirteen, in the mids 80s, riding my bike, when \"Somewhere in Time\" first beamed into my head through the earphones of a Sony walkman. I was hooked.What other band gave you history lessons wrapped in a power metal ballad? You could study for class with \"Alexander the Great\" and other similar historical-based songs on their other albums. I also loved how long many of their songs were and the way the song would totally change the pace or feel halfway through or segue into an extended solo before coming back to the end. I like all the songs on the album, but I had a special fondness for \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea of Madness\", \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", and \"Alexander the Great\".Pure heavy metal from the classic metal era.

At that time I never heard anything from Iron Maiden, or any metal for that matter growing up in a household that did not allow it.  As I gazed at that album cover for the first time I was instantly a Maiden fan. It's a day I'll never forget.  The music and lyrics of Somewhere In Time equally matched the depth and complexity of the cover art which originally drew me in.From there I discovered The Number of the Beast.  Probably the best metal album of all time.  Powerslave and Piece of Mind were also great albums. That block of 4 albums were my personal favorites for years.  I had a difficult time with Killers and their debut album, not because of the songs but because they lacked Bruce.  After listening to Bruce-based albums for so long it was tough to like anything without him.  Although I'd take Di'Anno over Bayley any day!Just recently I re-visited Seventh Son which I didn't care for originally nor listened to hardly at all.  It is now my most played Maiden album, it's like a continuation of Somewhere in Time but absolutely perfect!  The Clairvoyant is in my top 3 Maiden songs of all time with The Evil that Men Do not far behind. I'd like to see Maiden bring the sounds of S.I.T. and Seventh Son and make another synthesized enhanced album (a trilogy).Somewhere in Time is one of the great Maiden albums that is a Must-Have for any fan.\n", "val": 0.049890756607055664}

{"text": "Somewhere in Time (1986) is one of Iron Maiden's finest albums, despite a more commercial sound. Released after the exhausting World Slavery Tour that had something like 200 dates, it represents a shift to some synthesizer work by Steve Harris that was on par for the time (1986). While this new featured sound doesn't really get in the way of great heavy metal, it's still prevalent throughout the album. The songs have a tad bit more melody to them, and aren't as hard-edged or in-your-face as the previous 2 efforts. My favorite song is STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. WASTED YEARS is a very popular Maiden track, as is HEAVEN CAN WAIT, and to a lesser extent, ALEXANDER THE GREAT. SEA OF MADNESS is solid as well.

{"text": "There are many great reviews for this record (Disc), but I never saw this as a good Maiden release, even all these years later. The Introduction of Synths aside, most of this is forgettable and standard Maiden. Hardly their shining moment. A bit uninspired lyrically and scattered musically. There is more melody on this, just not much real fire. A major bit of a letdown after such greats as 'Number', 'Piece of Mind' and 'Powerslave'.Good tracks are - 'Wasted Years', 'Sea of Madness', 'Heaven Can Wait' and 'Stranger in a Strange Land'.'Alexander the Great' is a really good piece that has many time changes, cool offbeats and excellent, melodic Guitar parts in its 8 minutes. Better than I remembered it from years ago. That is a major plus and why I am glad I went back to this disc. Actually brought my 2.5 rating to a 3. Good, Progressive Maiden.But, other than these notes, there are no GREAT tracks at all. Its highly polished and the keyboards/synths just sound dumb and forced in the choruses. Trying to add more melody for a more radio-friendly Maiden at that time. I was never a big fan of this and still am not to this day, but won't say it totally blows. It was a major letdown after their other releases, we will leave it at that.I see many disagree in terms of opinion, so maybe its just me.

Tens of thousands of notes are shreded on this 51 minute plus c.d. Plus Nicko McBrain plays the drums with a fury making the music all the better.

Maiden has never played the latter live, but the all-female cover band \"The Iron Maidens\" play it regularly and do a great job with it (you can see it on YouTube).

{"text": "`Somewhere in Time' was for many fans a step down from the lofty rise to glory that was Iron Maiden's ascendance to the top of the metal heap in the mid-Eighties.  After the marathon world tour of 1984-1985, the band returned to the studio with one major problem. One of their chief songwriters, Bruce Dickinson, seemed to be suffering a case of writer's block. It could have been a case of mental exhaustion or a need to take a step to recultivate his creative juices but for whatever the reason, Dickinson was noticeably absent in the creative process. Adrian Smith continued his writing prowess and it was he and band leader Steve Harris that contributed the songs. \"Wasted Years\", the LP's first single and possibly the best song written by Adrian features his stunning lead guitar as the main melody line and was nearly a crossover single into more the mainstream album rock stations that had previously ignored the band. The song's live for today message struck a chord and \"Wasted Years\" remains the most memorable selection on an album that really didn't have as many as previous classics. \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", another Adrian song and \"Heaven Can Wait\" round out a best of from `Time' which included the usual epic tracks but this time with the exception of \"Heaven\" and maybe \"Alexander the Great\", nothing noteworthy stands out. The band was now using synths to flush out their sound and to their credit, the metal doesn't seem watered down as a result (unfortunately the same can't be said for Judas Priest....eeeshh!).  \"Somewhere in Time\" was the one Eighties album that I have a hard time putting in the same rarified as anything else from the decade.

{"text": "Maiden's 6th release of the 1980s followed hot on the heels of both the critically and commercially successful \"Powerslave\" and the triumphant \"Live After Death\". The monumental World Slavery Tour had cemented them as the premier metal band in the world at this point. In comparison to its illustrious predecessors, Somewhere in Time arrived to mixed reviews and left certain areas of the rabid fan base somewhat confused upon its release in the Autumn of 1986.There are two main facts you need to know regarding this album: firstly, Maiden incorporated synthesisers in to their sound for the first time in their recording history. This rankled with the hardcore metal heads at the time, leaving many old school fans shocked and confused. With over a couple of decades hindsight, *most* of them have now gotten over this fact, but it's still a debate over whether the synths actually added anything to Maiden's sound. In my personal opinion, the inclusion of synths gives a darker, futuristic palette, fully in keeping with the overall mood of the album. Added to this were complaints from some quarters that producer Martin Birch had taken his eye off the ball for the first time, and the production of the album was not as good as on Maiden's previous releases.The second, and perhaps more important, fact that you need to be armed with, is that this album contains no songs by Bruce Dickinson. What transpired, is that Bruce had pushed for a more acoustic, mellow feeling for the album. Bruce's songs were deemed suitably un-Maiden and were rejected out-hand by Harris, Birch et al. Fortunately, stepping up to the plate was Maiden's axe-slinger Adrian Smith, who weighed in with three compositions of his own. The remainder of the album was penned by the ever reliable Steve Harris, with one co-writing credit for Dave Murray.OK so what about the songs? Well, coming off the back of the World Slavery Tour, Maiden were clearly on top of their game in terms of playing, and this album is probably at least as technically proficient as \"Powerslave\", if not more so. Of the eight songs on offer, the stand outs probably all belong to Adrian Smith. \"Wasted Years\" and \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" were both commercial hits for Maiden, and along with the third Adrian song, \"Sea of Madness\", tend to show a more melodic side to the band. The faithful need not have worried too much about these seemingly chart-bothering interests, as Steve Harris weighed in with some typical Maiden gallops. \"Caught Somewhere in Time\", is often cited as a highlight of the album, blasting off with an ominous synth intro, before taking the listener on an out of control time machine trip with a satanic Doctor Who (I kid you not!). The solos in this song are particular stand outs. Steve also contributed \"Heaven Can Wait\", which seems written with live concerts in mind due to its crowd sing-along section. Indeed, it was a regular in Maiden's live set for over a decade, and still makes the odd appearence these days (memorably on their \"Somewhere Back in Time\" world tour). The response to Steve's other songs were mixed - Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner and Deja-vu are both typical Harris gallopers, which perhaps shows some lack of inspiration or fatigue in the band's writing (remember they had just completed an 18 month world tour!). The denouement, \"Alexander The Great\" pays tribute to one of history's greatest dictators by painstakingly listing everything he did. Ever. In chronological order. Depending on who you speak to this is either Maiden's unsung masterpiece or a failed attempt to recreate the glory of \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". I tend towards the latter, but there's no denying that some of the music is very fine indeed.No review of this album would be complete without mention of the cover art, which is perhaps the most intricate and well realised of all the Maiden artwork, containing hidden references to their past.Indeed, the dark, futuristic artwork perfectly complements the overall sound and content of the album: time, time wasted, lost time ... those ominous booming synths. While this shouldn't be your first port of call as a new Maiden fan, and far from their most essential album, with hindsight, it stands well in the better half of Maiden albums. Would a Bruce Dickinson song or two have helped the album? It's hard to say. I don't think the world was ready for an acoustic Maiden in 1986, and Adrian Smith admirably filled the writing void left by Bruce. Maiden would go on to ever greater commercial success with their next release, and if nothing else, Somewhere in Time can be seen as a stepping stone for the band incorporating more technology in to their sound, for better or for worse.\n", "val": 0.00021766647114418447}

{"text": "While this isn't \"Number of The Beast\" or \"Powerslave\", this is still a solid, better than average release from Iron Maiden.  This was the first album that Maiden would incorporate guitar synths into their music.  The synths add texture to them and make them more acessible.  I'm not going to use the C word (commercial)because the songs are still very progressive and too long to be considered made for radio.  Adrian Smith wrote alot of the material on here (Wasted Years, Stranger in A Strange Land, Sea of Madness) and it's obvious his song writing is more pop oriented incorporating sing along choruses and hooks galore.  Pretty much after listening to this album it's not hard to see why he would do just one more album with Maiden before leaving the band for about a 10 year hiatus to go out on his own.  His songwriting was heading in a different direction from the stereotypical Maiden style.  Nothing wrong with that because I found his songs to be a nice change of pace.  His solo on \"Stranger..\" is easily one of his five best of all time.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I found \"Deja Vu\" and \"Alexander the Great\" a bit subpar.  \"Alexander\" doesn't hold up with Maiden's other epic closing tracks like \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" and \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\" although it is better than \"To Tame A Land\".  Overall this is a solid album that I feel is a slight bit better than \"Seventh Son\" although most people feel that was the album they perfected the guitar synths.\n", "val": 0.03261018171906471}
{"text": "After the physically excrutiating World Slavery Tour, which lasted 11 months and consited of 193 shows, Maiden took sixth month a break to recharge their batteries and in January 1986, got back together to write their first album to feature synths: SOMEWHERE IN TIME. This was the first album NOT to be part of the Golden Years era, and the first of their \"Experimentation\" era.This is Maiden's best 80s album they ever recorded. Best listening  setting would be on a cold winter night, in the house with a fire going on and the lights out. But really, it's great anytime and anywhere.CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME: 10+/10: BEST MAIDEN OPENER EVER. From the moment that the Blade Runner-ish intro to the song blasts out of the speakers, you're in for a very fun ride! The song goes into a gallop that is fast, heavy, and awesome, and contains the 2nd most amazing Guitar solo from Adrian! This song sounds great live too, in fact the Osaka '87 bootleg version sounds fantastic.WASTED YEARS: 9/10: A beautiful song with amazing lyrics. Apparently the band wrote this while on the World Slavery Tour, and you can tell. Bruce's voice is fantastic on this, and the intro is pretty cool.SEA OF MADNESS: 10+/10: Maiden's heaviest track yet, and maybe even the best song on the album! Bruce's voice soars, and the guitar truly makes the song. The vocal haromony is great.HEAVEN CAN WAIT: 8/10: Very catchy and singalong-able track, and the bridge is very popular where fans go onstgage at concerts and sing the oohing part. I wish I was onstage at the show I went to, especially with my favorite band (Maiden, of course)! This sounded fantastic at the show I went to on June 6th!THE LONLINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER: 9/10: The tediousness of the ridiculously long title, but other than that, this song ROCKS!!!!! The gallop is fantastic, Bruce's vocals shine on the album here. And the \"I've got to keep ruuuunning...\" part just blows me away everytime I hear it.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND: 10/10: A catchy song that does a good job at creating a desperate mood. Definitely creates a video in your head too, of a desperate man lost and looking for help.DEJA VU: 4/10: This song isn't that bad, but the song sounds like it was recorded in one take (in other words rushed- Moonchild was recorded in one take but at least it sounded awesome), plus Bruce sounds awful on this song.ALEXANDER THE GREAT: 10/10: A fantastic epic song that creates the \"warrior\" feel. Time signature change is very prominent here, and Bruce and Adrian truly shine, as well as Nicko's drumming is fantastic.Overall, this is Maiden's best 80s album. I got it back in Febuary and have loved it ever since. BRAVE NEW WORLD is my favorite Maiden album, but this one still rocks! Buy it if you don't have it!\n", "val": 0.06055022031068802}
{"text": "Masterpieces are works that outlast their creators; even if those creators are still around. Such significant pieces define the artist, and in the realm of music the examples are so many: The Beatles' 'Revolver', The Rolling Stones' 'Sticky Fingers', Led Zeppelin's fourth album 'Zoso'. Their preceding albums are the buildup to that monumental apex, the peak, of where they are at their best, but most importantly of all where it all just comes together and where minor flaws just don't even exist. Though many will disagree with this humble opinionator, Iron Maiden reached their perfection with 'Somewhere in Time'. Just as Iron Maiden could not get any better after 'Powerslave', they prove all wrong with unforgettable heavy metal classic.As many have said before me, this is Iron Maiden at it's peak; ironic because looking back it was obvious to them because throughout the album there is evidence they don't pass it up. The album as a whole has an energy rooted heavily into metal, but it is so infectious and listenable non-metal/Maiden fans can be drawn in. There are solo interludes, but they're limited but for good reason: sometimes lead guitar solos can kill momentum in a song. In fact, I dare say it's drummer Nicko McBrain's instrument leading the way, bashing away with a combination of John Bonham power and Keith Moon precision. By and large Nicko's best work on any Maiden album.Bruce Dickinson is at his signature best here with challenging ranges, singing the songs penned by Adrian Smith and Steve Harris. All three seemingly had made sure Dickinson's power was not underused and at the same time made certain every word was just as understandable as the last, so vocals and music flowed evenly. The singing misses found on 'Piece of Mind' and 'Powerslave' are nowhere to be found on this album.Though this album does signal a transition of sound in Iron Maiden with the addition of guitar synth you wouldn't know it by listening. It's the perfection of the old sound from 'Piece', from 'Powerslave', from 'Number of the Beast. You hear it -- in my opinion -- in one of the greatest songs of all time, \"Wasted Years\"; a five-plus minute introspective of Iron Maiden's touring life, filled with regret, realization, and reality. That definitive tipping point song; where Zeppelin had 'Kasmir', Maiden's 'Wasted Years' is that exact location where the bridge of Old Maiden and New Maiden meet, shake hands, and share tea.Without 'Wasted Years', the other songs by themselves would own the whole album. Iron Maiden wastes no time, no pun intended, with the intro song 'Caught Somewhere in Time'. A slow build up to start, but once we clear the start the blitz is hard, charging, and in your face. Dickinson is literally five inches in front of you, singing the song. Until the album 'Brave New World', no one would realize that the songs 'Sea of Madness' and 'Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner' were precursors to that future (and brilliant) release. 'Stranger in a Strange Land' and 'Heaven Can Wait' have lead ins and winks to the past to remind us that nothing has been left behind. The last track, 'Alexander the Great', would have been the track, if not for 'Wasted Years', that would have bridge the old sound and new sound of Maiden, where Maiden was not afraid to have a collection of eight minute songs on an album.Even if you are not a heavy metal or Iron Maiden fan, this album represents so much in terms of musical quality and unleashed youth. We would like such purity in every release from our favorite musicians, but the truth is such purity is as unpredictable as a lightening strike, insomuch as if it will strike twice. Some say it does, but all I can say is this: 'Somewhere in Time' stands the test of time with any release, and even for non-Iron Maiden fans it cannot be passed up.\n", "val": 0.019735995680093765}

Yes, you can hear the synthesizers starting to creep into to the music and the creative talent starting to slip.

If only the latter had lyrics dealing with the runner from the Battle of Marathon then I could relate but the lyrics are just terrible!  I like 'Alexander the Great' but I always thought the song would have been better if Dickinson would have been more poetic about it instead of making the song just a history lesson.  In terms of music, one definitely gets the feeling of less innovation in just about every department except the synthesizers and that's pretty sad for a band like Maiden that just hadn't sold themselves out.

However, I think that \"Somewhere in Time\" is, regardless of how influential it is, remains one of the best heavy metal albums of all time. From the larger-than-life opener of \"Caught Somewhere In Time\", we are taken to a futuristic world in the style of Iron Maiden. Where powerful drumwork and amazing guitar and bass melodies compliment ingenious and adventurous lyrics. Take the effects-driven lead guitar riff, wondrous guitar solo and sing-a-long chorus of \"Wasted Years\". Even \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" takes a topic like running and makes it seem so much more bold and majestic. Some people may say that adding this tone to classic Iron Maiden may have been a slight mistake on the band's part. This was ironically released in the same year as Judas Priest's \"Turbo\", which had very similar, futuristic-sounding elements to it. Even though this album is generally remembered as being much better, I happen to like both albums. What you have to remember is to keep an open mind. Don't you think if a band released the same album over and over it would get tiring? Admittedly, \"Alexander The Great\" runs up a bit short in comparison to the absolute epic of Iron Maiden's \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", but that's all right, because the rest of the album is great all the same. Other strong points include \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" which features a great, opening bassline and another catchy chorus. A personal favorite is \"Deja Vu\", which seems to be enormously influential in the power metal genre. The driving energy behind the drums, the spacey wah-wah riffing of the guitars, and Bruce's untouchable wailing of \"Feel like I've been here before!\". And it all ends up being classic Maiden with a new twist to it. So, some people may have mixed feelings about this album. Me? I think it adds an exciting, new element to an already awesome band. This is personally an album I hold in high regards. In my opinion, if you want more great Iron Maiden and have an open mind, this is something I hope you're really gonna love. After all, Maiden's already known for their incredible musicianship and professional songwriting, what's wrong with taking a little trip through time? Speaking of which, thanks for the time, and peace.\n", "val": 0.02540052868425846}
{"text": "Somewhere in Time is not a \"concept\" album like its follow-up, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, but its comes close at times (ha, get it). Anyway, this is an album that originally (upon release) caused some casternation among some longtime fans. In were keyboards (well in this case guitar synths, same difference), and out was the statement in the linear notes of Piece of Mind; \"no synths or ulterior motives\". However, unlike bands such as Judas Priest, etc, their journey through the realm of technology wasn't motivated by some \"streamlining\" of their sound at all, and even if it were, it certainly didn't turn out that way. One of the greatest things about this album was Adrian Smith's maturing as a player and songwriter. Some of his greatest songs (Stranger in a Strange Land) and solos (practically every song) are found on the album.In regards to the music itself, Prog Rock influences permeate much of the album. They're subtle, but they are definitely there (making Iron Maiden a \"precursor\" to prog metal, as controversial as the statement may be). For example, the rhythmic structure of the beginning of Heaven Can Wait is somewhat similar to Genesis's Watcher in the Skies (I wonder if anyone else has noticed the similarity, and being as Steve Harris practically worships at the 70's Genesis altar, I can see how the influence can come into play). Also, Stranger in a Strange Land has some similarity with latter day Pink Floyd, especially come solo time with its solos complete with a wash of delay and reverb (Adrian Smith's MASTERPIECE in my opinion)- it reminds me of the rhythm of Floyd's Young Lust, with much more atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, I don't think there are many 80's metal albums with such a dreamy, futuristic feel as this album. The synths serve the album well and take one to a faraway place. \"Time\" definitely permeates the lyrics, from the title track to Heaven Can Wait, to Wasted Years. \"Deja Vu\" fits the \"time\" concept as well, and Alexander The Great covers History like only Iron Maiden can do. Alexander the Great features, among other things, some great progressive time changes, odd timings, clean guitars with a \"bolero\" style buildup, and some great modal interplay. In other words, I take back any statement that Iron Maiden aren't progressive metal. They helped create the genre with this release and having already conquered the world of metal, they conquered the world of Progressive \"thinking person's\" metal with this album.Songwriting: I have to say this album's songwriting demolishes most of the other albums. Its hard to say which Maidens are my favorite, but this is definitely in the top 3 or 4.My fave album cover of theirs as well.\n", "val": 0.01287222933024168}
{"text": "Iron Maiden's sixth studio album \"Somewhere in Time\" is a heavily discussed album by fans of this legendary English band. It was very original in its day, as the band switched to synth guitars on this album and were among the first band to use that instrument in a way that enhanced their sound. At the same time the synth sounds alienated many fans, of which quite a few would say that this album showed a band in creative and musical decline.Musically the band has perfected their sound on this album. The playing is tighter than the proverbial duck's arse, and the band members are experienced enough to add the extra touches to ordinary tunes to make them sound good, adding small nuances and touches in turn to make the songs sound interesting; as can best be heard on opening track \"Caught Somewhere in Time\".Adding the synth sounds to the music also elevates many tracks from the realm of the ordinary to something better, where the slightly softer edges of the synth guitar riffs adds flavout and atmosphere to Iron Maidens trademark harmonic and melodic soloing and riffing, and giving a warmer touch to Maidens pacey songs, where the fast paced bass guitar and drumming do sound better accompanied by the slightly softer synth guitars.A new aspect to Iron Maiden's sound on this album, or at least an aspect much developed here, are several examples of songs where Bruce Dickinson's vocals are used as a melodic instrument in itself. These songs are rather monotone and repetitive apart from the soloing, and Dickinson's vocals carry as good as all melody in the singing parts of these songs. \"Wasted Years\" is a very good example of this. If this is planned or more an indirect result of the synth guitars slighter fuzzy sound is of course something that only can be speculated upon.The influence from progressive rock continues on this album as well; an aspect of their music surfacing on their previous studio album \"Powerslave\". As with that album, in many songs the progressive elements are more to be found in structure than in actual playing; and the elements are most noticeable in the long, epic tracks on this release.The individual songs on \"Somewhere in Time\" are a rather mixed affair. Although musically at their peak now in my opinion, the songs as such aren't as good as on previous albums. The creative well seems to have run dry; with fewer songs than normal containing original or really captivating elements.The addition of the synth guitars to their sound as well as the band members ability to play on individual and collective strengths are the factors that elevate this album to an interesting, albeit varied, release.Personal favorites: \"Sea of Madness\", \"Deja Vu\", \"Alexander the Great\"\n", "val": 0.009383116848766804}
{"text": "By the time \"Somewhere in Time\" came out in 1986, I was well into Iron Maiden. I owned every album available in the States, had read \"Running Free,\" and took in my very first concert -- 1985's World Slavery Tour. (What a first concert!) Fairly or unfairly, I had high expectations for this next album, feeling that my musical heroes could do no wrong.I had read that the group would be incorporating a guitar-synth on the next album. I also had heard that Bruce Dickinson wanted to take a different direction and do an acoustic album. What really got me interested was that Adrian Smith was going to take a lead role in some of the songwriting. With having a hand writing songs such as \"The Prisoner,\" \"The Flight of Icarus,\" \"22 Arcacia Avenue,\" and \"2 Minutes to Midnight,\" I couldn't wait!I managed to pick up the cassette on the release date, and was again impressed by yet another Derek Riggs masterpiece. I know I missed out on the album art detail with the cassette, but records were well on their way out at this time, and I wanted to listen to this album on the way home. Those that have the album can see all the little jokes on neon signs and in the storefront windows.My first impression? I was under-whelmed. The opener \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" fell somewhat flat -- I just couldn't get into the guitar synths. At that time, some of the other songs seemed like throwaways -- \"Heaven Can Wait,\" \"Deja Vu,\" \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,\" and \"Alexander the Great\" really didn't do much for me. To me, Adrian Smith's songs were by far the strongest on the album. \"Wasted Years\" and especially \"Sea of Madness\" and \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" really showcase some fine songwriting skills.I think the album as a whole was a letdown to me because it seemed somewhat uninspired and lacked direction. It wasn't until years later that I learned there were some creative differences within the band at that time that might have affected the material. I also looked at \"Alexander the Great\" as an attempt to recapture the lyrical magic of Powerslave's \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" Musically, it's interesting, but lyrically, it fell flat. Coleridge's epic poem translated much better to music than Plutrarch's history.But time has a way of putting things in perspective; and looking back at this album, knowing what was going on within the band at this time, and hearing the music again after all those years, I find I enjoy listening to the whole thing. I still think Adrian's songs are the strongest, but I have a new appreciation for those songs I kicked to the curb back in '86. I will even go as far as saying musically they've rarely been in better form on an album.1986/87's Somewhere on Tour concert was spectacular -- probably better than the World Slavery Tour by a hair. Flying spaceships, Bruce's pulsing neon-tube vest, and a robot Eddie...what's there not to like? I found the SIT songs translated very well live -- even with the synth guitars. I remember Adrian and Dave performing a really cool guitar-duet they called \"Walking on Glass.\" A top notch show.For me, this one ranks three and a quarter stars. Almost four, but not quite.\n", "val": 7.147112773964182e-05}

Pretty good instrumentals, as usual, but I really don't care about Alexander the Great, and the lyrics are so-so.  I was listening to IM and Killers back in the early 80's, so it's not like I'm not a Maiden fan (otherwise I wouldn't have spent so much $$ getting my old Maiden's on cds).  And I like a lot of songs since SIT, but mostly just 1-3 songs per cd. Buying a cd for that is just wasteful unless you're a collector.  This one's $14... I should have downloaded Wasted Years (one of my all-time favorites) and saved $13.  It's not fair to only be rated by IM fans that will rate 4-5 stars no matter what, so I must drop it down a notch.

Fans can still recognise the trusted Maiden hallmarks, but with some added flavour to spice things up.This is one of my all time favourite Maiden CD's, especially...well, hell, I like them all, pretty much. It is hard to choose what I like better. \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" makes an excellent kick start to what is a fantastic journey through some lively, thumping and awesome metal.Being into running, I really enjoyed the song \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\". Only Maiden could take something so mundane and make it sound so cool. \"Alexander the Great\" is also a fantastic song, with some great music work and tight vocals.Although a slightly different feel to Iron Maiden's usual, \"Somewhere in Time\" is something every fan should have in their collection.

{"text": "Iron Maiden were the biggest Metal band in the world in 1986. Their reputation had been forged through tireless touring and prolific, high quality, very Metal albums. Having produced five studio albums in five years, and backing them all up with extensive world tours featuring massive live productions must have become tiring. While the band released Metal's greatest double live album `Live After Death' in 1985, no studio album was forthcoming that year. Was there a problem? Was Maiden tiring?When `Somewhere In Time' was finally released in September 1986, shock horror, Iron Maiden had done something different!The cover art offered a clue. Eddie had sprouted wires, a bionic eye and a laser, and was standing as a gunslinger in a Blade Runner/Terminator sci-fi cityscape. While not a concept album, like 1988's `Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son', a future shock/passage of time theme connects much of the album. The biggest change was the addition of synth bass and guitars, much to the consternation of long-time fans of the band. The synth sounds of the guitars and bass added to the cyborg feel, combining both the organic and the mechanical. Steve Harris' bass doesn't have quite the same gallop as on previous albums, but the minor change goes along with the band trying to do something a little different. And just because the guitars sounded a bit different didn't mean Adrian Smith and Dave Murray had forgotten how to play them.While the singles \"Wasted Years\" and \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" were highly successful, neither were instant classics like \"Number Of The Beast\" or \"Run To The Hills\", but as a whole, this album is far more consistent than the previous three. There are no fillers, like \"Back In The Village\" or \"Invaders\". \"Two Minutes To Midnight\", from the `Powerslave' album would have fitted perfectly on to `Somewhere In Time', perhaps even hinting toward the direction of this album.There are some great moments of pure Maiden on this album. Bruce Dickinson's voice is allowed to really soar at times, like on \"Sea Of Madness\" and \"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\". The latter also features a snare/kick drum pattern from Nicko McBrain to simulate the runner's footsteps. \"Wasted Years\" is a song about not wasting opportunities and the brilliant descending scale riff is one of the best the band has ever recorded.\"Alexander The Great\" is one of Iron Maiden's greatest epics. It was also impossible to play live until recent years, because it has so many different guitar lines weaving in and out of each other. The lyrics are a dramatisation of Alexander The Great's conquests, and like great Classical pieces, like \"William Tell Overture\" or \"Hall Of The Mountain King\", the multi-faceted, layered music also tells the story. Despite Bruce Dickinson having a degree in history, \"Alexander The Great\" was written by Steve Harris.Science Fiction influenced Metal albums are a dime a dozen now, but back when Iron Maiden released `Somewhere In Time', it was innovative and more than a little surprising. Despite criticism levelled at the band back then, and in the years since, `Somewhere In Time' has held up well. Even casual Maiden fans need to hear this album.\n", "val": 0.019013039767742157}

{"text": "Somewhere In Time (1986.), Iron Maiden's sixth studio albumIn the first half of the 1980's, Iron Maiden's rise in popularity had been something of legend. From storming into the New Wave of British Heavy Metal scene with their self titled debut album, the band never looked back; even in the face of line up changes that plagued them in their early career. With what is regarded as the `classic' Maiden line up in place, with Bruce Dickenson (vocals), Nicko McBrain (drums) and Adrian Smith (guitar) joining long time members Steve Harris (bass) and Dave Murray (guitar) over the course of a couple of albums, the band went on to record `Piece Of Mind' and `Powerslave'. Both classic albums, the band again showed they were the masters of the dual-guitar heavy metal onslaught with more than a fair share of rip-roaring tunes. The question was, where should the band progress from here? Songs like `Rime Of The Ancient Mariner' had more than hinted at the band's progressive ideas and indeed this was the next territory for the group to delve into. Following a mammoth (and I mean MAMMOTH!) `Powerslave' tour which lasted nearly a year and encompassed nearly 200 concerts, the band went back to the studio to record `Somewhere In Time'. One of their more now underrated albums, it was released perhaps at the height of the band's popularity. So how does this more progressive epic from Iron Maiden fare?`Somewhere In Time' for me is an impressive development on the archetypal Maiden sound. The main change is in the form of introducing subtle synthesisers into some of the band's songs and also longer more progressive song structures overall (the album's shortest track is at 5 minutes). That said though, these changes don't weigh down the Iron Maiden sound in this album. The synthesisers aren't in your face (they are slightly more bloated on the follow-up `Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' and the longer songs never settle into too repetitive riffs. Bruce Dickenson's vocals are an important factor in this as he carries the lyrics with a great deal of urgency which keeps the music flowing along. Sadly though, I feel the more progressive nature of this album is what makes it quite an underrated work by the band - certainly it gained a more mixed reaction from fans when in was released back in '86. For me, the guitar work on the album is of similar heaviness to previous albums and has just as much pace (songs like `Caught Somewhere In Time' fly like the wind!) Also, the album provides a good mix of more catchier numbers mixed in with the more progressive stuff to please the hardcore Maiden fans. Adrian Smith certainly shines most of all in the songwriting department on this album with fantastic songs in `Sea Of Madness', `Wasted Years' and `Stranger In A Strange Land', the latter two of which provided Iron Maiden with a couple of successful hit singles. The cover to the album is an awesome one too, have a look and see just how many references you see to previous songs by the band on it, in it's futuristic setting!Not too long ago, the Iron Maiden catalogue got totally remastered and improved. Hence the 1998 remasters are the way to go. The remaster job is great and all of the songs shine through with no sound glitches but also the recent version features and excellent accompanying booklet. The CD itself also has an enchanced multimedia section and you can view video footage of the 'Wasted Years' and 'Stranger In A Strange Land' songs from your PC.Title track `Caught Somewhere In Time' gets Maiden's sixth album underway. This opener is a classic epic, set up fantastically by an opening haunting riff. This song has a great brisk pace throughout which never looses momentum, helped along by some strong Dickenson vocals. Murray and Smith play out some great solos mid-way through also. The first hit single in `Wasted Years' is next up, the first of 3 great songs written by Adrian Smith on this album. Again the song has an infectious opening riff which develops it's way throughout and a proper sing along chorus which in true Maiden style. `Sea Of Madness' follows, with a much more mellow sound to it. Again, a strong chorus and also a catchy undistorted bridge with more great Dickenson vocals. `Heaven Can Wait' marks the finish to the first half of the album. This is perhaps my favourite song on here. The highlights are the bass intro with clever guitar interjections, the blistering lengthy solos and the somewhat cheesy but effective interlude. Again another song which never falls down in speed and doesn't lose interest.`The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner' is next, another Steve Harris epic based on the 1960's film of the same title. The intro to the song is surprisingly reminiscent to the tune to later song and Maiden fan favourite `Fear Of The Dark', still it sets a gentle, unassuming pace before the song breaks out into full attack with snarling Dickenson vocals in the verse and a thrashing chorus. `Stranger In A Strange Land' is a true classic and another top cut on this album. A formidable, plodding bass line opens up a particularly entrancing song with plenty of diverse guitar work and a surging chorus. The interlude is a great chilled out affair with some fantastic bass/guitar interactions. `Deja-Vu' follows; definitely the weakest track on here IMO. The riffs are surprisingly catchy though however the lyrics are pretty awful with a repetitive `Feels Like I've Been Here Before' repeated chorus. It's a bit of a `Maiden on autopilot' kind of song. Still, the album picks up again with the progressive epic in `Alexander The Great'. This follows on from where `Rime Of...' left off, this time obviously though with synths. Although not as timeless as `Rime...' it's still a great slice of adventurous metal that only Maiden could do well. The lyrics, although delivered brilliantly by Dickenson, do become somewhat of a boring history lesson in parts but never the less it's a captivating epic, full of twists and turns in the melody. There's more great solos (with clever bass fills) and the interlude has riffs with an ancient feel to them, which was not doubt what the band wanted to achieve with this epic.`Somewhere In Time' is another excellent album from Iron Maiden and is yet another successful chapter in their career during the `80's. It's a sadly underrated album that showed yet again that the band was capable of developing and producing a few more surprises. Although I wouldn't rank this alongside Maiden's 5* efforts like `Number Of The Beast' or `Powerslave', it's on the next level down, which is still fantastic and should be an integral part of any Iron Maiden fans collection. Not for a Maiden newbie, pick this one up once you've got into the band's more famous albums like `Number Of The Beast' or `Iron Maiden'.

{"text": "I admit, I may not be the biggest \"Iron Maiden\" fan.  In fact, when it comes to the metal realm of music, I tend to gravitate towards more extreme bands like \"Slayer\", \"Death\", \"Deicide\", \"Napalm Death\", etc.  However, the influence and effect \"...Maiden\" has had on this musical genre cannot be disputed.I've always had an interest in early \"...Maiden\" up until their seventh release, \"Seventh Son Of a Seventh Son\".  Wasn't too crazy about that particular recording or one of the hits from it, \"Can I Play With Madness?\"  I'm not putting it down, it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I never really bothered to follow \"Maiden\" after that.  Yet their previous stuff intrigued me.  After I saw a VH-1 doc. on the metal genre, my interest in \"Maiden\" became renewed.  I reviewed some \"Maiden\" history, and I discovered the early \"Maiden\" recordings have been remastered and re-issued, so I dived in.\"Somewhere In Time\" is an amazing album, everything clicks.  I was surprised to see that Bruce Dickinson received no song/lyric writing credit here, but I expected to see Steve Harris' name quite a bit, and he delivers.  Highlights include \"Caught Somewhere In time\", \"Wasted Years\", \"Stranger In a Strange Land\" and \"Deja Vu\".  Yet \"Heaven Can Wait\" and \"Alexander the Great\" totally blew me away.  Fantastic songs, but I wasn't too crazy about \"Sea Of Madness\" and \"The Loneliness Of the Long Distance Runner.\"\"Iron Maiden\" really carved a niche for themselves in metal history with their unique brand.  I never understood why people consider this cheesy, but I love it when bands write songs about history, literature & movies.  Along with their eye-catching titles and cover art, they satisfy in the lyrical department with great music to match.Well, that's my opinion, like it or lump it.  If you're already a \"Maiden\" fan, my review is pointless.  I'm sure there are many more detailed reviews written by die-hard fans.  However, my review is geared more toward someone with a passing interest in \"Maiden\" who wants to know a bit more about them.  Don't start with this one, work your way up to it.  It's well worth it, and you may discover why these Brits have perservered for as long as they did.\n", "val": 0.008355128578841686}

{"text": "Iron Maiden has been a band that I can listen to more than just one CD over and over and over and over again. Anything from \"Iron Maiden\" to \"Seventh Son\" and \"Brave New World\" and onward. \"Somewhere In Time\" is my personal favorite of them all!\"Somewhere In Time\" marks a shift in Iron Maiden's music from \"Powerslave\" taking their signature metal style full of dual lead guitar, melodic riffs and vocals, and lead style bass play and pounding drums and adding some keyboard (or guitar-synths) to the melodies creating some sort of atmosphere that just fits the album cover perfectly! It sounds so...futuristic as far as production goes. Musically, it's no different from previous Maiden releases. Songs get a bit longer though, showcasing some progressive elements creeping in, I think that shows some maturing in songwriting but that's just my opinion. Real keyboards would be further included in the band's follow up \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\" which is stylistically the same as \"Somewhere In Time\" but not as futuristic, or atmospheric.The album kicks off with what has been added - futuristic dual lead guitar-synths before kicking into full speed in what Iron Maiden has been known for in the song \"Caught Somewhere In Time\" - what else...IT GALLOPS - another signature of Maiden. Bruce's chorus is a great example of why Bruce is the voice of Maiden with his high wails of \"caaaaaaaaught sooooooomewwwwwwhhhhere in taaaayyyiiiayyyyiiaaayyyym!!!\" \"Wasted Years\" has yet another futuristic lead guitar intro, a catchy chorus. \"Sea Of Madness\" and \"Heaven Can Wait\" have a very atmospheric intro before jumping into Full Maiden mode. Most of the songs follow that particular thing. All the songs have something to do with \"time\" and they have this digital, futuristic feel to them that just capture the concept perfectly! \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" just has me imagining an entire time travel especially in the lead guitar during the chorus.I like the typical Iron Maiden formula a lot, but the inclusion of this specific production, atmosphere, spirit and the synths make the album very unique while still sounding somewhat classic.If you're a hardcore Maiden fan, you probably already have this album. If you're starting, I'd like to say start with this album, but you might wanna be familiar with something like \"Number of the Beast\" or \"Powerslave.\"Whatever, I love this album a lot, not only is it my favorite Maiden album, but it's also one of my favorite metal albums of all time!UP THE IRONS!!!\n", "val": 0.00425852183252573}

Many Maiden fans say this is one of their best works and I agree.  What's exciting about this album is that an evolution was starting to happen here.  New sounds were being used.  How many times do you hear a band (esp. a metal band) try something like that and fail miserably?  Maiden showed why they are pioneers and have been able to sustain for decades.  There really is some epic material on here.  Nice technical sound to the music.  Each song flows nicely into each other.  I still get chills when I hear Wasted Years and the chorus to Heaven Can Wait.  This CD was followed by another epic in 7th Son.  This band never ceases to amaze me.\n", "val": 0.08153227716684341}
{"text": "I first listened to maiden in 1990 after thinking maybe I should give some 80's metal (besides metallica) a chance.  I instantly liked the first recording and have to say i prefer Di'Anno's vocals over Dickenson's, but musically i really think \"somewhere in time\" is the best maiden i've heard.  In all fairness though, i think Dickenson did a fantastic job on this disc that might have one-upped anything Di'Anno might have done.  For instance, \"wasted years\" couldn't be done by anybody but dickenson, a killer track.  Dickenson's vocals on \"sea of madness\" also impressed me.Many fans didn't like the addition of the synthesizers into maiden's recordings, but i really think it made maiden harder and have a much fuller sound than their previous outputs.  The opening of the song \"somewhere in time\" is one of my favorite song openers of all time.  This song captures the creativity and spirit of iron maiden, which is kind of like a sci-fi theme, an interesting use of the metal genre.  This album would have gotten five stars from me if the last half of it was as strong as the first, unfortunately i just don't think that \"de ja vu,\" \"loneliness...\" or \"alexander the great\" can compare to the first four tracks or \"stranger in a strange land,\" musically or lyrically.

In my humble opinion, it's about as potent as their previous efforts like 'Number Of The Beast', 'Piece Of Mind' or 'Powerslave'. But these British merchants of metal mayhem seem to have put out SO many releases now, I've sort of lost track. Best thing about 'Somewhere' is they'd decided to now employ a synthesizer in their sound, very wise move. Tracks I remember the most off this CD reissue are the album's single \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea Of Madness\", \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" (love the old MTV video) and \"Heaven Can Wait\".

It's just got a futuristic feel to it. I think that your reviewer Mr. Sinister from a review in late December 2005, said that he thought the song \"The loneliness of the long-distance runner\" was a stupid (he didn't choose those words I think) song, but I thought especially musically it was a very top notched track, and I was a long-distance runner in track and cross-country, so I thought it was cool, but I can kind of understand where Mr. Sinister's coming from anyway. This album kind of sounds poppy instead of straight ahead metal, but it still works in my opinion. Of course \"Wasted Years\" was a good hit for them, but I like \"Sea of Madness\", \"Alexander the Great\", \"Stranger in a Strange land\", and \"Deja-Vu\" quite a bit. I would rank SOMEWHERE IN TIME as their second best to SEVENTH SON and PIECE OF MIND which are tied for no. 1 Now that Adrian Smith is back with them, why do they need a third guitarist? You don't really need three guitars do you? I think for someone who is new to Iron Maiden, this would be the perfect place to start. Then, you might give SEVENTH SON and PIECE OF MIND a whirl.

{"text": "Iron Maiden had just come off one of the most successful tours in Metal history with Powerslave.  The live album Live After Death is one of the greatest efforts ever recorded.  And then comes Somewhere In Time...  Here we have a band that is starting to feel comfortable with each other.  A band that has become successful and famous, a band that is going to start to play with their musical formula to make sure that they don't stagnate.  In come the guitar synths.  In come the larger-than-life tunes with grandiose production values.  In comes the hit single that is \"Wasted Years\" and Iron Maiden continue to grow in popularity, but at what cost?  If there is a line of demarcation where Iron Maiden begin to slip in the eyes of the true metal fans, it would be right after Piece Of Mind.  Powerslave was cool, but there were a few less than awesome tunes buried in the album's midsection.  Now we have Somewhere In Time, and the need to get a little more mainstream has become too great for the Maiden bunch to deny.  Is Somehwere a bad album?  Is it horrible?  Obviously not.  What it isn't is The Number Of The Beast.  It rocks, but on a lesser level.  There is definitely effort and cohesion on this Maiden outing, it's just that the signature sound is starting to wear a little thin in places.  Let's look at the track listing:Caught Somewhere In Time -  A rocking opener.  Filled with power and pulsing metal goodness.  There is energy here in this song that gives us hope for the following tracks.Wasted Years - Great song.  Probably one of Maiden's more commercially successful tunes.  A personal favorite.  Reflective lyrics.  Great vibe.Sea Of Madness - This song opens with a great barrage of slamming drums and wailing riffs.  Steve Harris is speaking with his bass and we hear it loud and clear.  Good tune.  Reminds me a bit of Flight Of Icarus.  Solid.Heaven Can Wait - Guitar synths are there but done tastefully.  This has an eerie intro that moves straight into the siganture Maiden sound and that detracts because the songs are starting to meld together.  Not as memorable as it should be.  Bruce can still wail, however, and that is great!The Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner - Uh...  Okay...  The title itself is comepletely un-metal and that made us as teenage headbangers flinch just a little bit.  Solid tune.  Bruce belts it out.  But, alas, sounds like regurgitated Maiden.  The riffs are so close to other songs that it doesn't make me like it a whole hell of a lot.  Solid, but far from great.Stranger In A Strange Land - Ambitious.  Hear that heavy, larger-than-life sound.  Great bass riffs.  Elegant.  One of the better songs on the album.  Taking it down a bit, moody and cool.  I like it.Deja Vu - If you sat down and listened to all of the Iron Maiden albums up to this poit, one right after another, you would know that this has been done before on several levels.  Is Maiden repeating themselves?  Maybe.  It's just that they're good at playing a certain way and it's starting to become tedious.  This is a good song.  The lyrics are cool and Bruce delivers them with passion and precision, but it's not going to be your favorite Maiden tune of all time.  It's not!Alexander The Great - As with Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and To Tame A Land, Maiden saves the ponderous song for last.  It's a good song, not their best, but I happen to have a soft spot for it.  This let's us know that Maiden are historically correct and that they are still thinking man's metal.  It just drags slightly.  That's all.Overall, Somewhere In Time has a large sound filled with driving riffs and slamming drums and wailing Dickinson lyrics.  It means well.  It sounds pretty good.  It just sounds a little reheated after Piece Of Mind and Powerslave.  Could that Maiden signature sound be wearing out? Not necessarily, but some of the songs lack that crucial hook that makes any song great and memorable.  From this point forward, the Maiden boys would start their eventual decline.Dig it!\n", "val": 0.009528698399662971}
{"text": "Somewhere In Time came between what I consider to be the two best albums in the Iron Maiden catalog.  On this one, they use synthesizers for the first time, and for the most part it works.  Whereas the synthesizers became more a part of the main structure of the music on Seventh Son, on this album they're used mostly for texture.Strip away the electronics, and you're left with good ol' fashioned Maiden:  Steve's propulsive, in-your-face bass, Dave and Adrian's guitars either in harmony or trading solos, Bruce's soaring voice and Nicko's drumming.  The band shared writing duties on this one more equitably than they did on past albums, although there's not a single writing credit for Bruce.As for the songs, my favorites are the first two, \"Caught Somewhere In Time\" and \"Wasted Years\".  Pretty much all the material here is good, but I have to take a couple points off \"Alexander The Great\"; the music is terrific, but the lyrics read like an encyclopedia entry.\n", "val": 0.010663065128028393}
{"text": "THE BAND: Steve Harris (bass), Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Dave Murray (guitar), Adrian Smith (guitar), Nicko McBrain (drums).THE DISC: (1986) 8 tracks clocking in at approximately 52 minutes. This is Maiden's 6th album. The 3rd release in a row to be recorded at Compass Point in Nassau, Bahamas. The disc contains a 22-page booklet with a brief intro, lyrics, band pictures and thank you's. Song writing credits: Harris with 5 songs (one co-written with Murray), and Adrian Smith with 3 songs all to himself. The enhanced CD features a nice multimedia section for your PC - including 2 videos (\"Wasted Years\" and \"Stranger In A Strange Land\"), the band's catalogue of albums, band history, family tree, itinerary from the '86-'87 Somewhere On Tour, and more. Digitally remastered in 1998. Cover art by the one and only Derek Riggs.COMMENTS: \"Powerslave\", \"Piece Of Mind\" and \"Number Of The Beast\" are my 3 favorite Maiden albums. \"Somewhere In Time\" is a great release, but I put it on that 2nd tier of Maiden discs - along with \"7th Son\", \"Brave New World\" and \"Killers\". Close at 5-stars, but not quite. But since I can't rate it at 4.5, 5 will have to do here... only because a very good album from Maiden is still light years ahead of so much of the other crap that's out there (past and present). Prior to \"Somewhere\" Maiden had released 5 albums in 5 years. Extensive touring for the \"Powerslave\" tour followed by some much needed time off pushed this release back a year to 1986. I also read that at the time, this was their most expensive and most time consuming album to date (many tracks were rehashed and then hashed again). \"Wasted Years\" is my favorite song on the disc and perhaps my all-time favorite song penned by guitarist Adrian Smith. \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" and the 8+ minute \"Alexander The Great\" are simply classic hard driving metal songs that only Iron Maiden could deliver. Though a decent song, \"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\" is in my opinion the weakest song here. With Maiden's previous 3 albums being so strong, I'd go so far as saying this is my least favorite song the band has put out in 5 years. Also new on \"Somewhere\" was the introduction of the bass and guitar 'Synth' - giving the entire album a slightly different feel. The only other comment I can make is - where did Bruce Dickinson disappear to on the writing credits? All the albums he's appeared on with Maiden he's always written or at least shared in the writing of their songs. No credits for Bruce here. Not sure why - his solo career was years away in the mid 90's. The band pictures of the group sitting in that futuristic blue car are pure cheese. \"Somewhere In Time\" ranks 4th on my list of favorites from Maiden. And, still very much essential to the music library.\n", "val": 0.0002093817020067945}

{"text": "I really hate to do this, Iron Maiden is my favorite band but I feel this needs to be said. I have all of Maiden's studio and live albums, I have this album here already a couple of years but I never really got into this one and it somewhat pisses me that fans call it Maiden's best or even one of their best.My major complaint about SIT is the constant use with synthesizers, don't get me wrong, Seventh Son is one of my favorite Maiden albums and I also listen to some 80's bands that use synths (Rush, Queensryche etc.), but this one sounds too mainstream for my taste and it somewhat sounds dated, unlike SSOASS which had keyboards and the production was way better, and technically, lyrically and musically that was a better album. And Bruce's vocals are very weird here. I also find a lot of songs on the album pointless. 'Caught Somewhere in Time' has whiny vocals in the verses, although the chorus is good, 'The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner' just drags out and becomes boring fast, 'Alexander the Great' is one of the weakest epics Maiden has ever done and 'Sea of Madness' is simply one of their worst songs.Even though there are some excellent songs. 'Wasted Years' is by far the best song on the album and is one of the best songs Adrian Smith has written, the vocals are excellent and so is the solo, and as a matter of fact, the only song on the album I usually listen from the start through the end. 'Heaven Can Wait' & 'Stranger In A Strange Land' are also good. 'Deja Vu' is the most underrated cut off the album, and is also one of the best, Bruce sounds really good and the riffs are awesome and unlike most of the tracks it sounds actually good with the synths. But that's pretty much it.All in all, this has it's moments but it is overall a poor effort. This album is for die hard fans only, newbies should get first Number of the Beast or Powerslave, these records never sound dated and still sound excellent today. Maiden has done worse than this but it still ranks in the bottom half in their catalogue, and it's easily their most overrated release.UP THE IRONS!!!\n", "val": 0.0005016714567318559}

{"text": "\"Somewhere in Time\" , coming after \"Powerslave\" and before the mind blowing \"Seventh Son\" album, continued the epic fantasy metal Maiden excelled in and took it to the next level. While most people  rest this on the shoulders of the introduction of guitar synths that are omnipresent here, Maiden's sound had a more sweeping sound to it , if you will. The sounds seem to have a little more muscle than most of \"Powerslave\".The guitar syth defenatley did have a very important role in the album though , as the full on synthesizers are used beautifully on the next album, 1988's \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\".  I have absolutley no complaints about this masterful offering by my favorite band. Though technichly not a full on concept album, Adrian Smith's songwriting on this seems to mostly revolve around the subject of time and the whole thing has kind of a \"spacey\" feel to it. The romping , thundering openrer \"Caught somewhere in time \" grabs your immediate attention and keeps it for around 6: 30 I believe.\"Wasted years\" sweeps you through its entirety, and the wrenching guitar solos on \"Sea of Madness\" are one of this albums best moments. Some very cool vocals in the midsection of \"Heaven can wait\". 'The Lonliness of the Long Distance Runner\" is probably the worst song on here , but that is by no means an indication of its quality. Soaring , epic, and awesome intro. You can feel the desolation of the soul lost in time somehere in \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", and \"Deja Vu\" pounds away furiously. One of the true overlooked Maiden gems, along with the album itself, is the closing epic \"Alexander the Great\". At over 8 minutes  , i have never found myself bored with it. Just a small notch down from \" Rime of the Ancient Mariner\".

{"text": "1986's Caught Somewhere in Time was the album of legends in creation, as Iron Maiden rose to the challenge in designing an album that was with synthesizer sounds for the first time ever. It was Pedal Synth technology and not real Keyboards like Roland and Yamaha, but the same Japanese giants of Technology that made the classic Keyboard  made that type of Synth Product, that was and still is the Pedal Synthesizer. Steve Harris is a genius when it comes to music and Bruce Dickinson is a master in shock vocals and performance, with the album being set with both things alongside the greatness of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith on dual Guitar; while Nicko Mick Brian is a fantastic drummer. Jazz took part in the Bass rifts and Rhythm rifts of the music as well as the Orchestration of the songs of Sea of Madness and Heaven Can Wait plus the Trilogy of Alexander the Great, although it is only one song, but it is the biography of his life. Caught Somewhere In Time is the Theme and it is a powerful song set in going back or forward in time, and Dej  Vu is a song that also does the same. Dej  Vu is a song that reminds me of the old Japanese Animae Cartoon Series' of the 1970s, in its sound style, and the same is with so many other songs on the album. This is indeed the finest album they did in the dawn of thier period where they began to bold themselves more and more.The Album cover is graphic as Eddie is a Terminator like figure, who is also a sort of version of Blade Runner's main character, with him being a Cop and not an assasin.

{"text": "the people that complain about this album are the same people that would complain about Metallica's Black Album when it first came out.  with this album Iron Maiden drifts away from argessive metal and shifts towards a more artsy and mature sound.  however this is there most professional sounding album until Brave New World.  the guitar work is phenominal with much of Adrian Smith's influence on the record and Bruce's voice is superb.  funny that it is about an octave lower than that of Beast or Peice of Mind, but don't worry you'll still get the air raid vocals that we all love so much.  my only complaint about the songwriting is simply The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner.\" great melody and perfect harmony but the topic is pretty lame.  but songs like the title track and Alexander the Great are magnificant achievements in songwriting. this is their leap forward album just as metallica had.  unfortunately they both changed severely afterwards although the follw-up albums actually are great.  i STRONGLY recommend this album to ANY iron maiden not just the casual though you can't judge the band without the Beast album as well.\n", "val": 0.026621898636221886}
{"text": "Somewhere in Time is another of Maiden's golden albums (from Number of the Beast to Seventh Son), yet perhaps the most overlooked of them all. The reason? I have no idea; maybe because it only has one song that ever seems to make it onto 'best of' albums (like best of the beast); that song? Wasted Years. And the fact that no song from this album seems to be regularly played as part of the band's setlist; whereas songs from Number of the Beast, Powerslave, Seventh Son, Piece of Mind are staple live items.Don't be dissuaded; I was apprehensive when I bought this album for that very reason. Yet one listen and I was reassured; this is a wonderful album without a single sub-par song. It begins Maiden's two-album use of synthesisers to 'fatten out' the sound of the songs. I must say it works very well; I personally barely notice the synths anyway but they do make the sound more full than on previous works.Somewhere in Time is somewhat of an anomaly where writing is concerned; this is often cited as 'Adrian Smith's' album, since he is involved on several of the tracks (notably Wasted Years and Stranger in a STrange land). Truly, we get to see how good Adrian smith's writing talent is on these tracks. But there's offerings from everybody, except (oddly) Bruce (and of course Nicko) - perhaps the quality was so good from everybody else that he had to wait until Seventh Son for his contributions. It makes no difference, Bruce's vocal performance is absolutely incredible on this album.I won't go into detail about all the individual songs; all are great. BUT don't overlook the oft-ignored 'Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner'. I often play this song in my head whenever I'm running any long distance (how ironic), and its very uplifting. It has some great guitar work and I love the harmonies at the start, middle and end of the song. The subject matter often baffles people, but Steve Harris based it on a BOOK. That's right, by Alan Stilletoe (I may have misspelt the surname - i don't have the book here). Its a short novel about a convict who ends up running in a marathon and 'throws' the race just to frustrate somebody he doesn't like..That's a really bad summary but it gives you some idea about the  track. Its got a weird and long title, but its awesome and I urge you to give it a listen.All in all, a superb album with incredible songs and should NEVER be overlooked in your Maiden collection.P.S. study the cover for lots of great allusions to other Maiden works and trivia (eg the 'Ancient Mariner' restaurant)Every track on this album is great; the excellent and almost operatic 'caught somewhere in time' is a great opener. Wasted Years has a memorable chorus that just makes you want to live for today (as lame as that sounds); a great Adrian Smith song.\n", "val": 0.01679934561252594}
{"text": "I love this album, but strangely enough, the first time I heard it, it didn't impress me much.  It wasn't \"Wasted Years\" or \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" that made me pick this up, but rather \"Deja Vu\".  I was in a band at the time, and was also a cartoonist, and had written a tongue-in-cheek comic book about our band in which we went forward in time to see how things would turn out.  At one point in the comic, we had to go back in time 5 minutes to prevent one of us from doing something stupid, and as I was drawing this, a friend sitting next to me said something like \"Have them listen to \"Deja Vu\" by Iron Maiden as they go back.\"  I'd never heard the song, but that's what made me curious about it.Anyway, I liked \"Deja Vu\" from the first listen, but the rest of the album did little for me.  But after a few listens, it became one of my all-time favorite albums by any artist, and remains so.  It's got a great sound to it, and there's not a weak track on the album.  \"Caught Somewhere In Time\" and \"Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\" are two of my favorite tracks.  It's funny how something you end up liking so much can start out as something you don't really care for.  But if I were stranded on a desert island and could only have a few CDs with me, this would be one of them.Oh, and the cover is great too -- check out all the hidden Maiden references!\n", "val": 0.011875859461724758}
{"text": "The Synthesizers make it quite evident, Iron Maiden has gone Progressive Metal. Although this album dosent hold up aswell as previous releases like Piece Of Mind and Powerslave, It still remains quite a good Iron Maiden album. Here's what I think of the songs.1. Caught Somewhere In Time (4.5/5)- Awesome opening riff2. Wasted Years (5/5)- a great progressive Metal song, good lyrical concept3. Sea Of Madness (2.5/5)- Bad riff, stupid lyrics4. Heaven Can Wait (4/5)- catchy although a bit pop5. Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner (1.5/5)- A terrible song, this song is about the lonliness of marathon runners, how stupid is that6. Stranger In A Strange Land (4.5/5)- Another great progressive metal song7. Deja Vu (3.5/5)- a catchy song but a stupid topic8. Alexander The Great (2/5)- a history lesson on Alexander The Great, wow it's like I'm in social classIf you like Progressive Metal or hard rock check this album out, if you like pop metal you might also like it.If you like this album you might also like:Queensryche- Operation MindcrimeDream Theatre- When Dream And Day UniteHelloween- Walls Of Jericho\n", "val": 0.01573510281741619}
{"text": "Following their earlier studio effort \"powerslave\" and a double live Lp, \"Somewhere in Time\" brings Iron Maiden back to the public with another eight solid tunes. This album's concept finds the band's 'mascot' Eddie deep into the future and still kicking major butt just as he did in the 20th century. The album feature more of guitarist Adrian Smith's work with three of the eight songs penned by the often overlooked songwriter. Smith waste no time in putting together one of the band's all-time favorites \"Wasted Years\" via track #2. Martin \"Masa\" Birch produces another set of killer sounds for the band with most songs being on par with each other giving the listener an incredibly solid collection of songs. \"Somewhere in Time\" unlike previous Maiden efforts, to me, laid flat at first but with each listen the melodies sink deeper and deeper.

{"text": "Of the first 5 Dickinson albums, this one seems to be the least popular overall.  And I suppose I agree, as it is likely my least favorite of the 5, but an album which isn't quite as good as those 4 ones can still be pretty damn good, as this album proves.  Not a good place too start with IM, I don't think, but still a very worthwhile album.This albums biggest problem is the production.  It's a bit muddled, and the guitar tone is really lousy.  IM never exactly had the most bonecrunching guitar tone around, but it was always a lot better than the shapeless, incredibly trebly and glam-metal esque guitar tone they use on this album.  Also, the synths they use tend to be a bit cheesy, but this was pretty unavoidable at the time.  (The use of guitar synths also exacerbates the guitar tone problem, and the general muddled feel of the production.)  Still, even if the production were better, this wouldn't be as good as 4 aforementioned albums.  The songwriting just isn't quite as good.'Lost Somewhere in Time' is a classic speed metal opener, but with an epic twist, in the form of the extended middle break.  A good opener, classic Maiden stuff.  'Wasted Years' is the radio song of the album, but it's still a good track.  The opening lick/riff is totally great and unforgettable, and it's just  a fast paced, fun and catchy song.  It's pretty cheesy, but in a good way, as Maiden generally is. (Still, it can't match 'Can I Play With Madness' in terms of fun cheesiness)  'Sea of Madness' is one of those tracks that took a long time to grow on me.  Truthfully, the instrumental work on the song still doesn't interest me particularly, but it has got a great, soaring chorus.  'Heaven Can Wait' seems like it would be a power-ballad, but it isn't.  It's very fast and energetic, even by Maiden standards, with a frenetic vocal performance from Bruce.  Again, the chorus, is very cheesy, particularly the synths, but it totally works anyway.  The slower middle break is fun too, particularly the dramatic 'oh-oh-oh' stuff.  'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner' is one of the most underrecognized IM songs.  It's not one of the very best ones, but it is a classic, with perhaps the most over the top, grandiose chorus they ever wrote.  Instrumentally it's strong too, with some stunning harmony leads, and solid triplet driven riffwork.  'Stranger in a Strange Land' is a ballad.  Instrumentally, it isn't particularly interesting, but Bruce's powerful voice carries the day, and it's really quite dramatic and atmospheric.  Not one of their very best songs, but still an interesting track, and it does have a nice and appropriate, other-worldly feel.  'Deja Vu' is another overlooked track, this time rightfully so, but it's certainly far from worthless.  Just another standard Maiden rocker, but it's got a nice main lick and a memorable chorus, so it's fairly worthwhile, even though it hasn't go too much else.  'Alexander the Great' is the closing epic, and it's perhaps the weakest epic of Maiden's first seven albums.  Again, however, those songs hold a very high standard, so this is another very enjoyable song.  It can be a bit meandering at times, particularly in the intro and the middle break, but the core of the song is quite strong.Yeah, I like this.  Amusing album art, too.\n", "val": 0.010291234590113163}
{"text": "As of 1986, this was Iron Maiden's weakest album.  It is still a 'must own' for Maiden fans, but does not meet the high standards that were set by albums like POWERSLAVE and SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON.  This was also the first Maiden album to use keyboards, and while they act as a refreshing element, they are not fully developed yet.  This also marks the spot in the band's history when they started writing corny songs.  The musicianship, especially the guitar harmonies and solos are excellent, but the guys were either drinking too much or nervously searching for writing ideas.The two popular songs here are 'Heaven Can Wait' and 'Wasted Years.'  'Wasted Years' is a *Top 10* Iron Maiden song with one of the best-built Adrian Smith guitar solos I can recall.  The music video was also a 'Maiden Montage' of sorts with video clips of the band and shots of all the album and single covers.  'Heaven Can Wait' became a famous concert song because of the sing-along section where the band would usually bring part of the crowd on stage.  It's also progressive in the way that it is structured - there are some themes within the song that are not repeated.Another fan favorite is the hardest rocking song on the album - 'Stranger in a Strange Land.'  They released it as a single and made a music video for it as well.  The single cover had Eddie dressed like a drifter in a bar that was reminiscent of something out of Star Wars with other 'creatures' present.  You can also find a live copy of it on the 'Maiden England' video/dvd.The other songs are somewhat progressive and feature some great musicianship, especially on 'Sea of Madness' and the title track, however to go back to what I said earlier - you can't get away with songs like 'Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner' and 'Alexander the Great' without raising a few eyebrows.  Is this a history lesson or a heavy metal album?  'Alexander the Great' reminds me of 'Stonehenge' from THIS IS SPINAL TAP.  Earlier songs like 'Killers' and 'Prowler' were simpler in lyrical content but didn't make the band look like a bunch of sissies.  I don't enjoy being that harsh about this album, but no one ever seems to bring up the cornyness of some of these tunes!To those who are considering purchasing this disc, I recommend you buy SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON first.  On that album, I believe the band reaches a point they were still aiming for on SOMEWHERE IN TIME.\n", "val": 0.006306649651378393}

They not only managed to keep their Iron Maiden sound, but they managed to take that sound into an exciting new direction, which they capitalized on with their subsequent album, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (the perfection of their experimentation with synth effects).

{"text": "As others note here, this album seems like an experiment for IM. There are synth guitars (and synth bass) here and there, and sometimes the guitars get sort of \"lost\" in all the sound they're producing--that is, at times the guitars seem quite a bit more \"distant\" than they did on previous albums. This album, as I said, marks the \"beginning of the end\" of IM because it would lead to what I believe their high-point (Seventh Son) and subsequent dismissal of Adrian Smith (the better of the two guitarists) for Jannick Gers, who I saw live in 1991 and about made me want to puke he was so bad. \"No Prayer for the Dying,\" the album after Adrian's departure, was the last draw and I quit liking IM after that point.After about 10 years of smooth jazz, I decided it was time to rediscover my roots, and I went back to the first IM album I ever heard or owned: Somewhere in Time (incidentally, I bought it for no other reason than being attracted to the album cover art--I had never heard them before). Seriously, I think this album is worth picking up. It is fair to their older style and also a caustic segue into Seventh Son. Some argue whether this is a concept album or not (the concept being time travel), and I would say \"maybe.\" If it is a concept album, \"Sea of Madness\" and \"Long Distance Runner\" are out of place. The others all could be considered \"time-travel relevant.\" Perhaps this mild coherence between songs led to the full-blown and subsequent concept album \"Seventh Son\" (in which the concept is death/duying/religion/spiritual stuff)--which is bookended by a 20 second creepy acoustic-vocal inclusio.The goods: Sometimes very raw (Title track), fast and heavy (Long Distance Runner), well-crafted (Alexander the Great) and sometimes written with a live crowd in mind (Heaven Can Wait), and other times subdued (Stranger in a Strange Land). I'm NOT with most fans, in that I DON'T care too much for \"Sea of Madness\" (bass-line sort of flat), and \"Deja Vu\" (just doesn't sit well with me - I can't explain why). However, the guitar solos on ALL the tracks are worth it--especially Adrian's solos. This album, like its predecessor \"Powerslave,\" is all Adrian. The high-points of the album are his two solos from \"Wasted Years\" and \"Stranger in a Strange Land,\" although the two guitar solo banter in \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" raises eyebrows even after 20 years. In my honest opinion, this is also the coolest Eddie of all their albums, and the most unique. Perhaps in the wake of Robocop and Terminator, this Eddie may seem a bit passe, but the artwork is magnificent. Eddie as a cyborg robot! Whodathunkit?This one is at the top of my IM list; the others that I would pick up are (at least) Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and Live After Death. With these three albums, you've got the high-point of the career of one of Britain's best metal bands.The lowdown:1. Caught Somewhere in Time: 4/52. Wasted Years: 5/53. Sea of Madness: 3/54. Heaven Can Wait: 4/55. Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner: 5/56. Stranger in a Strange Land: 5/57. Deja Vu: 4/58. Alexander the Great: 5/5And from the B-sides of this era:1. Reach Out: 5/5 - if Maiden had written this one themselves, it would have been a huge hit. I believe that's Adrian Smith on lead vocals, with Bruce singing back-up.2. Juanita: 5/5 - The Charlotte the Harlot theme continues (post-22 Acacia Avenue) with this track. The rhythm guitar is reminiscent of the Powerslave era, and is low and heavy. The lyrics can be somewhat dirty, but it's worth it to hear Bruce's shrieking laughter near the end of the song. You'll know why when you hear it.3. Sherriff of Huddersfield: 2/5 - If the song didn't include Bruce's strange dialogue with himself while the music is playing, this would be a great track. As it stands, it's very, very strange (vocally), but the musicianship is great.4. That Girl: 3/5 - Has a neat guitar intro, but the song lacks that charecteristic Maiden-esque drive that charecterizes most of their songs. The lyrics are not something Maiden would have written on their own, as I believe this is a cover track like most of the B-sides off of Somewhere in Time.5. Total Eclipse: 3/5 - this track is a left-over from the \"Number of the Beast\" days. Nothing special.6. Remember Tomorrow (live): 5/5 - Would you like to hear how Bruce sounds singing an under-rated Paul Di'Anno classic? This is it! Very fun song which was sung by IM's best vocalist. They don't play this one anymore, so if you can find a copy of it, grab it.UP THE IRONS!\n", "val": 4.004402217105962e-05}
{"text": "I bought this  really soon after I got hooked on a burnt copy of powerslave, I didn't really know what to expect but I was pretty damn surprised at the synthwork, this album defenitely marks a high point in the musicianship aspect of maiden, even though they were never sloppy before.Alot of the percussion has more double bass than what you're used to hearing from nicko (not a bad thing at all) and the bass is just as melodic and pounding as before, and they are all just kicking ass througout... but the production seems a little more distant and sometimes the guitars get buried under it which means that alot of the melodies are not as clean and clear as they should be but the risky move pays off because the synths add alot to the songs... even though they defenitely comes off a little too strongly once in a while.There are a few songs on this album that are catchy (heaven can wait, stranger in a strange land, wasted years) but don't really have the substance of the others...The songs caught somewhere in time, and the lonilness of the long distance runner have some of Iron maidens most elegant melodies... and they're also heavier than most of what theyve done up to this point in the classic era. Sea of madness also has a really awesome chorus... and alexander the great is pretty good, even though there is sort of a noodling section in it that doesnt mesh well with the song.I think the good songs on this album, are defenitely worth the price (actually the best songs on somewhere in time would give anything on piece of mind or powerslave a run for their money) but there are also alot of other sections where it gets repetetive, and the songs all tend to blur into each other... there is a pretty well defined prog thing going on here too, and a few of the songs lose momentum because there are some relentlessly mean solos that unfortunately drag on a bit, but the guys always pull the songs back into perspective just before you're ready to get frustrated or bored.If you were to just buy this album,having never heard any other Iron maiden albums, it would stand pretty high on its own, but Id probably get any one of the other three \"classic dickinson\" maiden albums first... even though some of my favorite iron maiden songs are on this album.\n", "val": 0.005108591169118881}

{"text": "Somewhere In Time, Iron Maiden's 6th album, and in my opinion their best up to that year.In the late 80's, metal music was changing, becoming more daring. Bands were implementing new and different instruments for a better sound. This is the album where Maiden did just that.Using guitar-synths, and using them exceptionally well, Iron Maiden released Somewhere In Time in 1986. Hidden in between Powerslave and Seventh Son, this album may be sometimes forgotten, but make no mistake, this album is one of Maiden's best ever.Caught Somewhere In Time comes at you straight away, and already you can hear these guitar synths improving the sound, giving it a \"futuristic\" feel. It's a great opening song, but it is only the beginning, as things get even better.Wasted Years is the next track, and one of, if not the best Maiden song ever. The whole song is awesome and catchy and stays in your head for a long time. It is so popular, many other bands have done their own versions of this masterpiece, whether it be for a tribute album, or a part of the band's own album.If you can stop yourself from repeating Wasted Years over and over, the next track is called Sea Of Madness. It's a good song, with the typical Maiden feel with heavy Harris bass. Not the best track on the album, but still good.Heaven Can Wait comes next and it's another top song on the album. Very popular when performed live, as it gets the fans involved, and it's just as good when listening at home. If your not singing along during the middle part, you're just not a Maiden fan.The next song, The Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner, in my opinion, is the poorest song on the album. Although it has great guitar riffs, the structure and the way it is sung always annoyed me. And as a result I could never get into it.The second best track on this album is next, Stranger In A Strange Land. From beginning to end, the song is supurb and a classic. It's everything you want in a Maiden track, with a killer solo too.Deja-Vu is the next track, and again it is rathy catchy and you'll find yourself singing it in your head once you've listened to it. A rockin' track which I think should be included more often in Iron Maiden's live shows.The album ends with a bang with Alexander The Great. An awesome epic track which could stand side by side with Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and To Tame A Land. Simply brilliant.In my opinion, I think Somewhere In Time is Iron Maiden's 2nd best album out of the 13 studio albums they have done, in terms of best to least best. If you don't have this album yet, go out and buy it right now.(rating each song is as follows: 0.98-1= killer track, 0.95-0.97= awesome track, 0.90-0.93= very good track, 0.85-0.88= OK/good track, 0.80-0.83= poor/average track.

{"text": "Somewhere In Time is the first studio-album from Iron Maiden I have ever heard and it is still one of my favourite albums of all time. Somewhere In Time, released in 1986, was the first album on which Maiden uses guitar and bass synths. It gives the album a different vibe when comparing it to their earlier albums. The album starts out with \"Caught Somewhere In Time\", one of the most underrated Maiden songs of all time. This song always grabs me when the intro starts. \"Wasted Years\" is one of Maiden's more radio- friendly songs. In the Netherlands it was Maiden's greatest hit. It is a catchy rocker, written by Adrian Smith.Although the guitars on Somewhere In Time do not sound heavy due to the synths, I would say that Somewhere In Time contains the fastest songs Maiden has ever released. Just listen to \"Loneliness Of The Long Distant Runner\" and \"Heaven Can Wait.\" Fortunately there are also some slower song like \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" and \"Alexander The Great\". \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" is an atmospheric simple bass and drums based song, with an excellent solo. Therefore  it is a pretty unusual song, but it is still great. \"Alexander The Great\" is a rather slow and epic song. This song probably contains the longest guitar-solo Maiden has ever played on an album. It is one of my favourite Maiden solos. \"Sea Of Madness\" is the heaviest (guitar-sound wise) song on the album. Check out the intro of \"Sea Of Madness\". I think that this song is also one of the must underrated Maiden songs.I personally think that Somewhere In Time is one of Maiden's strongest albums. I really like the desolate atmosphere on the album. The whole sound on the album is totally different than on all of their other albums. Even Bruce Dickinson's vocals sound different. Although I am normally not a fan of high range vocals, the vocals on this album work perfectly. The songs are both catchy and complex (for Maiden standards). Although Somewhere In Time is not one of Maiden's easiest albums to get into, I highly recommend this album.\n", "val": 0.03667278587818146}
{"text": "After Powerslave, Maiden became too comfortable with themselves and their sound; Bruce Dickinson has acknowledged this.  This explains the reason why this was where Maiden began to lose their edge.  With Paul Dianno, Maiden had established themselves as an aggressive metal band full of truly talented musicians and no-nonsense approach to the genre.  With the classic Dickinson albums, they mixed old-fashioned metal with eloquent lyrics and complex song structures.  While Somewhere in Time is a more progressive album than the previous ones, it often sounds more like a pop-rock album than a heavy metal one.For Somewhere in Time, Bruce wanted it to be entirely acoustic, but of course that idea fell through.  Having most of his creative ideas rejected, it was really up to Steve and Adrian to make this album what it was.  The title track is good, as is the commercial rocker Wasted Years.  Sea of Madness is the best song on the album, with Bruce's incredible vocals and some great riffing by Dave and Adrian.  The complex guitars and a great melodic section 3/4 of the way through make this the most interesting songs on the album.  Heaven Can Wait has some great lyrics that are killed by the synths and cheesy chorus.  The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner is a somewhat silly song, and Stranger in a Strange Land is bland, despite a great solo by Adrian.  Deja-Vu is a minor song on the album, but also one of the most entertaining.  Alexander the Great wants to be an epic in the style of Rime of the Ancient Mariner, but instead it comes off as a self-parody.What really stops the album from being a dynamic heavy metal album are the synthesizers, which were put to better use in Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  All of Steve's and Adrian's lyrics are great, but the production of the album stops it from ever sounding as great as it could have sounded.  Instead of adding to the sound, the synths simply wash out the guitars and drums.  The lack of lyrics by Bruce is also a major problem, because he has proven himself to be a great songwriter time and again with songs like Revelations, Powerslave, and 2 Minutes to Midnight.This is definitely a more commercialized Maiden, and somewhat out-of-touch with their roots.  Unlike albums like Killers and Number of the Beast, which still sound great today, Somewhere in Time sounds very light.  I would put this album somewhere in the middle of Maiden's discography, quality-wise.  Not bad, but definitely not the best.\n", "val": 0.0033702461514621973}
{"text": "Iron Maiden's golden age started with \"Killers\" and pretty much ended with \"Somewhere in Time\". All of the songs on \"Somewhere\" are ambitious, adding new elements to Maiden's sound. The guitar synth's found on \"Somewhere\" are present, but not as overpowering as on the follow-up cd \"Seventh Son\". Everything Maiden fans enjoy about the band are present on \"Somewhere\". Steve Harris' bass lines crackle, and Dickinson's urgent vocals really carry the album along. The guitar riffs are catchy, and hook you right away. The thing that always impressed me with Iron Maiden, was that, during the 80's most metal bands like Ratt, Posion, Motley Crue etc, were busy playing and singing about rock n' roll, girls and partying. Maiden often based their music on literature; \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", poetry: \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", history; \"Aces High\", \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills\"; religion; \"Heaven Can Wait\", \"Number of the Beast\" and mythology \"Icarus\" and \"Poweslave\". The great epic metal tunes on Iron Maiden disks defied the conventions of the time, where most bands stuck to radio-friendly, 5 minutes or less rock anthems. Iron Maiden was, and is more than just a standard metal band, and if you are a music fan, you are doing yourself a great dis-service if you don't pick up the disks from the heyday. \"Somewhere in Time\" features 8 great track, each better than the one before it. Listen to \"Alexander the Great\" and ask yourself if any other band at the height of their popularity would have been able to put that song on a cd. The guitar riff on \"Wasted Years\" will be running through your head all day, and you will be humming the chorus of \"Heaven Can Wait\" for a long time. This is a great album, from a band that always brought a little more to the table than just catchy rock anthems.\n", "val": 0.015041641891002655}

This album also produces some brilliant but less typival iron maiden songs like Sea of madness and Wasted Years. A must own for any Iron Maiden fan\n", "val": 0.06279169768095016}
{"text": "Maiden never disappointed in the 80's, and this is certainly no exception. Iron Maiden's sixth album, Somewhere In Time (1986), is perhaps the greatest progressive metal album of all time. It's no Number Of The Beast, but what Maiden CD (aside from that) is? NONE! Anyway, SIT is probably their third best album in my opinion. It features some things that were new to the band at the time: the incorporation of guitar/bass SYNTHS into their music. Overall, it all works out pretty well, they almost sounded like Fate's Warning had moved to England, which is good. And now, of course, the three highlights of the album. \"Caught Somewhere In Time\" is another prime example of how metal albums open well. It starts out as a slow duel of guitar vs. g. synth, then turns into a speed-metal blowout! Track 2, \"Wasted Years,\" features one of the greatest guitar intros ever done by the band. It also features one of the greatest choruses of all time. And \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" is an eerie mid-tempo heavy rocker with one of my favorite bass-lines ever. Overall, this album is definetely recommended for Maiden fans, as well as various prog-metal acts, like Kings-X, Fate's Warning, Dream Theater, and Andromeda, among others. ROCK HARD, RIDE FREE!

{"text": "Somewhere in Time is my favorite album from the best band to ever come out of England. This was a very hard choice to make as Powerslave, Brave New World, and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son came very close.  Iron Maiden have amazed me with their incredible talent and ability to use different elements in their music.  Bruce Dickenson has a great vocal range, and it shows on this album.The album starts off with the title track, which introduced guitar synth from the leads.  This was a risky move by Maiden, but in my opinion, it worked perfectly.  The track, Wasted Years is a good song and I like the chorus.  The song, Heaven can Wait is the catchiest song off of this album, and will be in your head for days!!  (this is not a bad thing) I love the part in the middle of the song the best.  The 2 best songs on this cd are, Stranger in a Strange Land, and Alexander the Great!  Both of these songs are worthy for a spot on a greatest hits list.  The vocals on 'Alexander' are nothing less than amazing, and the guitar soloists are at their best on 'Stranger.'This cd was a great follow-up to Powerslave, and Iron Maiden continue to stick to their roots even today, with their newest release, titled 'Dance of Death.'  I urge all Iron Maiden fans to pay the extra money to see this band live.  Trust me, they are worth it!  Bruce and the rest of their original linup from 'Number of the Beast' are the best!  I saw them live in Los Angeles, CA for their Dance of Death tour.  Please buy their albums, and if Maiden comes close to your city, their live performance is one NOT to be missed.  UP THE IRONS!!\n", "val": 0.06722677499055862}
{"text": "For their 6th release, Maiden opted to expand their musical soundscape with synthesizers, which were actually all the rage in the 80s. The idea made many fans feared an over-commercialization of their sound; that the band was selling out. 1986's \"Somewhere in Time\" proved the fears wrong, and the merging between true Heavy Metal and synthesizers was a great success.The first song and title track \"Cought Somewhere in Time\" was a powerful 7- minute Epic that serves to sum up the album. Next is the hit single, and one of my favourites, \"Wasted Years\" a melancholic Adrian Smith-penned power ballad. \"Sea of Madness\" is a very heavy song, probably the heaviest in the album. Following it is the \"short\" epic Heaven Can Wait, a concert favourite and shout-along anthem that will stay in your head for days. \"Lonliness of the Long Distance Runner\" is an obvious throw-back at 70s-Prog-Rock Gods Yes's \"Long Distance Runaround\". While the lyrics are very weak, the upbeat solo, great intro and solid chorus save the song. The album's other single \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" is another slow melancholic song, but much heavier than Wasted Years and just as intense. \"De Ja Vu\" is a light, fast rocker of the album, good concept too and great intro. Like nearly all Maiden Closers, the last song on this album is the epic \"Alexander The Great\", a powerful finish to the album, displaying spoken word intros and a marital-pace clean-guitar intro before kicking into the historical biographic Epic.The production is very different from any other, and the guitars are pushed back and very fuzzy, yet the synths don't take over the sound either, while Bruce also sounds distant. If it doesn't read well, don't worry, the effect makes for a very interest sound that is increadibly \"epic\" and surprisingly fresh. The sound would be similar in the next album, but not as drastically different.While Somewhere in Time does not surpass the increadible and straight-forward \"Powerslave\" nor it's own synth-laden follow-up \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\", it is nonetheless one of the quintessential Maiden releases that features many great songs plus a side to Maiden that is different from any other of their albums.Caught Somewhere in Time- 10/10Wasted Years- 10/10Sea of Madness- 8.5/10Heaven Can Wait- 10/10Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner- 9/10Stranger in a Strange Land- 9/10De Ja Vu- 9/10Alexander the Great- 8.5/10\n", "val": 0.01253899373114109}

And who would have thought that the result would sound great and as heavy as it was on their previous albums ? Well, that's what happened with SIT.1-Caught somewhere in time : A 7 minutes opener that just \"lifts\" you into the album. Listen to it with headphones, you'll be blown away. 10/102-Wasted years : Adrian Smith first try at a more pop song that would later drive him out of Iron Maiden. Great riff, great chorus, great song. 9,5/103-Sea of madness : Very underrated song. It's get better every day. Great display of emotion in the voice of Bruce. 9,5/104-Heaven can wait : Very nice melodic and fast song. Interesting lyrics. 9/105-The loneliness of the long distance runner : Again, very fast and melodic. The song resumes the near past of the band, especially during the world slavery tour. 9/106-Stranger in a strange land : It was chosen to be the 2nd single. Not the best of choices, the weakest song on the album but still a very good one. The solo performed by Adrian Smith is something. 8,5/107-Dj-vu : Another fairly unknown and underrated song that, like Heaven can wait and the loneliness, is very fast and melodic. 9,5/108-Alexander the Great : Steve Harris the Great ! Once again, a masterpiece of an epic that is vintage Harris. 10/10By some fans, this album is not well rated. It's hard to understand because it's one of their strongest efforts ever.

{"text": "It's very smart of Iron Maiden to start changing their music's sound because the old Heavy Metal style would probably make some people think \"these guys are old\". Fortunatly for you Maiden fans who loved the old sound, you probably already know, but Iron Maiden have returned to their Heavy Metal sound. Anyway this great album is more progressive than heavy, and also begins the use of synthesizers, but it's still cool.Caught Somewhere In Time: 5/5 - The title-track opens the album with a melodic instrumental beginning, a very cool one I might add. Soon the song would be blasting your poor stereo to death with an unexpected shock-wave of fast-paced music. The chorus is also very interesting since not many people enjoy it. A must-listen-to opener.Wasted Years: 5/5 - The first track I actually heard from this album was my favourite. It begins with a pretty good solo before turning progressive, also includes a very catchy rythem. I'm glad this song was a single because I'm sure that many people would argue that this song was extremely underated. A great song, deserves to be on this album.Sea Of Madness: 5/5 - Why, why, why wasn't this song a single? It's one of the best on the album, has a great chorus and I can imagine what a video of this song would be like. This is perhaps the heaviest song on the album, the intro is spectacular and I don't think I've heard Nicko give the drums such a brutal beating, but that seems to be a good thing. The solo and acoustic sounds through the midway on this song are awesome. Bruce sings the chorus beautifully, and I finally hear a rough bass from Steve.Heaven Can Wait: 3.7/5 - Pretty good track, has everything a song should have, including a lousy chorus. I'm serious, I really don't like the chorus! Thank god it has a great midway and cool solos.The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner: 4.9/5 - Perhaps Iron Maiden's only song with a really long title, an excellent track with an awesome intro, I mean just hear it! The sound is the best sound than can be used for an intro. I only knocked off 0.1 points because I couldn't understand the lyrics.Stranger In A Strange Land: 5/5 - The first great bass intro I've heard since the album Killers. A very interesting song with awesome lyrics. The only unmarked flow is that it's not too long because with a solo and rythem to a song like this, the song should be a bit longer than 6 minutes. Still, this is a must-hear by any Iron Maiden follower.Deja Vu: 5/5 - Another cool intro but I think I should give my comments on the whole song, so here we go: WOW! WOW! WOW! Maybe the 5th best song on the album and might deserve higher.The music rocked my innocent stereo out almost immediately like dropping a hot potato on your reproductive system(no offense!). If you haven't heard it, I demand that you either get the album or download the song, it's worth it.Alexander The Great: 5/5 - Take some time to appreciate the intro(music, not words), cool beginning solo, almost made mecry(honestly), but The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner has the better solo intro.This song is over 8 minutes long, the longest track on the album followed by the 7+ minutes title-track. The song tells just about everything you really need to know about Alexander, except I don't think I heard any thing about his death throughout the song. Still, this song is more worthy than the entire album itself! Hear this song or wasted your chances of of being an ex-Maiden loser.Rare tracks from this era:Reach Out: 5/5 - Great, solid B-Side. Could've been on the album if their weren't many long songs. Download!The Sheriff Of Huddersfield: 5/5 - Amazing track, very comedic when the Sheriff(I think)talks about how strong and dangerous he is. Must be heard by fans only.That Girl: 5/5 - I really love this song, it has some of the best guitar, bass and drum work ever! This really made feel more desperate for my girlfriend's saftey.Juanita: 4/5 - Weird title for a strange track. Not an excellent track because of the way it's sung, but the chorus and music save it from crapiness.Lineup:Steve Harris - Bass GuitarNicko McBrain - DrumsAdrian Smith - GuitarDave Murray - GuitarBruce Dickinson - VocalsOverall: Awesome album, deserves a chance to be one of Iron Maiden's top 5 albums of all-time. Also the rare tracks should have been included because they're all great, including Juanita.GO! GO! GO get this album if ya ain't ownin' it because I couldn't find it and I ended up downloading every song on this album.\n", "val": 0.02472677268087864}

CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME (9.5/10)Great way to start the album. This song has sweet use of guitars and keyboards do well. The chorus does get a bid repetitive which is the only reason I didn't give it a 10.2. WASTED YEARS (10/10)Now this song is great! The guitar intro is cool, and sounds futuristic. The chorus is the best part. Can't get enough of this song. It's my favorite on the album.3. SEA OF MADNESS (8.5/10)Pretty decent song with great vocals. Chorus is good too.4. HEAVEN CAN WAIT (8.5/10)The intro is great and all but I get annoyed by the repetitive chorus.5. THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER (9.5/10)Man, this song is cool. It has a galloping feel to it, like you're there running too. The lyrics are the only bad part, which are kind of goofy. Still a great song anyway.6. STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND (10/10)This song has a slower pace than the others. Great riffs and keyboards. I love the guitar solo after the chorus, beautiful!7. DE JA VU (8.5/10)Another decent song. Starts off good but then when he starts saying \"it feels prearranged\" and stupid things like that it, sounds goofy. The chorus is goofy too.8. ALEXANDER THE GREAT (9.5/10)A nice epic but doesn't live up to Hallowed Be Thy Name or Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The guitars sound great and the drums are done well. The thing I don't like is that Bruce sounds like he's reading the lyrics from a text book like some reviewer said before. The chorus is good.

{"text": "Well... Iron Maiden hit its peek with POWERSLAVE and so after that there is nowhere to go but down and that is where this album was headed, but that's not to say the band didn't have a few good punches to throw, but after such a powerful record, the fans expected more but many fans feel the delivery failed, but I think it was one of the last great albums of the time, before this band and the genre became washed-up.During the mid-80's a phenomenon was sweeping the music scene globally and locally; synthesizers. It seemed every band had a synth player, even Van Halen and The Ramones were using synths in nearly every song by 1984. So now came Maiden's turn, but what set them apart from the others is that they didn't over do it. The synths are faint at the most and overall complement the music rather than date it.CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME- Normal Maiden opener but this time with synths! Hah? Right! 5/5WASTED YEARS- This has to be one of the most powerful \"get off your ass and do something with your life songs\" I've ever heard. Definate influence on 90's Power-metal. 5/5SEA OF MADNESS- Pretty heavy song, great guitar and vocals. 5/5HEAVEN CAN WAIT- Ehh... i've heard better from Maiden, not too bad, but I think the lyrics need work. 4/5THE LONELINESS OF A LONG DISTANCE RUNNER - Great song but the lyrics are bad just plain awful. 4/5DEJA VU- The album takes a little turn and mellows it out and this is another strong track up there with STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND and WASTED YEARS. 5/5STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND - best song on the album! just listen to that solo!! and take in those lyrics baby! 5/5ALEXANDER THE GREAT - I'm a History major and when I was in high school this is the song that pretty much got through a chapter in History and influenced me to study.

Contrary to popular believe i think that this is the best and ranks up there with Piece of Mind and Number of the Beast. This album its viewed as the futuristic album of Maiden and it shows in the way the instruments were recorded. They used synths on guitars and drums to make it sound different. But by being different it doesn't mean that is bad or terrible, because this album is filled with brilliant songwriting. Unlike St. Anger by Metallica or any album by a nu-metal band especially Slipknot.

I also want to point out that the production ( on the whole album, but especually this song) is just spectacular! You get so caught up in the song you neglect to realize is tracks at over 7 minutes... in fact you wish it were longer! A++Wasted Years: The song that made me pick up the album in the first place. This would also be the last of their \" seven consecutive gold records\" One of my favorite songs to sing along with.  ASea of Madness: IMO, the weakest track on the album ( but still a great song) I suppose I olny say that because the riffs on this one aren't memorable as the other song's... still has great lyrics to sing along with!  BHeaven Can Wait: Oh Yeah!! It's safe to say a lot of people who own this album loves this song the most.

The guitar playing is top notch and while the lyrics aren't as great as other Maiden songs, it works for me... give this one a listen!  A++Stranger in a Strange Land: Another song that was released as a single... I actually like this one more than Wasted Years. One thing that I've always loved about Maiden is their rhythm... this song is a great example of that... oh yeah, Adrians solo is quite sweet, too!  A+Deja Vu: Perhaps their shortest song title? I find this song a little clever because, besides Dave's guitar intro, most of this song incorporates little bits and pieces from the other songs on this album... besides the title track and Sea of Madness, this would be my fave song to sing along with.  AAlexander the Great: The album closes with the epic song about... well, Alexander the Great! The lyrics are biographical and basically tells you of his rise and fall. Another memorable riff and a powerful chorus!  A+...

{"text": "I'd like to say that this is probably the 2nd most influencial album in the Maiden catalog. My favorite along with the monster known as Powerslave! Here's how I rate each song:1. Caught Somewhere in Time-a dark brooding opener. Very, very fast and loud. An 8 minute song that gets you pumped up. Absolutely the best song on the album.2. Wasted Years-the first single of the album. A very eerie and futuristic intro will warn you of the power of this song. Both lyrically and musically.3. Sea of Madness-The loudest song Maiden has made. Thundering drums, screaming guitars, and a heavy bass coupled with Bruce's signature voice makes this an absolute Maiden classic.4. Heaven Can Wait-a very uplifting song if you ask me. You can't help but smile while listening to this. Although its fun, the power of the band can't get past this.5. Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner-Its unknown if they based it on the old movie with the same title. This is very very cool if it wasn't for the cheesy lyrics.6. Stranger in a Strange Land-the other single of the album. A soft track which bursts into a pummeling chorus. Beautiful.7. De Ja Vu-definetely my favorite song on this album. Very very fast and Bruce is in total top shape! I love the chorus and Bruce is growling in the verses! Classic! Classic!8. Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.)-the unbelievable ending to a great album. A history lesson in just 8 minutes! Unbelievable!Up the Irons!Overall, this is one hell of an album! A must have to every metal fan or Maiden fan. UP THE IRONS!\n", "val": 0.039871107786893845}
{"text": "It's unbelievable how many people mention Nicko's work here with very modest words! For the unenlightened: In the drummers' world, he's often cited as the world's fastest right foot. And this album shows this _fact_ clearly. I can't imagine that even the foot-profs like Virgil Donati, Simon Phillips or Gregg Bissonette could play some of these songs with one foot.OK let's begin. Listen closely to the \"Caught Somewhere in Time\", after the intro. He does these 8th-triplets and doubles in an mind-numbing tempo with his right foot (4th note at ~140-150 bpm), without a sweat. Even if you can manage to do it once or twice, you can't endure that long.If you don't get satisfied with that, then listen to \"Deja-Vu\"! Pretty much the same incredible foot-work, but now with the addition of some very nicely placed hi-hat opens. He pulls off it very easily but don't you try this at home.If you need more than speed & endurance, then take \"Wasted Years\". He hits the bass drum every 4th downbeat, whereas opens the hi-hat every 3th, playing some independent paradiddles with the hands, and makes it odd-time by adding an extra note every 2 measures. It took me years (though without much practicing, and with the \"independence-feel\", not computing the times) to play that chop. I've heard many Maiden cover-albums with this song in it, but no drummer can play it as fluent as Nicko does. And creatively, he wrote one of the most distinct and unforgettable grooves to one of the heavy metal's finest melodies (Adrian's intro). From a creativity point of view, in my book this rhythm proudly stands next to Gene Krupa, Neil Peart or Steve Gadd grooves. IMO, a nice groove should be complicated in its simplicity, and Nicko definitely manages to do that.Though the album is full of Nicko's gems, his snare-roll on \"Alexander the Great\"s intro deserves particular mention: It is one of most homogeneous rolls I've ever heard in an album, you can't hear the initial speeding-up or force exertion, it simply begins and ends, like a car goes from 0 to 60mph in zero time! The vaguely-heard bass & hihat notes give it an even nicer edge.Although Nicko didn't compose a song until recent \"Dance of Death\" his additions to Maiden albums, and especially \"Somewhere in Time\" are fine compositions in themselves.Well, if you've listened to the album and still don't get convinced with his talent, I'd say you better need a slap on the back!Anyway, surely he isn't a technical freak like Steve Smith, Mike Mangini or Terry Bozzio, but his performance on this album is the reason that I've started playing the drums 17 years ago and it's still in my \"best of\" list, and he's hell of a nice \"band drummer\" (his solos are funny :P). Too bad, _IMHO_, he couldn't match this performance & originality; except Brave New World came very close. Whatever.. In his style I'd say \"This guy is 'kin' unbelievable he is\" ;)\n", "val": 0.007703531067818403}
{"text": "While it did take me a few listens to get used to, somewhere in time is arguably their best album ever. It's full of quick, heavy riffs, really cool guitar synth, and amazing solos. Here's a quick break down of the CD.Caught somewhere in time - (4.5/5) - The first track, and the title track, is easily one of the best songs on the cd. It's extremely underated. It starts slow with the heavy guitar synth, then suddenly takes off into the main song. The normal guitars work very well with the Synth here.Wasted Years - (4/5) - Another outstanding track. The chorus is incredible, the verse is simple, yet works wonderfully. Proclaimed as one of maidens best songs, I've got no place arguing with that. A must-hear.Sea of Madness - (4/5) - No slow intro here. It starts fast and heavy and continues like that the whole song. Another wonderful chorus, and the lyrics are well done too. Don't even think about skipping this.Heaven can wait - (5/5) - ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS OF ALL TIME! Starts out slow and picks up speed. This is a very upbeat song, and its absolutely amazing. You can listen to it again and again and never get tired of it. So do that.The lonlieness of a long distance runner - (4.5/5) - What a title, eh? This song is another good one. It's amazing what Iron Maiden can write songs about. Another underrated classic.Stranger in a Strange Land - (4.5/5) - Wicked bass work at the beginning, then kicks in to a slow heavy beat. Awesome song, one of my favorites.Deja-Vu - (4/5) - Yet another underrated song, this song starts off really slow, then hammers into a fast and heavy verse. Another one of my favorites, don't skip it.Alexander the Great - (4/5) - Probably my least favorite song on the cd, but by no means is it a bad one. The song starts off slowly, and maintains a march-like beat through most of the song (which is quite long). Don't skip it.-------------------------The bottom line: I recomend this to all Iron Maiden fans, new and old. Give it a chance, and you'll become addicted. 5 stars.\n", "val": 0.035224031656980515}
{"text": "Following 4 absolutely beautiful albums put up by Iron Maiden from 1982 to 1985, how could they possibly follow it up (and also Powerslave) with their next album?  Well Iron Maiden decided to experiment a little, and with synths as well.  The first single, Wasted Years was definitely quite a commercial 80s song, so is this a commercial sell out?  Definitely not at all.1. Caught Somewhere In Time: Best song on the album, and absolutely amazing with the brilliant instrumental intro, one of the best ever.  Bruce Dickinson's singing is great, controlled at times, and the air-raid siren we all know of at times.  Great solos done by Adrian Smith and Dave Murray as well, and some thunderous bass by Steve Harris.Rating: A+2. Wasted Years: By far the most commercial song on the album, but isn't a bad one with the awesome intro and great solo by Adrian Smith.  The rest of the song is somewhat standard.Rating: B3. Sea of Madness: Another awesome song, and probably the heaviest song on the album as well.  Has a great intro riff and verse riff, and Bruce's singing is absolutely superb on this song, going from normal (verse), to mysterious (pre-chorus), to melodic (chorus).  Great song, not to be missed.Rating: A4. Heaven Can Wait: Another classic off the album, with an awesome intro, but the best part of the song has got to be the somewhat instrumental middle part, with all the (ooh's).  A great riff behind it, and later some great lead guitar work.  So awesome...Rating: B+5. Loneliness of the Long Distance: Sadly, Iron Maiden once again could not keep a filler out of their album.  But don't go skipping this song already, its a good.  Good riffs and a fast paced song mark this one, but the lyrics (not the singing) are downright terrible.  I'd reccomend for a first listen, listen to it without the lyrics.Rating: B6. Stranger In A Strange Land: A melodic Maiden classic.  Absolutely brilliance on the verse.  Pure \"awesomeness\".Rating: A-7. Deja Vu: Another filler, but a great song!  The lyrics aren't too deep, but the singing (the effect at least) is awesome, and makes the song sound kinda eerie.  Good riffs, but my one complaint is the main riff seems kinda, simple.  Good chorus, as well.Rating: A-8. Alexander the Great: Obviously another attempt at a \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", but it definitely fails.  One reviewer said that it sounded like Bruce was reading out of a history book, and he's right.  Try going without knowing the lyrics for the first listen.  Good chorus and some nice riffs as well.Rating: BYea, just go get this album, its worth it.\n", "val": 0.026520133018493652}

What a year!!!I was already a huge Maiden fan at the time, and after growing up with the epic releases \"Number Of The Beast\", \"Piece Of Mind\", and \"Powerslave\", I must say that \"Somewhere In Time\" was quite a refreshing change of pace...This is one of the few Maiden releases I still go back to today when I want to hear the best of Iron Maiden. Even today, in 2003, this still sounds as fresh as ever. This was way ahead of it's time, and is nothing short of a masterpiece....It opens on fire with \"Caught Somewhere In Time\", the fastest, most melodic futuristic ride of your life. The other favorites of mine are \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea Of Madness\", \"Deva Vu\", \"Heaven Can Wait\", \"Stranger In A Stranger Land\", and my personal favorite \"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\".....I think \"Somewhere In Time\" was also one of the best melodic efforts Iron Maiden ever produced. Both Dave and Adrian were in top form here, and the solos some of their best ever. The whole band was really focused here, as you can tell by listening to the flawless muscianship. Not even one song really leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and that's a pretty rare occurance in this business. Don't miss out on this masterpiece. It's one of Iron Maiden's finest hours.

{"text": "After the highly successful `World Slavery Tour' Iron Maiden had their work cut out for them for a follow-up. `Somewhere in Time' is not a bad album, in fact it has some great songs on it, but I don't think it stands up well against the likes of `Piece of Mind', `Number of the Beast', or `Powerslave'. The cover also portrays one of the strangest incarnations of Eddie. From a skeletal mummy, he now appears to be a human without skin.The title track starts off promising as does `Wasted Years' made famous by their MTV video. It was great to see the band jamming in a recording studio and having Eddie's six year history flashed everywhere like subliminal messages. The other single, and my favorite track is `Stranger in a Strange Land'. I think it was about the Neanderthal that scientists had found in an icy wasteland a few years earlier. They found his weapons, equipment, and clothes fully intact. But the song can have so many different interpretations. I have found myself to be a `Stranger' in many places I've been.`Sea of Madness' is not bad, neither is `Heaven can Wait'. But the rest of the album has it's share of clunkers. I think that Steve Harris is the kind of writer who will pick a subject or topic to write about and instead of letting it go will force it instead to make it work. `Deja'vu' is possibly one of Maiden's weakest tracks ever, though it was a good idea. `The Lonliness of the Long Distance Runner' is another example of a forced idea. Maybe a U.S. Marine or marathon runner has a special connection with that song, but for most of Iron Maiden's fans, the song is not something we can relate to.Lastly we have `Alexander the Great' it is far too obvious that Maiden was going back to the well for another `Rime of the Ancient Mariner' from Powerslave. Alexander doesn't work though. It's a rambling account of ancient battles and cities. Forcing rhymes like Mesopotamia and Alexandria and squeezing as much as they can into this musical biography is just to much pushing and not enough flowing.Not recommended for the first time Iron Maiden buyer. For a first album I would suggest `Live after Death'. That album should have done for Maiden what ALIVE! Did for KISS. It was their greatest moment as they were at the height of the creativity.\n", "val": 5.866956780664623e-05}
{"text": "This follow-up to the sublime Powerslave is rather weak. Part of the problem is the new sound they are using. The compositions themselves are obviously in the tradition of Iron Maiden but they come off sounding very flat compared to other Maiden discs. Sounds more like prog rock than straight heavy metal.The best part of this disc is the superb lead guitar work by Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. They really play with a lot of feel. The solos are fast in the tradition of good metal but also melodic.The worst part of the disc is Bruce's vocals and some of the lyrics. Bruce is trying to sound operatic on some of the songs and he is just not up to the task. Sometimes he sounds like a howling old lady.Some of the lyrics take a stab at being deep but come across as just silly - Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner being the main culprit. Alexander the Great was an attempt at doing another Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The Rime, adapted from Samual Taylor Coleridge (sp?), is a piece of epic metal genius. Alexander the Great sounds like Bruce is reading the lyrics out of a high school text book on European History. Simply foolish.To sum up, the approach here is obviously similar to Powerslave but the results do not even compare. Somewhere in Time is one of Maiden's weakest.\n", "val": 0.00012526431237347424}
{"text": "Somewhere In Time sounds very much a product of the era in which it was made.  That's not necessarily always a bad thing.  But, we saw the [sad] trends that invaded the metal community in '86, such as Priest's \"Turbo\" and UFO's \"Misdemeanor.\"  Luckily, Maiden did not bow to the \"public tastes\" nearly as much here as on the aforementioned failed experiments.  However, Somewhere In Time definitely has lost a considerable amount of wholup when compared to Piece Of Mind and Powerslave.  The first signs of a band on auto-pilot show up here on the tunes Heaven Can Wait,  with a melody that tries way too hard and turns out being annoying (though the vocal chant is fun), and the plain yawner Deja Vu.  However, much of the rest is trademark Maiden, albeit with a few synths and a more commercial sound than before.  Even catchy lead single Wasted Years sounds like it was meant as a hit, while the hardest track, Sea of Madness, has a radio friendly solo break spliting it down the middle.  Alexander the Great revisits past history lessons with mixed results, the song being complex enough even if the ly-rucks are a bit half baked.  Somewhere In Time will be forever tied to spandex and big hair (thankfully Maiden avoided the hair thing).  Even Eddie looks a too tech. But the album art is cool and contains a bunch of references to Maiden's previous work.  Overall, Somewhere doesn't go much of anywhere... but does a better job doing it than most of the releases from this time from England's metal elite.\n", "val": 0.00018752967298496515}

{"text": "Iron Maiden's \"Somewhere In Time\", is their first recording to feature the extensive use of synthesized guitars, marking a significant point in the evolution of Maiden's signature sound.  While the \"softer\" synthesized sound does not have the hard edge found on their earlier recordings, the band was still capable of producing music with a punch.  Guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray were experimenting with new equipment and sounds, producing music that vocalist Bruce Dickinson once characterized as \"cosmic jazz\".  While Maiden's music may never quite fall into the jazz category, there was no doubt that the band was taking their music in a new direction.  The sound could perhaps be described as \"spacey\".  In the new aural environment, Steve Harris's bass may not seem as edgy as on previous albums, and to a certain extent, Nicko McBrain's drums are also absorbed in the mix.  Murray's trebly solo sound also does not stand out as much, and it is heard less, as Adrian Smith asserts himself.Reflecting a change in the band's attitude, the lyrics do not delve deeply into evil and the dark side.  The music might even be called optimistic, especially following the somewhat dark tone of \"Powerslave\".  Produced once again by Martin Birch, there are some great songs on this album, beginning with \"Caught Somewhere in Time\", a masterpiece that features creative songwriting, signature changes, soaring solos, energetic drumming, and some menacing vocals.Adrian Smith's \"Wasted Years\", is the closest thing to a single, and its retrospective theme, alludes to the maturity of the band members.  The song structure, like most of the songs on the album, is a departure from their previous efforts.  The solo is all Adrian, and it flows smoothly like a fine wine.\"Deja Vu\" is the album's most energetic tune, and rocks from start to finish.  The inspired interplay and harmony section in the solo break is very compelling, and may be what \"cosmic jazz\" is all about.Harris's \"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" builds in layers, and then approaches the classic \"galloping\" Maiden sound.  More tasty, spacey guitar, and silky smooth harmony passages.Smith's \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", based on the adventures of an arctic traveler, is an extremely cool sounding tune, with a steady pulsing bass line.  Adrian steps up again, and delivers a powerful, tension filled solo.The thought provoking \"Heaven Can Wait\", further shows the band's maturity with an interesting look at near death experience.  Murray has the first solo, and Smith the second.  In between is a sing along section that makes this song a concert favorite.\"Sea of Madness\" may be the most ambiguous song lyrically.  Yet it has almost a cheerful tone while delivering a message of despair.  Like other songs on this album written by Smith, this one features just his guitar solo.It seems that no Maiden release is complete without a Steve Harris epic as the finale, and so we have \"Alexander the Great\", a song that despite it's length is still very tight musically.  Dickinson does a good job with some tricky lyrics, and there is more tasteful \"cosmic\" guitar work by Murray and Smith.Iron Maiden's experimentation with this particular sound would continue on their next album, \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\".  How much regard fans have for these particular releases is an interesting question.  They do however, mark a significant phase in the evolution of the band.  \"Somewhere In Time\" is among the band's most progressive and enjoyable releases.\n", "val": 0.022417929023504257}

{"text": "It always bothers me when people put this album down just because the band decided to use guitar synthesizers. That dosen't mean they sold out or weren't \"metal\" anymore. In fact, other than Piece Of Mind this album and Seventh Son, which both feature guitar synthesizers, are my two favorites and were the bands most popular albums. It goes to show you that change isn't always a bad thing. Anyways, this is really the album where the guitar playing shines throughout. Seventh Son had its many moments, but this album has SUPERB playing throughout. Lyrically it is also very introspective, with great lyrics in songs like Sea Of Madness and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. On the latter song Bruce vividly describes what an athlete, like myslef, goes through when running a race. It is truly brilliant. Now, a song by song review. Caught Somewhere In Time- Great way to start the album with that memorable opening riff. The chorus will be caught in your mind for a long, long time. Great synth work especially. 5/5 Wasted Years- Maybe their biggest hit besides Run To The Hills. Fun chorus, good light tempo song sandwich's between two darker ones. 5/5 Sea Of Madness- Lyrically beautiful, great chorus and a very dark atmosphere. Hardest one here uses least synth. 4.5/5 Heaven Can Wait- Very similar to Wasted Years in that its a more up-beat song. Catchy guitar solo with fun sing-a-long chorus. Good, long instrumental section as well. Lyrics have a  very feel-good tone. 4.5/5 The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner- The most moving song here, really takes into what its like to run a race if you never have before, or even just competing against someone for something. Another cathcy guitar riff in the beginning, then it explodes into a fast, hard song until the chorus which is sung beautifully. 5/5 Stranger In A Strange Land- Slow and very melodic with a great opening riff. The problem is that it gets kind of repetitive and overkills the chorus. Nice solos too. 4.5/5 De Ja Vu- Good lyrics, even better use of synth here really enhances the song. On BNW, Dream of Mirrors also has to do with the de ja vu thing, but this song is better, albeit less complex. 4/5 Alexander The Great- You've probably heard stuff about how this is Maiden's best song or whatever, but let me be the first to tell you that it isn't THAT great. It is very good, but I think that Bruce sings too fast and you don't always pick up on what he's saying, which is a shame because the lyrics really cool and tell about the amazing life of Alexander The Great. The music is played very tight here, making it almost sound like one instrument that's playing. Great musicianship. 4.5/5 Somewhere In Time is definetly synth-metal at its best. Pick this and Seventh Son up as soon as you can.\n", "val": 0.01425529271364212}
{"text": "Maiden was big in the 80s.  \"Live After Death\" became their best live effort to date and the band's going strong in what is now considered their \"classic\" line-up.  With brand new guitar synthesizers out in 1986, the band decided to experiment with them and bring about a slightly more progressed but musically sophisticated album.This and \"Powerslave\" were the albums that got me hooked to Maiden and this one forever remains my favorite.  It may not be their best (many labeled \"Seventh Son\" or \"Number of the Beast\"), but it has a lot of good material that should not be forgotten.Caught Somewhere in Time - a GREAT OPENING track.  Almost an epic but a solid rocker as well.  Solid instrumentation.  The chorus is infectious as well, even if it is redundant somewhat.Wasted Years - My ALL TIME FAVORITE SONG FROM THIS BAND.  Adrian Smith is a musical genius and you can see why Smith's leaving hurt the band.  Great instrumentation, vocals, everything.  The guitar synth really adds to this.Sea of Madness - Probably the weakest on the album, but still great by all means.Heaven Can Wait - The synth boosts this one up quite well.  The chorus pulls itself off in a minor way but becomes a great chorus anyways.  I really like the bassline in this one.Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner - An epic-toned song.  Pretty good song.  Doesn't really stand on its own quite as well as the others, but this is still noteworthy Maiden.Stranger in a Stranger Land - Great song.  A Maiden classic!  The guitarwork is extroadinary.  The synthesized background provides a great backdrop for this tale.Deja Vu - Largely underrated by fans, this one of the first songs to get me hooked into this great metal band.  The lyrics are just astounding and the solo trade-off is just brilliant.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR FIRST-TIME MAIDEN LISTENERS TO GIVE THIS SONG A SHOT.Alexander the Great - An 8-minute epic about the great conqueror.  The guitarwork and vocals are simply brilliant here and I'm saddened that they don't play this one live (Steve Harris said in an interview that \"Adrian Smith forgot how to play it,\" or something along those lines.  Whatever the case may be, this song is too brilliant to be ignored in a live setting).  I wouldn't compare this to Rime of the Ancient Mariner; both are simply brilliant.Overall, I highly recommend any metalhead to give this one a shot.  Many were put off by its progressive sound and the fact that they used synthesizers (GUITAR synthesizers), but that just shows ignorance.

Plus the song \"Alexander The Great\" can get you through a history report like it did me.\n", "val": 0.025364859029650688}
{"text": "This is the most complete Maiden album ever!  Every song could appear on a \"Best Of\" album of theirs (which makes me wonder why they don't...) because each song is so full of melody, epic grandeur, and complex musicianship.  Many of Iron Maiden's fans that have been around since the beginning usually mark Powerslave as their last great album, but that's just foolish.  Somewhere In Time is their best album, followed by 7th Son of a 7th Son.  Here is how i rate every song:Caught Somewhere In Time - excellent, fast opening track with lots of synths! 10/10Wasted Years - melodic, beautiful, great solo, great chorus 9.5/10Sea Of Madness - one of Maiden's heaviest tracks! 9/10Heaven Can Wait - this is such a fun song, I can't help but smile everytime I hear it 9.5/10The Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner - if it weren't for the cheesey lyrics, this song would go down as one of their best ever, but otherwise, it's still a great song 9/10Deja Vu - very interesting lyrics and a slower paced song then the rest of the album...excellent, one of the best! 10/10Stranger In A Strange Land - best song on the album! just listen to that solo!! 10/10Alexander The Great - epic, epic, epic! not only do you get a fantastic epic song, but you also get a history lesson in just 8 minutes! 10/10There you have it, Maiden's finest hour\n", "val": 0.02581370808184147}
{"text": "Somewhere in Time is a riveting 8 track album that should not be missed by any Maiden fan. The album is even better when you consider that it was written after their huge World Slavery Tour which took a lot of energy from the band. Nevertheless, it is still gold. This album invalidates anyone who says that all Maiden's music sounds the same. This is because they've added synth bass and synth guitar. It is very noticable in the first and title track, Caught Somewhere in Time. The multimedia video of the second song, Wasted Years, recaps all of Maiden's achievements up to point of Somewhere in Time. There are quick shots of their first major performance at the Rainbow when they had put out a mere 2 albums, and of the World Slavery Tour. The third song entitled Sea of Madness is a power-packed action-driven song with plenty of drum work by Nicko. The fourth track is the favorite at Maiden shows which represents Somewhere in Time. I speak, of course, of Heaven Can Wait. The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner describes a runner in a cross country race. Stranger in a Strange Land (just the title) is inspired by the book of the same name. The multimedia video of that is live and it allows one to see the elaborate set of a Maiden concert. Deja Vu is my personal favorite for this album. Nicko puts in some great hi-hat work and it has a wonderfully sung chorus.Alexander the Great caps off the album. The lyrics write the tale of Alexander the Great and his fascinating life. One is reminded of the Egyptian theme from Maiden's previous studio album, Powerslave, with its Egyptian sounding tunes. All in all, Somewhere in Time is a profound and terrific album that is, in two words, \"A Masterpiece\".\n", "val": 0.01875573955476284}

{"text": "Iron Maiden is not a underrated band but they have several albums that are, sadly. Somewhere In Time is one of those said albums. I think a lot of people were turned off by the use of synthesizers and the very epic feel of all the songs but they can stop whining and just continue to miss of the all time great albums that this has become. As the title and cover art would suggest, the album has a very futuristic feel and it has a very spacey feel. Sadly, Maiden has forgotten about these songs live wise but that's what albums are for :) This is your classic maiden that you will find on Powerslave or Piece Of Mind and contains the same scorching riffs but everything has a slicked up futurisitc feel to it. I can't explain it well, you'll just have to listen to it.Several songs on here are the best that Maiden have written and those are: Alexander The Great, Sea oF Madness, and The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner. The latter is one of my favorite all time songs.In short, Iron Maiden is a band full of awesome albums for you to listen to and enjoy but I highly, highly, suggest this one.UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n", "val": 0.032253704965114594}
{"text": "Out of all the Maiden albums this is the most melodic with some really beautiful riffs, great songs which just plain rock and an album which was undoubtedly the finest hour for guitarist Adrian Smith(guitar god).Sadly however this album rarely gets a mention and is completely overlooked on Maidens latest live set, I will concede that this album is the most 80s like but I think class of this magnitude is timeless.  Songs from this album could vastly benefit Maiden's live set as they unbelievably still include songs like Sanctuary and Wrathchild which sound awful with Dickinson's voice, could you imagine Paul Di'Anno trying to sing Aces High or Flight of Icarus, please don't even try, hint hint Bruce!CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIMEQuality opener, a song with a great drive and a good chorus which you'll be singing in no time.  The great drive in the song is the sort of thing that would have you unknowingly speeding if driving.  A great solo from Adrian that reaches for the stars in middle and great vocals from Dickinson throughout.WASTED YEARS(Sings) So understandThis was Maiden's attempt to go Mainstream searching for thoseradio years.Ok this isn't my favourite song on the album because it's sounds like such a direct attempt for Maiden to get with the mainstream, tut tut.  What I love about Maiden is you don't see them on t.v and the Joe public is completely oblivious to them stuck in a world a mindless catchy, substanceless pop.  I shudder to think what would've happened if Maiden went mainstream.  All in all it's performed well with Nicko pulling off some unreal drumming patterns, a nice opening riff and good lyrics but it's not groundbreaking and it's far too soft, ohh Maiden, what were you thinking?SEA OF MADNESSNow this is more like it, a darker tune with some heavy guitars which symbolise the madness theme and some strong bass to match.Again the lyrics are top notch but the real high point is in the middle when the song bursts away from the darkness into some beautiful melodies followed by bass lines from Steve to die for, magic, love Bruce's little ooooh, ooooh,ooooh during this part, he soars for the high notes.HEAVEN CAN'T WAITThis ones a mixed bag in that it's soft song and all in all quite a forgettable tune.  However the famous sing-along in the middle is unbelievable and turns a mediocre song into a great one, this should be on the live set all the time.THE LONELINESS OF A LONG DISTANCE RUNNERWow. Best song on the album and one of Maidens all time classics.  The riff is one of the best of all time, the lyrics brilliantly sum up the thinking of a sportsman (I use it to motivate myself) and the drive runs along like the runner.  The explosion in the middle is a masterstroke, kind of a pure victory riff, it's just magic.  You'll love it if you any kind of sportsman, even if your not.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LANDThis song has a great feel to it, really captures the emotion of the lyrics.  This is Dickinson's best performance on the album not to mention the solo in the middle, OH MY GOD!The lyrics are top quality as always from Adrian Smith and this is his best ever song.DE JA VUDave and Adrian team up and create this little gem that is easily the most forgotten song on the album.  A great fast number with fantastic drumming from Nicko and great lyrics, love 'cause you know this has happened before' great energy and emotion from Dickinson. The lyrics possibly touch on having lived before, classic Maiden type subject make this a great song.ALEXANDER THE GREAT (356-323 B.C)The classic Maiden epic album closer, the lyrics fit perfectly with the historical theme. A very grandiose drive/riff which suits it's theme perfectly fitting great drama, action, tragedy and victory on to one song, brilliant.\n", "val": 0.0023423018865287304}
{"text": "I remember hearing this album for the first time on a record. Man did that record sound like crud, but I still loved the songs anyway. This Iron Maiden album is more mellow than earlier releases, but surpasses Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, and Powerslave in overall consistent song quality.Caught Somewhere In Time: Not that good and certainly not that bad. I think it deserves a B and eases you into the better songs that are to come later.Wasted Years: This song has a positive message and in general is a very good song. The vocal hook is something you can sing along with. Musically it may not be one of the most impressive but still it deserve a solid B+. \"Stand up and face your fears. Realize you're living in the golden years.\" (Quote may not be entirely accurate)Sea of Madness: Well, it sure has a memorable guitar riff but damn I can't remember the lyrics without cheating and looking. That has to say something about a song. That doesn't make it awful or anything, but much like Caught Somewhere In Time this is one of the weaker songs on the album and that is not that weak at all. B.Heaven Can Wait: I really love the sound of this song and it really kicks but many the whole band gets involved with background vocal and \"Heaven Can Wait. Heaven Wait For Another Day\" kicks in. This is a very strong song, but not quite blowing up my \"skirt\". B+.Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner: Man, what a weird song. It has one of the best Maiden guitar riff beginnings and then kicks in a very fast-paced vocal flavor from Bruce. I guess they were trying to create the running/speed feel to the song. The tune really captures you and almost makes you feel like you could be the one pushing for the finish. Another not quite A song, but a B+. Very good song, but nothing amazing.Stranger In A Strange Land: What a song this one is. It really reminds me of somebody who has just become completely jaded and sick of the way the world works. Perhaps not an inspiring song but a great one. A.De Ja Vu: This is probably the weakest song on the album, but is not horrible at all. It doesn't even come close to being as bad as Acacia Avenue or Gangland on Number of the Beast. You guessed it. It is about De Ja Vu. B-.Alexander The Great: This is another awe inspiring Maiden epic. Again, like Hallowed Be Thy Name from Number of the Beast and Rime of the Ancient Mariner from Powerslave, this song is one explosively long and \"lovely\" piece of metal. Hey, and according to my history teacher brother, it is historically accurate. So if you are a history student or history buff, don't watch the History Channel or read a book. Listen to Iron Maiden's synopsis of the life of Alexander the Great. A++\n", "val": 0.015936806797981262}
{"text": "It was like a scene from The Breakfast Club. Four 10th graders exiled by the band director to a tiny practice room every day during second period. Ostensibly we were in there to practice our instruments, but most days nary a note was blown or plucked. Instead, we formed a circle with our folding chairs and traded idle chatter and vicious barbs. For those of you requiring a cast of characters, the room contained Kurt (a preppy French-horn-playing jerk typically clad in an oxford shirt, pleated slacks and penny loafers), Kim (a redneck trumpeter chick with a don't-mess-with-me attitude who grew up just down the street from me in York Terrace), Tim (an unpretentious friendly violinist who worked long hours after school at a local seafood restaurant), and me (a mediocre saxophonist with a jones for classic rock and a small circle of close friends who thought band was for stoners and delinquents).Our second period experience usually began with Kurt insulting one, two, or even all three of us. Some of the things Kurt most enjoyed poking fun at included my questionable writing skills, Tim's fondness for flannel shirts, and Kim's overall scholastic prowess. Considering the rate at which Kurt doled out insults, it was a wonder that he didn't emerge from our cell bruised and battered one day. Luckily for him, the only person in that room who possessed any violent tendencies was Kim and only she knows why she didn't act on them. It's not like Tim or I would have intervened - plump little Kurt wouldn't have stood a chance against an angry (and generously proportioned) Terrace girl like Kim.Tim was into heavy metal, a musical genre Kurt considered pathetic. The way Kurt saw it, 'why would anyone play corny Iron Maiden when they could play music by cool acts like the Thompson Twins or Corey Hart?' He certainly never shied away from heavy-handedly offering his views on the subject to Tim. Whenever Tim started raving about Maiden or their mascot, Eddie, Kurt would roll his eyes and hurl another insult at him. There wasn't much I could say to come to Tim's defense since I was completely unfamiliar with Iron Maiden myself at the time. Over the course of the year, Tim made plenty of offers to play some Maiden for me, but preferring to avoid giving Kurt another excuse to insult me, I never took him up on it. By the time the school year ended, we all reviled Kurt and had no desire to continue interacting with him in the future. Oddly enough, none of the rest of us hung out anymore either - perhaps because we all associated each other with Kurt.With the appearance of Appetite for Destruction the next year, I became a huge metal fan myself and over the ensuing years amassed a formidable collection of metal albums. However, for many years, there was always something missing from my collection. Perhaps it was all the ribbing I'd heard Kurt give Tim, but something always inhibited me from checking out Iron Maiden. Finally in 1999, after hearing a series of Maiden classics on WSOU, Seton Hall's Pirate Radio, I could hold out no longer. I picked up Powerslave and Somewhere in Time in short order and got to work. And what pleasant work it was. It was like discovering a treasure trove I never knew existed. Maiden infused their music with so much energy - Bruce Dickinson's impassioned multi-octave vocals, the incomparable Smith-Murray guitar duels, Nicko McBrain's rock solid drumming, and Steve Harris' chugga chugga bass lines. I dare say heavy metal has never been so melodic before or since. I found both Powerslave and Somewhere in Time to be very good albums, but lyrically Somewhere in Time was far more appealing to me than the war and violence themed Powerslave. Plus, Somewhere in Time had more epic cuts like the veritable history lesson, \"Alexander the Great\", the inspirational anthem, \"Wasted Years\", the slow-building \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\", and the twin guitar classics, \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" and \"De Ja Vu\". If you love heavy metal, I am almost certain you will find cuts on Somewhere in Time that will blow you away. Of course, Maiden does have a reputation for including a few less than stellar cuts on many of their albums and Somewhere in Time is no exception. However, if you are reasonably competent at operating a fast-forward button, you will not be disappointed with the overall power and majesty of Somewhere in Time. I can almost assure you that you will like it better than a Corey Hart album from the same era.\n", "val": 8.336520113516599e-05}

{"text": "Here it is folks. \"Somewhere in Time\". The finest album produced by Iron Maiden in my opinion, with \"Piece of Mind\" a close second. This is not only my favorite Maiden album but along with Metallica's \"Ride the Lightning\", it's my favorite Heavy Metal album ever. It's purely genius musicians working at their highest level of creativity and talent. It was definitely a change from anything they had done previously. They now had the money to experiment in the studio, and that they did. It's a very effects driven album, but no other album or band has used \"effects\" in a better way or style than right here. It's possibly their darkest, moodiest, and clearly the most progessive sounding album they've done, filled with time changes, mood changes, and great long, fast and slow solo's from the best. This album features the songwriting ability and talent of Adrian Smith, as the acrobatic fingers of Dave Murray, and his fast signature solo's take somewhat of a back seat. It's very melodic, moody, and still fast. It's the first Maiden album I listened to, and I probably don't recommend lisdtening to this first, if you're new or looking to get into Maiden. I would recommend starting with \"Number of the Beast\" or \"Powerslave\". It took me a few listens to finally appreciate the genius behind the creation of this fine pice of Heave Metal History. The album begins with the classic dual guitar sound in the intro of \"Caught somewhere in Time\". A long, fast, and fabulous intro to the album. Two long and great back to back solo's from Murray and Smith. The next song \"Wasted Years\" is one of their biggest hits ever, and really made here in America. Great catchy chorus, and great solo. One of my personal favorites from the band. The next song is one of the meanest riffs and vocals ever performed from the band. Great fast song, and great time change in the middle slowing down the pace after the fabulous solo from Adrian Smith. The next song \"Heaven Can Wait\" is a classic long epic from Steve harris, bassist and main songwriter. It also remained in their live set for years to come. The middle of the song between the two solo's is the highlight of the song, a great anthem during live shows meant for the crowd to sing along. \"The loneliness of the long distance runner\" is next, and features another great, cool, intro. A solid song, but the following song, another single and hit, \"Stranger in a strange land\" is one of the best on the album. It's a slower song, but features a fantastic moving solo from Adrian Smith which begins slowly and then heats up into a great jam that continues through the end of the song. \"De Javu\" is next, not the best song on the album, but the finale \"Alexander the Great\" is not just the best off the album, but possible my personal favorite song from Maiden. A great intro, which begins with \"Philip of Macedon\" giving his kingdom over to his son Alexander. The song is a narrative of his life and conquests, and you can really invision him leading his troops into battle throughout the intro. Among the best long, epic, thematic songs that typically close Maiden albums. This is by far Iron Maiden at their finest hour. Plain and simple. Every song is superb.

I know that many people say that it is too futuristic for maiden and uses keyboards but i say that this is a good thing. The keyboards really provide a new level of texture and ambience to the music. Just because its progressive does not mean that its not heavy. It just means that they tried to be more melodic. And I think they succeeded. The guitar work is fantastic. Adrian and Dave really are the two most compatible guitarists in heavy metal. Each solo is emotional and melodic(my favorite is the solo on stranger in a stranger land.

{"text": "This is my favourite Iron Maiden album tied with Number Of The Beast. This showcases a very mature and more progressive Iron Maiden, which was certainly a big change in direction. The synths were pretty controversial at the time, but I think they work brilliantly. Somewhere In Time, despite being recorded in the 80s (and sounding like it), has a very spacey, futuristic feel to it.The music is well structured, the melodies are great and the lyrics are well thought out (compared to most metal bands at the time). Tracks like Caught Somewhere In Time and The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner are amazing..., they're all great! The only thing I regret about buying this album is that I didn't buy it sooner.This is a great album. I don't care who said it was ... (one person even said that it was as bad as \"No Prayer For The Dying\"). I love this album, and when I first got it it refreshed my love for Maiden's music where even Piece Of Mind didn't when I bought that a few months before. This album shows a real sense of maturity and progression. Don't get me wrong, I like thier older stuff as well, but many bands have either produced a string of albums that sound exactly alike or they've changed for the worse. However, just when Maiden thought that they couldn't top Powerslave, they release this - and it doesn't just sound like an improved version of Powerslave! It's probably Maiden's most most unique album in terms of its sound. Fantastic.\n", "val": 0.03388812765479088}
{"text": "First Iron Maiden CD I ever bought.  I was told to buy Powerslave and I listened to a demo of Powerslave at the store.  I thought it was allright, but then I picked up Somewhere In Time for curiosity, and fell in love with what I heard so I bought it instead.  Powerslave is an excellent CD, I eventually bought it and I'm listening to Flash of the Blade as I write this.  Title track to this album is actually my favorite.  Love the intro and the riff.  The solo in this song deserves more credit though.  This has complete virtuoso style guitaring in the solo, and should be ranked with NOTB's solo, and solos of other songs, such as Metallica's One & Fade to Black, Pantera's Cemetery Gates, Ozzy's Mr. Crowley just to name a few.  Title track goes to show that Dave Murray and Adrian Smith are complete virtuosos.  Wasted Years another great track that opens up your eyes to your own life.  Sea of Madness has a great riff and a great chorus.  Very heavy actually.  Heaven Can Wait is soft, but very powerful and memorable and good to listen to.  Long Distance Runner is one of my favorites.  Again, another virtuoso style masterpiece.  Excellent guitaring.  Music done 100%.  A perfect epic.  Stranger In A Strange Land is a very good song drenched with a good chorus and riff.  Deja Vu is my second favorite besides title track.  The riff, the vocals, the power, the emotion.  It sends chills down your spine.  The keyboards, however awkward, are put to great use and sound perfect.  Deja Vu is a tremendously great song.  Alexander the Great is a song that shows Iron Maiden are great story tellers.  Its an epic masterpiece and just shows the irony of history.  This CD is worth every penny.  And if you are automatically turned off by learning that keyboards are used in this CD, give it a chance.  10:1 says youll enjoy it if you are a real Maiden fan.  They may use keyboards, but they know how to use them good.  Worth every penny.  Buy it if you can.\n", "val": 0.045378681272268295}

{"text": "Somewhere in time is a brilliant follow up album to 'Powerslave'. By creating Powerslave, Maiden had reached the peak of its blistering metal creativity.With somewhere in time, they added a synth sound to the band (guitar synth), and the effect on their music is dramatic.This album  covers a wide spectrum with chainsaw metal tracks like 'caught somewhere in time', 'wasted years', 'sea of madness', and reveals its melancholy moments with tracks like 'stranger in a strange land'. Adrian Smith stamps his influence on many compositions coming up with brilliant leads, and riffs that keep the listener glued. Probably, Alexander the great is a slightly grandiose offering, but nevertheless, the smith-murray combination creates a beautiful aural landscape that is almost operatic. Perhaps the one thing that stops this album from achieving a 5 star rating is its production value. This was probably Maiden's most expensively produced album at that point in time, and it has a finely polished feel to it. The rough edge of Powerslave is missing, but nevertheless its a magnificent record.Buy this album.\n", "val": 0.02059328369796276}

{"text": "I've been a Maiden fan since I was 12. My first Maiden album was \"Killers\". I loved P. Di'anno, and the music Maiden produced before B. Dickinson joined Maiden.....I loved Number Of The Beast, Piece Of Mind, and Powerslave. I was very excited when Somewhere In Time was released, however it wasn't what I expected....It was much more than anything I could have ever wished for!This is pure genius. It's without a doubt one of the best Iron Maiden has ever released. Some would say it's too slow, or too fast, or maybe even too progressive....I'll tell you one thing, it's too good to be true. This was an area Iron Maiden had never dared to tread before, and not many Heavy Metal bands ever do. Iron Maiden made a change. It was a change not many of us Maiden loyalists were comfortable with at first, but later realized the true perfection this really is, and holds in the Iron Maiden halls of history....Every single time I listen to this, it takes me back in time. This release is full of all of the great things Iron Maiden stands for.My All-Time favorite Maiden releases are as such....1.) Number Of The Beast - This was over the top in 1982. Contains the classics \"Children Of The Damned\", \"Prisoner\", \"22 Acacia Avenue\", \"Run To The Hills\", and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". The most explosive Iron Maiden effort in my opinion....2.) Piece Of Mind - After this was released, Iron Maiden had finally reached the status of Heavy Metal Gods. This contains the classics \"Where Eagles Dare\", \"Revelations\", \"Still Life\", \"Flight Of Icarus\", \"Die With Your Boots On\", \"The Trooper\", and my personal favorite \"To Tame A Land\". Clearly a classic release in Metal History.3.) Powerslave - This was a monster release. Along with Number Of The Beast, and Piece Of Mind, this became the best three Heavy Metal albums you could listen too in 1985. One after another, Maiden never disappointed. Contains classics \"Aces High\", \"2 Minutes To Midnight\", \"Powerslave\", \"Flash Of The Blade\", and \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\". Simply incredible!4.) Somewhere In Time - Very different, but at the same time, a very good fresh breath of air. This release blew me away. It had a totally different sound than previous releases, but at the same time, still contained that true Maidenistic power and melody I always loved. When you listen to this, you almost feel like you've been passed through a time warp.....\"Somewhere In Time\" could not have been a better title for this one. Contains classics \"Somewhere In Time\", \"Sea Of Madness\", \"Stranger In A Strange Land\", \"Deja Vu\", \"Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\", \"Heaven Can Wait\", and \"Alexander The Great\". Calling this a diamond in the rough is an understatment. It's pure genius.5.) Killers/Seventh Son - I love Killers. They never released an album that sounded like this ever again. Almost a spookie feel to it, one that leaves a very lasting impression.....Killers rules!Seventh Son - A really interesting album. Takes over where \"Somewhere In Time\" left off....More great classics like \"Moonchild\", \"Infinite Dreams\", \"Seventh Son\" and \"Can I Play With Madness\" make this another Maiden diamond in the rough.Over the years, Iron Maiden have remained loyal to their roots, and at the same time, have also expanded their limits by leaps and bounds.If there was ever a manshion inside Heavy Metal Heaven, it would have many halls, among those halls would dwell the greatest Heavy Metal bands of All-Time.On the throne,...Iron Maiden would rule!!UP THE IRONS!\n", "val": 0.052164409309625626}
{"text": "'Somewhere In Time' was my first taste of Iron Maiden. After hearing one of my friends rave about this band I've never really heard, I decided to buy an album and see for myself. At that time, I was very disillusioned with much of the metal I have been hearing. It was the time when dumb ass bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit were taking over for greats such as Metallica; and it was at this time that I was searching for a great metal band.I don't know why I chose to pick up 'Somewhere In Time', but I do know that what I heard was one of the most original and fantastic metal recordings I have ever had the honor of listening to. This band was the holy grail I have been searching for! At that time, though, I found out that Bruce was doing his own solo thing and that Maiden had just recorded their second with Bailey.'Somewhere In Time' made me a Maiden fan after one spin of the CD. If you have never heard any Iron Maiden, I would recommend this to be the intro CD to the band...it is one of their middle recordings, so there are many previous and post records available.What really caught my attention were the beautifully crafted metal pieces. Songs such as 'Caught Somewhere In Time', 'Wasted Years', 'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner', 'Stranger In a Strange Land', and 'Alexander the Great' kept me captivated and drove me to buy every single Iron Maiden album (except for the yet-unreleased 'Brave New World') within a span of two months- speaking of overkill!The only weak songs on the album are 'De Ja Vu' and 'Heaven Can Wait', though they are still great songs. And if you look closely at the cover art, you can spot symbolical clues to their previous albums...take for instance the pyramid in the back (powerslave), or the aces high bar (powerslave), or the phantom opera house (iron maiden), or the ancient mariner seafood restaurant (powerslave)...the list goes on and on...This will forever be one of my special albums...because it introduced me to one of the greatest bands, and because it filled a heavy metal void within my soul...\n", "val": 0.010238831862807274}
{"text": "This album reveals alot of change. First of all Iron Maiden now introduces synthesizers!!! That was not something you heard every day on your average metal album at the time, and some fans strongly disaproved. The sound changed too, fitting the sci-fi theme of the Cd. I still see this Cd as one of their better, the change seems refreshing and you can still recognize the Maiden fingerprints on most of the songs. Caught Somewhere in Time is a brilliant introduction to this cd, starting off to show us a new sound. The songs in some way seem more serious than on previous albums(noone in their right state of mind can take a song like Number of the Beast serious), and again it also touches spiritual aspects(De Ja Vu), and once again Harris dabbles in history on Alexander the Great. This album is a great example of how diverse Iron Maiden can be when they put their mind up to it.\n", "val": 0.03008565865457058}
{"text": "Back in 1984 Maiden released their best album, the immortal \" Powerslave \" They set a really high standard for themselves. While they didn't top \" Powerslave \" they still made this classic album. This album still tends to get underrated because of the synths. Their not really noticed here as much as in \" 7th Son \" They do nothing to hurt the songs, but they don't really do much to help them. You got to admire them for trying out new stuff though. Anyway here's my grades.  Song Grades1. Caught Somewhere In Time-classic title track and opener like \" Where Eagles Dare \" It's one of Maidens epics. It's got the famous synth beginning and a pretty anthemic chorus. The amazing thing is that's its only the third best epic on this album.  Final Grade-B+2. Wasted Years-While it's not in the Top 10 Maiden songs this is still one of the best mainstream hard-rock songs I have ever heard. It's like the song a band like Aerosmith have been trying to write all their lives, but couldn't. It's got the same subject matter of life on the road as  Metallica's \" Wherever I May Roam \"  Final Grade-A-3. Sea Of Madness-It's an underated Maiden tune and the hardest rocking song on this album. The lyrics could possibly be dealing with Noah's Ark  Final Grade-B+4. Heaven Can Wait-This another Maiden epic and the 2nd best song on the album. While the chorus is only OK, I really like the singing in the verses.  Final Grade-A-5. The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner-Perhaps the longest Maiden-song title. The beginning is one of the most memorable intro's I have ever heard but after that it kind of tails off. It's still a good song.  Final Grade-B6. Stranger In A Strange Land-It's a good catchy hard-rocking song and was the 2nd single off this album, but it still feels like a made-to-be-played on radio song. It's not as good of a single as \" Wasted Years \"  Final Grade-B7. Deja-Vu-Here comes the first misstep of this album. I don't know the point of this song being made. The chorus is annoying and the lyrics are kind of stupid. It's not even a guilty pleasure to listen to sometimes like \" Mother Russia \" It's just a mediocre song that I always skip over. Not as bad as \" Quest For Fire \" though.  Final Grade-D+8. Alexander The Great-The last epic and the best song on this album. It's an extremely well put together song like \" Rime Of The Ancient Mariner \" or \" Hallowed Be Thy Name \" The only thing keeping me from giving this song an A+ is that by 1986 it became kind of cliche for metal bands to sing about historical figures. I usually don't pay much attention to the lyrics but the song is extremely well song and the guitar solo is awesome. It's better that you just not look at the lyric sheet and just enjoy this song.  Final Grade-AThis and \" 7th Son \" are still Maiden in their prime, but after that it's all downhill till \" Brave New World \" I would recommend this album because most of the songs are classics, but especially for the 3 epics.\n", "val": 0.0005756591563113034}

I luv the mid part too when bruce stars harmonizing its awesome.Heaven Can Wait-and yes it can, an instant metal, maiden classic. Always playing this one live, they worked thr arse's off on this one. Dynamite solos and the Lyrics are just extraordinary.Loneliness of the long...-Great tune the beginning of the song rox, i luv how the chorus goes again and the ending of the song is cool too, when steve slaps the bass.Stranger in a Strangeland-Adrain struck again, luv the opening with bass and drums, and yes the guitar and bass solo is outstanding to listen too.Dejavu-the opening is awesome, dave's solos is spectacular, and once again the chorus is top notch, I luv how Bruce sings on this its so wicked sounding.Alexander the Great-wow they had to dig up some major history towrite this one, this is such an amazing maiden album. The way the lyrics go, the bass and drums are dynamite especially in the middle of the song, and the clicking of both the guitar solos are astonishing, awesome closing.This is no doubt another maiden classic, u think alot abt the future and the universe when u hear this the sounds are just amazing, well done maiden, get this album.

{"text": "This album is unlike many other Maiden albums (with the exception of Brave New world) due to the fact that the band got heavily experimental and for the first time tried to use synthesisers.  Was that a bad idea? Well I say no if you can produce an album as good as this!  What is interesting is the way that the songs have a sci-fi feel to them.  The opening song \"Caught somewhere in time\" sounds at the start like it has laser rifles firing all around!  What I like about this album is the time concept and how not being able to die can drive you mad.  For instance the song \"Deja Vu\" talks of how Eddie the time traveller has seen so many things so often he can no longer tell the difference between reality and fantasy.  Another thing that makes me admire this album is the song length, like Powerslave before it this album stretches out to fifty minutes in total, even though there are only 8 songs on it!  However these songs are seldom boring as they vary so much, \"Alexander the great\" can be fast enough to do some serious headbanging too and later be very calm and pick up again!  The only song on here that I am not really keen on is \"The loneliness of the long distance runner\", while it is a long ambitious song I feel that it suffers from repitition.  However seven out of eight songs means that roughly 94% of the album can be listened to over and over again.  Can bands like Papa Roach, Linkin park and Limp Bizkit say that on their albums?  No they can't!  Reason enough to buy it, not Maiden's best but certainly worth the price as this is another cd that will stay in your collection for many years to come.\n", "val": 0.0065050264820456505}

I never get bored with this album even though I have listened to it million times. It s always fresh, energetic and original as the first time.Starting from the fist song \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" till the last track of album \"Alexander the Great\" , Iron Maiden blows up your mind once more time just as they already did with their previous albums from \"Iron Maiden\" to \"Powerslave\". The main difference of this album from others is sythesizers, and which doesn t destroy their well-estabished metal sound.

{"text": "Generally a pretty good album. The reason being that all the tracks are quite good. The only reason why I don't rate it as one of Maidens best albums is because although I quite like all the tracks there are no superb ones appart from \"Wasted Years\" and \"Stranger In A Strange Land.\"For me,I rate albums such as \"Iron Maiden,The Number Of The Beast,and Seventh Son above this one.\"However,this is still quite a cool album.1CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME-My least favourite on the album. I find it doesnt have that much to it and drags on for a whole 7 minutes.2WASTED YEARS-Best on the album and one of Maidens best ever songs. The guitar solo in the middle is amazing.3SEA OF MADNESS-Cool start to this song. I find it fades a bit towards the middle but generally good.4HEAVEN CAN WAIT-I like this one,good tune and lyrics. Also been used live quite a lot.5THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANT RUNNER-Some people don't like this song but I think its quite cool,and also being a runner myself I appreciate it!6STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND-The next best on the album,partly for another immense guitar solo.7DEJA VU-This is okey but an anti-climax after the superb previous track.8ALEXANDER THE GREAT-The 2nd worst on the album,it has a reasnoble tune but gets boring after a whole 8 minutes worth.\n", "val": 0.010294022038578987}

{"text": "If you've seen my Wish List, you know that I've really been wanting this album.  Well, I now have it, and I am quite pleased.  My friend Chris said that this is Maiden's most underrated album, and I definitely agree.  Ah, 1986, what a year it was.  Reagan was in the White House, \"Top Gun\" was drawing in the big bucks in the box office, and some of metal's greatest bands were putting out one masterpiece after another.  Yes, there were many great albums that came out in that year (\"Master of Puppets\", \"Reign in Blood\", \"Among the Living\", \"Peace Sells...\"), but I believe that this album here beats them all.  This album just has a feel to it, I can't explain it.  I don't know if it's an \"80's feel\" or a \"futuristic feel\" or what, but it's just amazing.  Before you roll your eyes and call me stupid, I know it's because of the synth.  While many may have been turned off by it, I think it adds something.  I'm not sure what, but it does.  I love every song on here, but I think the one that stands out the most would have to be \"Wasted Years\".  This was one of the first Maiden songs I ever heard, and I instantly fell in love with it.  I knew this was a band that I had to know more about.  Bruce Dickinson's vocals shine more than ever on this one.  He may not be a very big guy (about 5'6\", around 140 pounds, I'd guess), but he has more power and emotion in his voice than a man twice his size.  Then, there's the music.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because this is a slightly slower, more melodic album than previous releases, it's any less technical.  The songs are all very long, and the music is as complex and dazzling as ever.  Dave Murray and Adrian Smith prove once again that they are two of the greatest guitarists on the planet, cranking out solos that Dave Mustaine couldn't do on his best day.  Steve Harris does a remarkable job of keeping up with the guitar (but not just following it, he's doing his own thing), and Nicko's drumming is at its peak.  Top that off with some really cool, thought provoking lyrics and an awesome album cover, and you've got what is simply one of the greatest albums ever made.  I think this album is way better than \"7th Son\" or \"Number of the Beast\" (although those are both great albums), and almost as good as \"Powerslave\" and \"Brave New World\".  The only complaint I could make about this album is that \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" and \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" get a bit repetitive on the choruses, but that's probably being too picky.  Everything else about the album is perfect.  I don't see how anyone can call themselves an Iron Maiden fan if they don't like this album.  It is truly a work of art.\n", "val": 0.043374888598918915}

While I enjoy \"Powerslave\" and \"Brave New World\" immensely, this particular review states that \"Somewhere...\" is the ultimate Maiden.Reasons being is that a few of these songs happen to be my all-time favorites of all time.\"Caught Somewhere in Time\" is a great song and this pulls out lots of electronic goodies.  Bruce Dickinson is great!\"Deja Vu\" is one of the hardcore guitar songs. Although featuring few vocals, this song goes ALL-OUT on the guitars. I especially liked the fast-paced guitar work and you can tell that Adrian Smith enjoyed this one to the fullest.\"Alexander the Great\" is an awesome song, if a bit overlong (especially the tiring 3-minute instrumental somewhere in the middle). My favorite part is the opening \"march\" after Alexander's father says his death words. Also, this is one of the historical rock songs, and it deserves high points.\"Strangers in a Strange Land\" has a darker feel than the rest of the songs, and it has a couple synthesized goodies here and there.And... quite possibly my all-time favorite song is \"Wasted Years.\" This is classic Maiden! A great song that is just perfect; it's not overlong and the instrumentals inbetween the lyrics are not overbearing or dull (like some other Maiden songs over the years). I love the chorus especially.The neat thing about this album is that (like Nicko McBrain with the \"Piece of Mind\" album) Adrian Smith is the real highlight of this album.

The synth guitars sound good, but I think you wouldn't want to hear them from a band like Maiden. The good points, however, are the songs themselves. There are many top hits. Everyone would agree on Wasted Years. Out of the other 7 songs everyone has his/her own favorites. My favorites are Stranger In A Strange Land (very emotional and powerful, great use of the synth guitar), Deja-Vu (amazing song that makes you jump all over... requires a few listens), and Alexander the Great (the same caliber of To Tame A Land).Overall its a great album which every Maiden fan MUST own.If you're not a Maiden fan first get the debut album, The Number Of The Beast and 7th Son.

Only because it's my favorite, from my favorite band, a band I've been freebasing since I was 11 years old.So, to you morons who slag off on this disc, here's what I say...1. Someone wrote that his album doesn't \"pack enough punch\".  Did they miss \"Sea of Madness\" and the title track?  Finding songs with more punch in the Maiden catalog is real, real hard.2. Someone complained that no Dickinson compositions are on here. He did write during this period, and you know what he wrote? \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" (later released on No Prayer).  Sorry folks, but that song is weak when compared to other songs Bruce wrote from 1984-1988. If that was the best Bruce wrote for this album, I'm sure glad they put it on hold!3.  Synth! Synth! Synth!  Hey, live a little.  Musicians as complex as those in Maiden NEED to find different ways to test themselves.  It's called maturing.  The bass/guitar synth is awesome in my opinion.  It gives this album a futuristic feel like nothing else.4.  Someone also said the band was \"burned out\" on this since it followed the huge World Slavery Tour.  Burned out?  No, only on fire.  As a guitarist, I must say that the Murray/Smith solos on this disc are BLAZING!  Check out Davey's on CSIT, or Adrian's on SOM, and then check out the pair on \"Alexander the Great\", a song Steve Harris himself recently called \"the best song we've never played live\".  Oh, and Adrian's slow solo on SIASL is proof that some of the best solos don't have to be played fast.5.  Any more complaining morons need to just pick up a live bootleg of this tour.

I have been a fan of Iron Maiden for about 2 1/2 years now, and inevitably the appeal of Iron Maiden (or any band that I've been into far some time) has somewhat worn off. However, this album gave me the feeling of \"Oh my God, this is GOOOOD...\", something which I hadn't got from an Iron Maiden album in ages!The music is well structured, the melodies are great and the lyrics are well thought out (compared to most metal bands at the time). Tracks like Caught Somewhere In Time and The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner are amazing... dammit, they're all great! I haven't owned this for long enough to decide yet, but this might evolve to be my favourite Maiden album.This is a great album. I don't care who said it was crap (one person even said that it was as bad as \"No Prayer For The Dying\"). I love this album, and it has refreshed my love for Maiden's music where even Piece Of Mind didn't when I bought that a few months ago. This album shows a real sense of maturity and progression. Don't get me wrong, I like thier older stuff as well, but many bands have either produced a string of albums that sound exactly alike or they've changed for the worse.

Stranger in  a strange land Want to have rhytm? Heaven can wait Want a good finish? Deja  VU and Alexander the great. Don't waste your time always searching for  other discs (not from maiden). Face up, make your stand... and realiza  you're watching a better one. Hey, the album can announce itself.Ha,  enjoy it! 5 stars!\n", "val": 0.02708653174340725}

The music and the lyrics on this album are fantastic and rate right up there with the  Powerslave album as one of the all time great Maiden albums.  Every song on  this album is great, and even more than 10 years later they still have the  same energy and enthusiamsm for me as they did when the album was new. A  must have for any true Maiden fan.\n", "val": 0.041908007115125656}

{"text": "This sampler from the Mishara label follows the classic Amazonian free sampler formula of \"good music for a great price.\"  Essentially you have four artists represented, Peter Bradley Adams and his former bandmate from eastmountainsouth, Kat Maslich Bode; plus Colin Devlin of the fine band The Devlins, and Barnaby Bright, a folk duo from NYC.  I've always liked Peter's music, as represented by his latest excellent album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Between-Us/dp/B005236YDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Between Us</a>.  The two PBA songs here are quite good.  As for Kat, she has released very little recorded music since the breakup of eastmountain ('04), and it's great to hear her singing again.  That leaves Colin Devlin, whose Devlins song \"Waiting\" is a favorite of mine (as heard on TV's \"Six Feet Under\"), and Barnaby Bright.  Colin's songs on this sampler are both great.  Barnaby Bright was the only name on this album I had not previously heard of, but it turns out they've also had songs on TV shows (ex., on \"E.R.\").  I mistakenly thought Barnaby was a guy, although hearing the lovely voice of Rebecca Bright singing made me realize it's just the group name.  (Rebecca is joined by her husband Nathan in the band.)  Of the two BB songs here, \"the Stone\" is really nice, with an especially sweet vocal from Rebecca, but I'm not as enamored with \"Reverend's Son,\" which has more of an ordinary Appalachian folk feel.\n", "val": 0.01658984273672104}
{"text": "First up London Bridge Is Falling Down by Peter Bradley Adams. Simpering rendition of the nursery rhyme, not sure Mr Adams had to repeat the title quite so many times.Track 2 is Barnaby Bright with Reverend's Son. Great clean female vocal dominating guitar and backing vocal on sophisticated folk song. Very nice.Colin Devlin singing Refuge is next. Another great vocal and piano opening. The vocal stays while the backing music builds some tension with stronger piano and other instruments. Very nice Folk Rock song.Track 4 is Kat Maslich Bode playing Sky Falls. Very cool female vocal over active band complimenting the song. Sound quality is not the best but the singer imposes her will over the song and brings us a brilliant somber track. This ain't Folk this is great.Another Barnaby Bright song this one is The Stone. Same great female vocal, stronger band providing much more noise on another quality song.Colin Devlin playing The Heart Won't Be Denied. Low key male vocal dominates this simple singer songwriter number. Nothing wrong with this. Sounds great.Track 7 Kat Maslich Bode playing March. Slow female s/sw feel to this song that allows Kat to showcase her voice as she ranges through powerful feelings in the lyrics. Another very nice song extended ending.Peter Bradley Adams with Full Moon Song closes this excellent Folk/Rock/Singer songwriter sampler from Mishara Music. Much better than the annoying London Bridge we opened with, Mr Adams picks his guitar and sings a very nice controlled mellow song. Competent unspectacular song although I note from Wikipedia he has already arrived, probably playing better songs than this.Windows Media Player codes the Genre of this free download as Rock, Amazon covers itself by listing Folk/General, Rock/General & Rock/Singer-Songwriters. They are all right. There is no Hard Rock there are some very good slow ballads and a couple of singers with a lively band behind them. Every track is very good (except London Bridge, you may like it). Everyone should download the sampler for those quieter evenings or plane journeys, or delete and regret.Mishara Music should pair tracks from the same artist (in my opinion) it works well on other samplers. For this sampler it does not matter, artists excel songs are great. Download now many recent Amazon mp3 samplers have not been free for long or have been withdrawn.\n", "val": 0.014522873796522617}

I guess they knew what they were doing by being so generous, right? If you like single voices with a folk-artist appeal, you will probably like the artists on this album. It's going to be fun finding more of their work and seeing what else I like of theirs. I suspect I will like most of it.\n", "val": 0.028823381289839745}

However, from the feminist perspective it just doesn't go far enough (but really, should we expect Disney to try to change the world of patriarchy, stereotypes and status quo?). I watched the video on youtube and I'm not impressed. It just doesn't show the actual message in the video. They show Selena dressed in a gown, high heals, tons of make up, perfect bed head prancing around NYC looking like million bucks. Easy for her to say \"who says you're not beautiful\" - nobody says that to HER. I want to see musician go a stop further, show real girls, real kids - no make up, no pretense, in wheel chair -struggling to learn to walk again, fighting cancer - hair lost from chemo, with Downs syndrome - being hugged by fellow students etc...Now that would be a powerful message, not some millionaire teen with above average looks dressed and made up by a team of Disney specialists.

{"text": "I can't help but think that so many successful electro artists have the same formula for 'changing' their sounds as they mature in their sophomore or junior albums.  Definitely seems the case with Digitalism.Upon first listen, I thought it was too much of a departure from their raw and gritty \"Idealism\" so I shelved it for a while.  Recently, I sort of happened to come upon it again while leaving my iTunes going and \"I Love You Dude\" being on.  After having listened to this a few times, I can definitely say it is a successful follow up to their first record.Not every track will blow you away, and the tracks don't shine as much as maybe \"Pogo\" and \"Idealistic\" do from the first record, but there are definitely amazing tracks on the new record.  What I think is the most important is that this album works much better conceptually and is more consistent.  Easily, you can put this on and listen to it front to back without skipping any tracks.  I find that with \"Idealism\" I often skip to those few tracks that I feel 'shine'To an earlier point, I liken the change in sound to Daft Punk's transformation.  \"Homework\" and \"Discovery\" onwards are totally different worlds of sound to me.  To this day, I easily find \"Homework\" as a better record.  In the case of Digitalism, I would say though their sound has changed slightly to a softer and more generally accepted form of electo, it is for the better.  Their sounds will continue to mature, and though they have swayed slightly from the grittiness of \"Idealism\" I hear influence from Audion, Chemical Brothers, Presets, Prodigy, Cassius, and others.Bottom line, you may experience a slightly different sound from their first record that may or may not take getting used to.. but for me it was a positive change and the record is a solid one.\n", "val": 0.006899943575263023}

{"text": "It's a tricky thing to make earnest pop music. The style is not well suited for sincerity, and artists have to strike a delicate balance between 1) preserving the universal appeal of pop at the risk of their sentiment being rendered insincere or clichd, and 2) properly giving credence to their emotional state at the risk of losing listeners who don't share their sentiments, seeming preachy, lyrically clumsy, etc.Patrick Wolf has always exuded a certain earnestness in his ramshackle approach to pop music, but his lyrics have been decidedly cryptic. Expressive, yes, but the words were not meant to be literal depictions of his personal experiences. That approach has changed a bit with Lupercalia. The campy, theatrical side of Patrick (not to mention much of the darkness) has been shed in favor of a more direct and personal approach to songwriting. Our beloved restless artist has found love, and so he's finally comfortable enough to be his own drag.For me, this is quite a refreshing change of pace. Not just for Patrick, but for music in general. In the wake of recent worldwide economic decline, the most popular of pop has become relentlessly escapist, and the more serious strains have become increasingly somber. It's nice, then, to have an album that's so unabashedly positive, and yet devoid of any campy fantastical trappings.The first two tracks of Lupercalia collectively offer a devastating moment of pop brilliance: hopeful, direct, tender, and exuberant. Earnestly so. The rest of the album isn't as consistently inspired as its introduction, but there are many highlights, including The Future, Time of My Life, and Together.It's not perfect, though, as some of Patrick's gambles don't quite pay off. Slow Motion is the song most likely to be ridiculed, due to its lyrics and incongruous mood. Admittedly, my immediate reaction to it was negative, but even this flawed song has moments of beauty and inspiration enough to warrant my time. Mostly, though, Lupercalia offers a seemingly effortless high that Patrick maintains throughout. Moreover, its economy of sound serves as a welcome contrast to the excess of the Bachelor, which mired its otherwise strong songs in a sea of voiceovers, choirs, and other sonic decorations.Some people may not realize it, but Patrick has always been a hopeless romantic, even in his darkest hours. He's nothing if not full of passion, so who better to craft an album reflecting the simple joys of love and intimacy than he? This is one of the very few truly sincere love albums to be released in the last 20 years. Is it cheesy? Of course, that's part of the point! But it feels honestly expressive of real human experience. Not to mention many of the songs make for a great soundtrack to your own ventures in love and intimacy. We owe you one, Pat.I'm sure plenty of older fans will bemoan the lack of many things that they have come to love about his music; Lupercalia has no folk stylings, no dissonant synth textures, no fantastical lyrics, and it DOES have non-stop lovey gushing from a man who often wears his gloom like a badge of pride.

{"text": "Were all familiar with Rachmaninoffs major orchestral works now, with this collection, youll hear some of his less familiar work less familiar, maybe, but no less important in their mental intensity.  The earliest composer in my personal history is Rachmaninoff.  His music filled our home even before I walked.  If you are considering this collection, well then, you probably had a similar childhood.  Low cost mp3's have opened the doors to important music.  I sit at my keyboard and Pro-Tools and impress my friends, but real composers think it out in their heads. The entire orchestra lives in their brain. They may, on their piano, experiment with novel juxtapositioning of new note groupings; but the final voicing takes place in their brain, and then, only then, do they take it to paper. This is how the biggies did and still do it... Beethoven, Brahma, Schoenberg, Handel, Vivaldi, Boulez, Debussy, Clementi, Leonhardt... and many, many more. This is a quality missing from most current composition, certainly missing in my method.

{"text": "Since the days of those well reminded years in which LP format commanded the market I bought this fabulous set: impressive and astounding all the way through. Michael Ponti is part of the legend of piano. In his debut on Carnegie hall in 1972, he was labeled like \"the Horowitz of the new generations\". Winner of the coveted Busoni Prize in 1964, and owner of an enviable expressiveness, demolishing technique, sheer lyricism and enraptured poetry, no other Western pianist has established such ravishing committment with the Russian piano literature like him: as a matter of fact, he recorded Scriabin's and Tchaikovsky's complete piano music, without including Mili Balakirev, Anton Rubinstein, Nikolai Medtner or Nikolai Rimski Korsakov, for instance. And today when all of us are well aware about the awful stroke (late nineties) that avoided Mr. Ponti to use his right arm this legacy confirms why he was one of the most genuine Ambassadors of the most variegated pianistic repertoire you may imagine.His approach with Rachmaninoff is mesmerizing. Works such as the Sonata No. 1 Op. 13, Sonata No. 2 Op. 28, Morceaux Op. 10, Six Musical Moments Op. 16 were performed  with such degree of conviction and intelectual honesty that it will leave you amazed. Beyond the fact Sviatoslav Richter achieved an unsurpassed pinnacle with Rachmaninov's piano music (Olympia Records), we have the chance to listen a sincere, zealous performed and idiomatic Rachmaninov without cheap sentimentalism. There are several highlights such as Corelli variations or variations on a Chopin's theme. Frankly speaking, this is a real collector item under any angle you regard it.Don't let pass this unique opportunity to listen and enjoy at last the integral pianistic literature of this Russian icon of the first half of the XX Century and perhaps the last Romantic composer.\n", "val": 0.02842007763683796}

{"text": "Via; Blind RaccoonMickey ThomasMickey Thomas Marauder (Gigatone)Mickey Thomas is a musical marauder, always on the search for worthy treasure to challenge his outsized vocal talents. The golden-throated singer from Georgia blindsided blues fans in 1976 when he sang like an angel on Elvin Bishop's \"Fooled Around and Fell in Love.\" He then thrilled arena rock fans when he joined the Jefferson Starship/Starship in 1979 and starred on \"We Built This City on Rock and Roll,\" \"Sara\" and \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now,\" among others, through the eighties and beyond. After years engaged in a variety of projects, like a fearless vocal gunslinger in 2009 he trained his sights back on the blues for a stunning and authentic set of classics with the stomping Bluesmasters. Now, seven years after his last album of original rock, Over the Edge, Thomas has harnessed his muscular and versatile chops to present a hip and wide-ranging selection of classic rock covers spanning decades and styles that only he could perform with such utter confidence and conviction.As opposed to his basically self-contained blues band from the previous outing, Thomas commandeers a virtual orchestra of exceptional supporting musicians including a full honking horn section, the heavenly Unity Community Choir and many executive producers. To his credit and that of his friend, producer, keyboardist and ace guitarist Jeff Tamelier, who plays \"Keith Richards\" to \"Mick\" Thomas, the result is a cohesive and strikingly expansive 16-song set and the Stones' \"Gimme Shelter\" is the perfect lead-off tune. Showcasing Thomas' brawny, bluesy growl and the Unity Community Choir, with the band in a funky R&B groove flavored with evocative and expressive acoustic Dobro slide guitar from Mark McGee, an inventive, simmering version is created with all the drama and apocalyptic menace of the original. After a scatting intro over trilling keyboards, Thomas slide-steps right into Peter Gabriel's \"Sledgehammer\" (1986) that faithfully replicates the horn-driven eighties' pop dance track vibe of the original, but with a crucial injection of Memphis-style soul from the lead singer and his nimble rhythm section.Thomas was initially influenced to sing after witnessing the Beatles in 1965 and they are well-represented and done justice on the album. \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" (1970), Paul McCartney's hit from his first solo album, is kick started by slashing electric slide guitar courtesy McGee in the intro, while Thomas actually sounds \"amazed\" as he ramps up his vocal even beyond \"Macca's\" Little Richard-inspired shouting. The epic Britpop power ballad \"Champagne Supernova\" (1995) from Oasis provides Thomas an excellent opportunity to wrap his supple vocal chords around the tuneful melody that soars over the dramatic chord progression. After a likewise soaring lead guitar solo from Jeff Tamelier that builds in intensity, he takes full advantage to create an orgasmic coda, scatting with lusty abandon.The Beatles' \"Rain\" (1966) could have been written for Thomas as he manages to skillfully and joyfully channel the innocent spirit of the British Invasion era while using his considerable skills to extend and embellish the vocal melody. Clanging guitars and dynamics of volume, along with gorgeous harmonies by the backup singers of Thomas, Tamelier, Marla Major and Bill Bently produce a remarkably innovative version that also contains a smile-inducing segue into \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" from Revolver. Leaping forward decades, Thomas continues to display his infallible ear for picking great covers when he sings \"Chasing Cars\" (2006) by Snow Patrol. Totally immersing himself in the bittersweet lyric line, he builds the \"emo\" ballad with nuance and restraint while communicating without irony the passion and yearning in the original performance.The later Beatles oeuvre is acknowledged with a deeply moving version of \"Across the Universe\" (1969) that functions as a fitting tribute to the complicated genius that was John Lennon. Changing the matter-of-fact earnestness of the original into a defiant declaration with \"nothing's gonna change my world,\" Thomas could again be speaking his own mind as he intelligently references the \"hela\" coda from \"Hello Goodbye\" for added poignancy. Unafraid to go where no \"soul man\" has gone before, Thomas tackles \"Supermassive Black Hole\" (2006) from Muse that appeared on the Twilight soundtrack. Even more ominous than the original with a bigger sound emanating from the heavy rocking rhythm section of Tamelier, bassist Bobby Vega and drummer Prairie Prince, it features Thomas digging way deeper into the lyrics. \"Voices\" (1984) by Russ Ballard, that once graced an episode of Miami Vice, gets the full Mickey Thomas \"treatment\" with a huge, arena-filling sound sporting thunderous rhythm and searing lead guitars and his far more urgent, expressive and soulful vocals. As with some of his other song selections, the lyric of \"don't look back, look straight ahead, don't turn away then the voice it said...\" would seem to have personal resonance.\"Oh! Darling\" (1969) gave Paul McCartney the chance to salute his fifties rock `n' roll roots on Abbey Road and Thomas utilizes it to do double-duty as a tribute to his roots. Starting with a tinny old radio sound, it evolves to the horn section doubling the classic fifties bass line and aggressive punctuation in the stop-time verses. Giving free rein to his rawest vocal technique, Thomas pleads to his lover for all he is worth, and it is considerable. Slipping right into the fatback R&B groove of Joe Cocker's \"Delta Lady\" (1969) penned by Leon Russell, Thomas opts for a more traditional sound with acoustic and electric slide guitars from McGee adding a nice, greasy down home touch. Rollicking and raucous without being bombastic, it is one of many highlights on the album as Thomas sings his big heart out, slyly changing the bridge lyric to,\"...oh, when I'm home again in Georgia\" instead of \"...in England\" that was appropriate to Cocker's homeland. And where the British gent growls ferociously, Thomas exhorts with pure gospel/R&B/soul, as the glorious Unity Community Choir spurs him on to even greater heights in the climactic coda.In a trip west to Los Angeles by way of the Midwest of Bob Seger, Thomas again seems to be mining autobiographical territory with \"Hollywood Nights\" (1978). Going the gravel-throated Seger one better, he takes the dramatic, surging rock anthem past the Hollywood Hills to the peak of the San Bernardino Mountains with his unstoppable vocal power that rises from a whisper to a full out, breathtaking wail that matches the \"singing\" tenor sax of Bill Slais. A shift in gears to Canadian Tom Cochrane's \"Life is a Highway\" (1991) is another natural fit for the versatile Thomas and his eclectic tastes. However, after entering acapella with his backup singers performing their best gospel voices in the hooky chorus, he has rapper Jay Dot take on Cochrane's credible rap vocal from the verse and bring it back to the \"'hood\" for some urban grit and a startling time warp. By the outro chorus, Thomas, Jay Dot and the backup singers are ad libbing in a joyous, hand clapping round robin. Jumping genres like an Olympic hurdler, Thomas next takes on the bone crushing, \"down under\" hard rock of AC/DC and their relatively light-hearted \"Moneytalks\" (1990). The band enthusiastically turns the heavy \"pop rock\" into a romping, fist-pumping, testosterone-fueled track. Thomas does a spot-on, tongue-in-cheek impersonation of AC/DC singer Brian Johnson while also injecting his own inimitable exuberance and irrepressible soulfulness as McGee howls on slide like a Tasmanian Devil.\"Tempted\" (1981), from Squeeze, the British New Wavers, was their take on \"blue-eyed soul\" and it allows Thomas to figuratively put on a skinny tie and sing an ironic love song. As is his won't and likely beyond his control as it is in his DNA, he ups the soul ante incrementally while the band exhibits more energy compared to the studied insouciance of the original. Given his predilection for the Beatles, it is only right that Thomas should end with George Harrison's \"Wah Wah\" (1970) that seems to be about not needing a lot of things - drugs, fame, hassles, the material world etc. Whereas the original is an almost cacophonous whirlwind of voices and instruments, including the ubiquitous wah wah pedal played by Eric Clapton, here the arrangement is cleaner and tighter, while again Thomas gets far inside the song and rides the angular harmony of the progression in order to express the profound philosophy of the lyric content.Fine wine mellows and improves with age, as do many great singers. The great and fine Mickey Thomas, however, continues to improve while leaving the concept of \"mellow\" for others to ponder as he refuses to allow the passage of time to halt the pursuit of his musical goals. Country blues legend Charlie Patton was once billed as the \"Masked Marauder,\" but Thomas proudly proclaims his identity as a musician dedicated to giving his audience the full measure of his vast artistic accomplishments. The power and strength of his vocal gifts insures that he will continue to rock on far into the future.Dave Rubin2005 KBA winner in Journalism.

{"text": "I only own one other collection from this company, (99 Darkest Pieces of Classical Music) but even so I have repeats of 15 of the included songs. If you are thinking you will find new music in here, you may be sadly mistaken. That being said, $1.99 is almost too good of a price to pass up. In the end, I did purchase this album. But, I think that if you have not purchased from this company before, this is an excellent bargain for 11 hours of music.\n", "val": 0.0004747623752336949}
{"text": "Let me start by agreeing with the previous reviewer -- this is great music, and if you don't have a lot of these \"99\" sets already, I'd say jump on it.The only downside if you're new to these sets is that these are almost all bits and pieces taken out of larger works, so you're not hearing what the composer wrote -- just the beginning, middle or end. That's not ideal, but in a thematic collection like this, well, OK.But if you've been following the \"99 Most Whatever\" series from Sweden's X5 Music Group for a while, you've seen this music before. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer on that score -- compared to my own music library, which contains most, but not all of the X5 collections, this set includes 59 tracks that are outright repeats. A further 26 tracks are music that has been featured before, but now in different performance. This is fine, but I realized I don't really need a new performance of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Spring\" Sonata, or to hear the St. Petersburg New Philharmonia's take on the second movement of Haydn's \"Surprise\" Symphony right now. (Note that the overlap numbers are calculated only against X5 collections, not the completely separate \"99 Must-Have\" series from the LA-based Cobra Entertainment.)This leaves 14 tracks of music that hasn't featured before. And while the overture to an Antonio Salieri opera sounds kind of interesting, I also realized that buying these warmed over recycled sets of music they've already sold us would just encourage them to keep putting out more of the same. So I'm sitting this one out.Here are some more numbers: 81 of the 99 tracks are Mozart (37), Beethoven (29) or Haydn (15). Excerpts from Rossini (4) and Luigi Boccherini (3) are also featured.Just for the record -- and I realize a lot of people won't really care, which is fine -- X5 cheated quite a bit by including most of the 29 Beethoven tracks in a \"Classical Era\" set. While Beethoven is in fact recognized as the most prominent cusp between the Classical and the Romantic periods, his real significance is (I would argue) as the towering figure in the foundation of the Romantic Era. A lot of his early works did cling to the traditions of Haydn and Mozart, and can be considered Classical in style, but almost all the works here are definitely by the \"Romantic\" Beethoven. And one -- the \"Grosse F&uuml;ge\" -- was already (again, I would argue) looking well beyond Romanticism and into the coming Modern Era. So X5 has done some considerable fudging on its \"Classical Era\" theme.But no matter, it's great music, and if you haven't been buying these sets regularly, I'm sure it's very much worth your while.\n", "val": 6.0649934312095866e-05}
{"text": "Eleven hours of music--how can I complain?I was initially worried that this collection would have a great deal of overlap with the similarly named 99 Most Essential Classical Pieces, but after a quick overview, the two collections don't seem to have much overlap (<10 songs), and even fewer outright repeats.

{"text": "This collection is a fine one. As you may know Amazon makes these 99 Most Essentials available fairly frequently. I confess to having a handful of them.  As you might expect with 99 clips in these they can repeat. After all what is good for relaxation or meditation or spring thoughts is likely also to be thought a classic. That said I think the shift artist too some and different pieces from different conductor/orchestra can and do often sound different.If I have to give a dig on these the collection is fragmentary so you aren't reviewing complete pieces which for any classical music is much longer (most usually) piece. Thus the small piece is taken somewhat out of its context. The price you pay for a review of this nature. I know that in buying it though.Mostly I use this as a good background music to over come the noise in the open office environment of cubes. The music is good, its rendering suffices (mp3 256k) that it reasonably matches what my mp3 and headphones can deliver.I you are looking for a long play list of easily listening classical music it is a good collection of some you already know and some that are likely new to you.\n", "val": 0.01170736737549305}

{"text": "I'm not really going to get into the whole \"these aren't the complete works\" or \"this has duplicates\" arguments, I'm not really a classical music aficionado, and I'm just not that picky I suppose when something costs $2 and has 99 songs. However, I will say that I have been more than pleasantly surprised with this set.On a given day, you can most often find me listening to rock and hip-hop genres; classical music really doesn't make it on to my iPod, so I'm not the one to pick apart every piece of this compilation. I purchased this because I wanted something that would act both as enjoyable noise (I feel white noise is good, but a waste of listening to with earbuds), and wouldn't interfere with productivity. See, the problem, at least for me, when I listen to rock and hip-hop music, it gets me to entwined with the words/lyrics, that I can't concentrate while listening. Classical music such as this works perfect, I can both be productive, and listen to a fantastic score at the same time (and it significantly improves my mood, and even seems to improve my productivity).As for the music itself, it is all familiar pieces; I'm certain anyone, even those who don't listen to classical music, will easily recognize almost all of these pieces. I will say they are performed more than adequate, and in fact I really enjoy these performances. I've picked up cheap classical cds in the past, and some of them are really, really bad; sloppily played, and even worse sloppily conducted.So, to wrap up/summarize, I think the set is more than worth the $2 I paid, duplicates or not. These are familiar pieces that most people will know, and are performed quite well, and really I would go so far as to say everyone should at least buy this set if you don't own any classical sets. These are \"classics\" in every sense of the word, and even someone as young as myself, who's addicted to hard rock and rap, can still easily appreciate this. Oh, and the Amazon cloud works perfect, because I don't even have to download to the PC, I can just listen to these in my browser!5/5 stars\n", "val": 0.0024310729932039976}

Excellent lead-off track \"Safe and Sound\" epitomizes Capital Cities' approach of over-filling the 3-minutes running time with one delightful surprise after another.  Just try not to dig it.  The mid-tempo burn of \"I Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo\" is another highlight.  Any mix tape nerds will get a kick out of the lyrics, and the guitar hook during the refrain is irresistible as well.  Even the least good song, closing number \"Love Away,\" has so many redeeming qualities (like a great guitar solo and tons of cool keyboard sounds) that the happy piano chord pounding and sunshine lyrics can't get too annoying.  This EP certainly whets the listener's appetite for a full length Capital Cities release.Bottom Line: Alternative/Indie Electronic and Alternative/Indie Pop fans, buy this EP.

On paper this collection looks great, and having purchased a number of the daily deals on 99 song themed collections of classical works, I figured this would be in the same vein: perhaps not the greatest of performances, but still strong enough to stand together. However, the majority of the songs I have listened to from this collection are poor arrangements poorly performed (or more likely, strung through a synth program and propped up to pose as a performance).If you have the patience to endure the hair-tearing quality of \"Yellow Rose Of Texas\" and \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\" in order to find the comparative gems in \"The Washington Post\" or \"Stars And Stripes Forever,\" then the price may make it worth your while. If what sounds like poorly synthesized and haphazardly arranged songs set your teeth on edge as they do mine, you might be better off skipping this one.

This track was on the Bloodshot 2010 sampler, still sounds great, rock a billy-ish song bopping along.Next song is Intertwined by Maggie Bjorklund w/Mark Lanegan.

{"text": "It seems that The Cure is making a comeback in the form of all these new acts that sound old.  You can thrust Washed Out in that equation.  It's interesting that they chose such a name for their group, considering the fact that their musical direction leaves them sounding a bit, well, washed out.  It's not that I can't appreciate this breed of music; it's just that the synth heavy beat becomes rather stagnant over the running time because there is no real change in the musicality.  It just remains redundant from start to finish.  I would have liked some swells here and there to differentiate key moments in the song.  Instead, `Amor Fati' seems to go nowhere.  I'm sure there will be some who really enjoy this, and I will admit that in parts this song (and apparently this group) shines.  Vocally, I see a lot of potential, but the flow of the song itself is so monotone that the vocals take on a similar shading.  And yet, despite my apparent dissatisfaction with this particular song, I ultimately hear something that has me intrigued and wanting to hear more.  I know, strange right?  Well, I am interested in hearing more from them to see how well rounded they are as a group.  If the balance of their album is in this same vein then I'll be staying far away, but if they can use their talented parts to create something a little more unique and interesting than I can see them becoming something I thoroughly enjoy.So, I personally kind of hate this song but I am interested in hearing what else this group can do.\n", "val": 0.0005747504765167832}
{"text": "\"Amor Fati\" is Latin for \"love of fate\" or \"love of one's fate\". It's used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life - including suffering and loss - as good.On first listen I thought this might be a track from some synth-heavy, europop outfit. I dug a little and was surprised to find that Washed Out (Ernest Greene) hails from Atlanta, Georgia.

The synths and the percussion are in the forefront and the echoey vocals are nearly lost in the mix. This makes for a very atmospheric sound that envelopes the listener and can be either good or bad depending on your tastes. I like it, though I've heard other bands pull it off with better aplomb.Despite the heavy meaning behind the lyrics, 'Amor Fati' is a very summery song that brings nostalgic thoughts of sunlit beaches brief, bright summer romances. It makes a nice addition to a play list of that sort and is from Washed Out's upcoming album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Within-Without/dp/B00505470O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Within & Without</a>.~ Kort\n", "val": 0.0001649726036703214}

{"text": "With four traditional tunes, five originals, and eight covers, the Missouri-based string band Blackberry Winter has produced a pleasant album chock full of downhome flavor and personality. These self-professed \"old hillbillies\" have long resumes with folk, big band, swing, rockabilly and even funk music. Common interests in music, friendship and camaraderie bring the folks together from many walks of life. Blackberry Winter's seven eclectic members have also pursued careers in journalism, broadcasting, photography, nature study, music teaching, massage therapy, realty and home remodeling. The band originally formed when singer/storyteller Marideth Sisco pulled them together to play soundtrack music for \"Winter's Bone,\" an award-winning, thrilling melodrama set in the Missouri Ozarks. The rest of the affable group is Dennis Crider (guitar), Bo Brown (guitar, mandolin, Dobro), Van Colbert (clawhammer banjo), Linda Stoffel (vocals, washboard), Tedi May (bass), and Billy Ward (fiddle). The album's liner notes don't credit the male singers, but one would presume that it's Bo Brown singing his own self-penned \"Small Town.\"As an original tribute to their home, the album opens with Sisco's passionate statement about the \"rich, deep current of life always running through these Ozarks Hills.\" The songs with spare instrumental settings are especially effective for the nostalgic and evocative sentiments. \"Cold Rain and Snow\" brings chills with its rustic accompaniment of only banjo and fiddle. Tom Waits' \"House Where Nobody Lives\" and Hedy West/Don West's \"Anger in the Land\" and Hazel Dickens' \"Fly Away Little Pretty Bird\" are also sparsely arranged to impart old-timey front porch intensity that is remarkably powerful storytelling. The project also taps the repertoires of such luminaries as Dave Macon, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Natalie Merchant, Kate Long, and Bill Carlisle. I've heard several bands cover \"Who Will Watch the Home Place,\" and that kind of song seems a perfect fit for this band's ethos and approach....as do \"Gone Home\" and \"The Water is Wide.\"Blackberry Winter is a successful regional band, and they recently completed a 27-city \"Amazing Geriatric Hillbilly U.S. World Tour\" to promote the Winter's Bone soundtrack. It's nice to see them keeping the ensemble together, as well as pursuing a variety of string band styles. While large-scale commercial success may elude them, I'm sure they have a solid fan base in Old Mizzoo. \"Use It Up\" might even have a biographical thread - \"no need to strive for riches, you can patch it up with kisses, it ain't old, it ain't old, it ain't old, it's just seen a lot of life.\"  Sung from the heart, their music helps us lay down heavy burdens and weary bodies. A swingy song like \"City Kicks\" might best capture their prevalent message - \"I'm going to throw away all my bills, when I get to those Ozark Hills, and trade these old hard times for an easy chair. And I ain't gonna need no liquor, gonna hang with them guitar pickers, gonna play away my blues when I get down there.\"  (Joe Ross, Sun209: The Americana Music Journal)\n", "val": 0.01902509108185768}

{"text": "I've loved Marideth Sisco and the Blackberry Winter Band since the beginning of the movie \"Winter's Bone\" when Marideth can be heard singing the \"Missouri Waltz.\"  There are no repeats on this album from the \"Winter's Bone\" soundtrack. These are from-the-heart songs from Ozark country ranging from acappella songs like \"The Water's Wide\" to the rousing and harmonious \"City Kicks.\"  There is the warning of the evils of \"Co'dine\" and the very somber \"Who Will Watch the Homeplace.\"The vocalists and instrumentalists are all represented, with Marideth having the lead in vocal pieces. But rest assured that there is some fine guitar and banjo pickin' as well as Tedi's upright bass and some mighty fine fiddlin'.  This is one of those albums that has both feet going and the head going, too, because there isn't anything else to do while listening to such excellent arrangements of these 17 songs besides sing along and move. They are so good and so perfected that we close our eyes, get the feet tapping and enjoy the bliss.Marideth's voice is so well-suited to this kind of music and I'd bet other types, too, and she has great versatility and control of a strong, lovely voice.  She describes herself and the band as a group of \"old hillbillies\" but this is one group of old hillbillies that is full of a sweet talent that enriches the rest of us who know this band and own this album.If you like country or folk music and even if you don't, this album leaves you feeling good and better off for listening.

Compared to their older music, I found they have a crisper cleaner sound that far More people will enjoy. I certainly am.The song \"Bounce\" while seeming simple, is one of the best pieces of 'Good Time' rock I've heard in a while, and good time rock is something that is woefully lacking in the music industry these days.  When I played this in a rock club it was an instant hit, this song just screams out to grab your girl and head for a dance floor and well...  Bounce!For a power ballads, their songs \"Don't Forget about me\" and \"Tonight\" are the tops.  Lyrical lines filled with emotion and smooth but pointed harmonies makes these two songs winners.The whole CD is simply good rock that goes against the grain of todays screamo and rap rock, and delivers something with a modern sound, catchy melodies,  that almost anyone of any rock generation will enjoy.

Actually a bunch of the songs have a killer guitar riff in them in addition to powerful sing along choruses. But after hearing \"put that drink down\" you'll be singing it for days or even weeks later. Besides track 3, my favs are 2,6,7,8. I have read that track 10 is a tribute to their home town. All in all, im glad i've stumbled across these guys, yes there are others like them, but they are disctinctive enough from other counterparts who many of us are sick and tired of ie. nickelback, daughtry, theory of a deadman, etc. Thanks for reading and baby...........put that drink down!\n", "val": 0.003902707016095519}

{"text": "I first heard these guys while searching on Youtube.  I was going to see Alter Bridge, and I saw that Emphatic was on the bill as the opening act.  I came across the song \"Stronger\" and immediately liked what my ears were hearing.  This brings us to the debut album from Emphatic, entitled \"Damage.\"1. Do I - I Love this song.  To me, as a new up-and-coming band appealing to the masses of rock 'n roll this is the type of song you want to lead with.  Pretty heavy, solid vocals and a catchy chorus.  I was also pumped when they played his live.  For me, this is the strongest song on the album which is both good and bad.  5/52. Get Paid - A good follow-up song here as it remains pretty heavy and seemingly just a solid rocker.  The one weakness I see (which begins here and follows repeatedly throughout the album) is the weakness of the lyrics.  A good, solid rocking tne overall; just not the best lyrically.  4/53. Put Down The Drink - A solid outing.  This song is caught in the middle somewhere as I wouldn't quite consider it a ballad, but it has elements of such a thing.  Again, some aspects of the lyrics as a whole can come across slightly cheesy, but overall, another good rocker here with a slightly slower feel.  4/54. Bounce - Let me just say, I like the energy of this track I do.  I also understand that this song is probably the one single that the record company made the band write and release in order to get any play and/or any extensive support on a tour.  Overall, a solid strsight rocker which is very heavy.  However, lyrically some of the cheesiest I've heard, and one you can tell is simply there for radio play.  I feel that this song is a step down from what I can see this band is capable of doing.  3/55. A Place To Fall - Luckily the band seems to (no pun intended here) bounce back with a very, very solid song.  Again, I personally wouldn't consider this song a ballad by the standards, but it is a very good track.  Lyrically they are stronger and the words really seem to mean something.  Overall the band seems to be very well put together here and shows us a glimpse of what may be coming in the future.  5/56. Beg - Another mediocre song follows however.  This for me is quite a shame and this is where I begin to see the ups and downs of this record as a whole.  Albeit this song isn't quite as bad lyrically as \"Bounce\" but it seems to me the band is trying to hard to come across as Motley-Crue type rockers who just on't care about the law, etc.  Maybe it's just the record company again but I feel they can do better then this.  3.5/57. Tonight - This is the ballad of the album.  Where the other two were riding the border, here is where the band brought out their softer side.  For me though, something comes up short.  It's not a bad song per se, it just comes across as slightly a generic sounding ballad.  One that again, every band NEEDS on their album before the record company will back it 100%.  Ballads bring in the most well-rounded radio play and that is what record companies want.  Overall, good but very average.  3/58. Pride - I want to like this song I really do.  There are elements to the song that I do like.  It seems to be a very positive and inspiring type song, but again the lyrics are the downfall.  With a very solid musical arraingment (particularly good drum playing) the lyrics just don't make this song believable.  Overall, a good attempt but falls short.  3.5/59. Original Sin - I like this song.  This is a song where again, the band shows signs of what they can do.  Lyrically even this song isn't tat strong, but it is a very straight foward rocker and gets you hooked.  A song that will get you pumped.  Good track by the guys here.  4.5/510. Don't Forget About Me - The album closes here with another ballad.  This song however has some good lyrics and one you can tell comes from prsonal experience by one or all of the bandmates.  Good guitar playing here and the vocals just seem to gel, harmonizing with everything.  The album ends on a very high note here.  4.5/5Overall, you get a debut album by Emphatic which I consider slightly above average.  I would give this album a total of 3.5/5 stars.  To me they need to work on a couple things.  One, the lyrics.  Cheesy on some (okay most) of the album.  Two, being who they are.  Don't let the record company scare you.  I urge anyone to give these guys a chance.  They put on a very good live show and have massive potential.  One final thing, I would have replaced one song (probably Beg or Pride) with \"Stronger.\"  That's a killer track that needs to be released on an album in the future.\n", "val": 0.001206517219543457}
{"text": "As a long time listener of Emphatic on our local radio station in Omaha, I had come to love their high energy, hard rock sound. This album does not represent their true style, in my mind. That being said, the album is just fine and I do enjoy it, but to me it is not the band I am used to. This album has a pop rock vibe to it and one that I think a lot of people would really enjoy. Do not buy it looking for a HARD rock sound though.\n", "val": 0.009271659888327122}

{"text": "What is happening in popular music today?  While most popular music slithers off into a netherworld of often talentless \"shock-jock\" slop singing, over on the jazz aisle some of the most talented delightful jazz singers in more than a generation continue to come forward.  Joseph Leo Bwarie is one of those.  Listeners looking for ground-breaking \"alternative\" performances should look elsewhere.  What we have here is a dynamite singer belting out standards from the Great American Songbook, sung in front of one smokin' band--all wrapped in delicious, if more or less conventional arrangements.Inevitably, I have to compare this album with \"Ella . . . Of Thee I Swing\" recorded by then 13 year-old Nikki Yanofsky back in 2007.  Though Bwarie is considerably older, he follows essentially the same formula that Yanofsky followed on that landmark debut album:  A very good choice of standards from the Great American Songbook, arranged to swing and \"comp\" the singer's voice, and a first-rate (and I do mean first-rate) hard driving and swinging full big band. The mastering on this album is also first-rate.  The only thing that could make this album better would be if it had been recorded in front of a live audience.  I suspect the result would have been even more electric.  Some jazz purists might complain that Bwarie's singing is just a little bit too \"pop\" and \"commercial,\" and not quite enough \"jazz\"--but those same critics would have to say the same thing about some of the efforts from Frank Sinarta, Ella Fitzgerald, and Sarah Vaughan at the heights of their careers.  No one ever has doubted those stars' status as \"jazz vocalists\"--I doubt that anyone will doubt Bwarie's jazz chops as time goes on. The only tune on the album which might give some credence to the \"pop\" criticism is the last, \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?\" where Bwarie sounds just a little like Barry Manilow--the only \"syrupy\" moment on the whole album.There is no tune on this album that I dislike--all all quite lovely.  My favorite tune on the album is the great tune \"Frenesi,\" made popular originally by Artie Shaw about three-quarters of a century ago.  Bwarie's swinging treatment makes this chestnut fresh as a daisy once again.  Some other highlights:  \"Night and Day\" is another swinger--this one where we can hear a orchestral \"bridge\" swung in the way that would do justice to a Neal Hefti, Nelson Riddle, or Billy May chart written for Sinatra. Bwarie proves he can swing a great ballad on \"When the Sun Comes Out\"--though it has been recorded from everybody from Barbra Streisand to June Christy, Bwarie once again makes it fresh.  Oh, yes, that band really swings again on the \"bridge.\"  Finally, a just plain nice ballad from the 1920's, \"What'll I Do?\"  Here the band and Bwarie, along with a nice solo by veteran guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli, weave a great musical tapestry around a great ballad.It's nice to see a new very talented male jazz singer come to the forefront to even the wonderful tide of new great female jazz vocalists that have come along in the last few years.  It's also refreshing to see that there are still some really swinging instrumentalists coming along to carry the torch of swinging jazz forward.  A lot of today's pop music will quickly fade--it's the music on this album that will last.  Why?  Because, as Linda Ronstadt said a number of years ago about songs from the Great American Songbook, \"they were so well-crafted.\"  And, maybe, because--when performed by a talented singer like Joseph Leo Bwarie in front of a big, great band--they touch the heart and soul in a way that little that is recorded today really can.\n", "val": 0.002719967160373926}

{"text": "[excerpted from Vocalstandards.com review]Broadway talent with a club singer's heart...JLB was intro'd to me last summer by a friend that had intercepted Bwarie from Joe's Frankie Valli role in the touring Jersey Boys show.  Whenever I get vectored toward a Broadway/stage star that is branching out to the American Songbook, more often than not I end up disappointed.Though dripping with vocal dexterity and range, I usually find the Broadway trained vocal style lacking ... the prototypical hyper precision and near sterile intonation that may serve them well for versatile stage career, leaves me flat. The Broadway set are tactically impressive and great on stage but can lack vocal distinction and a real ... heartfelt style.Not Joe ... Oh, to be sure this guy certainly possess fabulous vocal control and range; but there's no sense of hyper clarity or antiseptic Broadway \"non-style\". Bwarie's emotive style and timing is right up front ... clearly genuine and heartfelt he delivers the emotions that these songs brought when they were rendered by Frank, Dean, Nat, Rosemary, Ella and the other \"coin of the realm\" performers from back in the day.Great stuff, done right...For a debut album from a young talent like Bwarie, I'm taken aback by the quality of this Red Banister Productions LP release. The mastering and recording quality of Nothin' But Love is top drawer but it's the arrangements from Charles Calello that stand apart. At once delicate and elegant, and then big, brassy and spacious ... Calello's charts are delivered beautifully by a 40 piece orchestra highlighted by two jazz musician giants -- the awesome jazz guitar of Bucky Pizzarelli and the masterful Brazilian percussion stylings of Paulinho da Costa. I mean, holy crap ... where does Joe get off snagging this dream team for his debut album!? ;-)The bottom line is that this is a beautiful slice of the American Songbook and a \"gotta have\" LP. The song selection is an interesting weave of  classics with some non-traditional numbers that work great in the standards style they're rendered.The full track list is below but a few favorites from this standout LP start with the first number \"Old Devil Moon\" ... Joe leads out with a classic number that showcases his vocal skill rounded off by the heart of a club singer. This track tees up a great heartfelt performance vibe for the rest of the album.He goes off the beaten path with Calello's swell stage band charted version of the R&B classic \"Stand By Me\", and then drops into the torch classic \"If I Had You\" with wonderfully lilting strings and winds and a neat medley trail out riff of \"It Had To Be You\" ... cool.There's nothing close to a bad track on this LP......and it's hard to carve out favorites from these 13 top drawer songs ... but three numbers do hit a \"next level\" -- \"above the rest\" plateau for me.A sultry, cool and swinging but still mournful \"When The Sun Comes Out\" ... a crazy cool big band medley mashup of Rihanna and Irving Berlin (yes really!) \"Umbrella/A Fella With an Umbrella\", and Frank Loesser's classic \"I've Never Been In Love Before\" are just best of class renditions that show-off the \"greater than the sum\" Bwarie-Calello collaboration in full measure.Irving Berlin and Rihanna ... really? You guys are killing me ... but what a way to go!Nothin' But Love - Joseph Leo Bwarie Track List(VS_Guy ratings: \"+++\" pluses are good; \"~\" for meh to middling;  \"- - -\" minuses are not good)1 Old Devil Moon 3:06 +++ A great start to a great LP2 Stand By Me 4:27 +++ R&B classic brassed up and fun3 If I Had You 4:47 +++ Torchy and mournful but classically rendered and fabulous4 Frenesi 3:23 +++ Bucky Pizzarelli is on every track but gets feature billing here5 I Can't give You Anything But Love 3:49+++6 A Lot of Livin' To Do 3:32 +++ Sammy Davis, Jack Jones ... and now JLB!7 I've Never Been In Love Before 4:18 ++++ Lilting and beautiful strings and winds; superb Bwarie vocals8 Night and Day 3:29 +++ Mr. Sinatra's snapping his fingers to this one ... great tribute to Frank9 When The Sun Comes Out 3:40 ++++ just a great edition of a great song; this song lays perfectly for JLB10 Medley: Umbrella/A Fella With an Umbrella 5:06 ++++ Killing me I say!11 What'll I Do? 4:30 +++ Berlin is unmolested this time ;-) Bucky Pizzarelli's guitar again gets feature treatment12 Falling in Love With Love 3:17 +++ Ah...

{"text": "I discovered Joseph Leo Bwarie as part of my love for the musical Jersey Boys.  I saw the musical for the first time in February 2011 and have been in love ever since.  Joseph Leo Bwarie plays Frankie Valli in the first national tour of Jersey Boys and I have had the great pleasure of seeing him perform and meeting him after the show.  The first time I met him, I told him how much I enjoyed the Jersey Boys Christmas album (on which he sings two songs) and he told me to go get \"Nothin' But Love.\"  Perhaps I was a bit starstruck, but I went home that night and bought the mp3 version of this album.  It is absolutely fantastic.  I listen to it almost every day and frequently on repeat.  His voice is so smooth and wonderful.  It's also incredible how different he sounds when he plays Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys.  I love every song on this album.  My favorites are \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?\" and \"Stand By Me.\"  I also really enjoy \"Umbrella\" which is such a great version of the song.  \"Frenesi\" is really fun and upbeat, and then \"If I Had You\" and \"What'll I Do\" are just beautiful.  JLB mentioned in an interview once that he may do a \"Nothin' But Love\" concert sometime in the future and if he does, I will do everything I can to be there.  I also had the pleasure of seeing him perform at a benefit for Broadway Cares where he sang an awesome version of \"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do.\"  I am a JLB fan for life and can't wait to see his career continue to flourish.  I highly HIGHLY recommend this album to everyone, but especially if you like easy listening and jazz music. The band is pretty incredible on the album also.  It's well worth buying!  And if you are in a city where the first national tour of Jersey Boys is playing, go check him out! The entire touring cast is awesome. Bring your cd with you, and he will sign it after the show if you wait for the cast at the stage door.  He's a very nice guy.  It sounds cheesy, but I really do have \"nothin' but love\" for this album!\n", "val": 0.03691305220127106}

It is amazingly produced, emotionally appealing, and destined to be a classic if it ever gets traction.  Diamonds should be a top radio hit.  My girls absolutely loved the music from first listen and this is a far cry from their normal likes of Taylor Swift!  The musicianship is also incredible.\n", "val": 0.06280163675546646}
{"text": "I have been a huge Falling Up fan since Crashings, and have followed them since then all the way through Fangs, which I liked even though I was disappointed it was so different from the stuff before it. Well, when I saw that they had broken up I was very disappointed. Imagine my excitement, though, when I got on Wikipedia one night and randomly looked them up and saw that they had decided to come back together and make a new album. Well the day of the release of the album came and now a couple weeks later, my money situation has allowed me to be able to get \"Your Sparkling Death Cometh.\" As usual with Falling Up, my expectations were met and exceded. There was not a track I did not like. It was so unique and creative, and not quite like any Christian rock album I have heard, ya know, just like Falling Up. I loved the creativity and the uniqueness of it. Jessy Ribordy's vocals were awesome and the drumming by Josh Shroy also deserves to be mentioned. Though similar to Fangs! in some ways, I though this was so much better than Fangs!. Anyone who is a fan of Falling Up at all should definitely check this album out because it is AWESOME!\n", "val": 0.014663372188806534}
{"text": "I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the case for Your Sparkling Death Cometh. The artwork felt very chilling, without crossing the border into the creepy territory. The paper DigiPak case helped too, as it gave the album a more modern feel than the traditional crystal shells. It's worth noting that when I removed the actual disk from casing, I noticed a line of mirrored text running across the tray. Due to the spiral, it was hard to read, but after a few seconds I successfully deciphered it as \"When will your love unfold your life?\" This becomes slightly more interesting later on, a point which I'll bring up later.Once I finally stopped ogling the case and popped the disk in my computer, I was introduced to the opening track Circadian. It started out slow, with quiet background music. However, at about 55 seconds in, the song went from peacefully resting on the side of the stereo to jumping me, armed with an electric guitar. (Keep in mind that I had cranked it up to hear the quiet sound.) The track feels very fast-paced, with a large focus in instrumentalization. As usual, Jessy Ribordy's (lead singer and Falling Up frontman) signature voice cuts straight through the song, bringing forth both a complex and at times altogether new vocabulary, with words such as \"spidering.\" This song departs us with a musical extro; something which these songs have more often than not.The next track, The Wonder, opens up with the continuation of the extro from the previous track. This song is very wordy, and it only in the chorus does it feel as though the lyrics were composed with the tune in mind. The lyrics, however, are very deep, (\"Electrical lungs can't hold back a beautiful beat that's coursing through my veins, `cause my heart's a perfect wonder\") and the melody is very catchy, using bizarre-but-beautiful time signature combinations.The following piece is entitled Blue Ghost, and was the first single released off of this album in late May. This is probably the most radio-friendly track on this album, but don't let that fact turn you off. The song is very well thought-out, with the melody flowing with the music, creating a unique sort of harmony. The lyrics are moving, and leave no doubt as to where Falling Up's faith lies (\"Tracing lines, your flaws connect the starry skies; He is tracing lines like flashes right before your eyes. Grace comes like a thief in the night; it blooms in the weak and the blind\").The second single from Your Sparkling Death Cometh, Diamnds (Yes, it's actually spelled that way) trails Blue Ghost, following in a similar style as its predecessor. It also has a radio tinge to it, allowing it to feel a bit short, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, as some of these tracks can tend to drag on. The lyrics are the most bluntly \"Christian\" of any found on this album (almost to the point of sounding clich) with the chorus being \"Through the window, I can see Your sun-lit, golden eyes; You've got me so caught up, oh my God.\"The next track, The Light Beam Rider, is one of the strongest on the album. It contains a touching tune which feels reminiscent of the band's work on Captiva, with chillingly deep, spiritual lyrics (\"We are no more than criminals to take what we never had/And across the night there's some criminal who gives what we never had\" and later on \"No greater love comes from all we know, a Grace, like we've never had\").Now here's an interesting track. Remember when I mentioned earlier that the album cover had \"When will your love unfold your life?\" printed on it? Well, at the beginning of Oceans, that very line is chanted/spoken in the background very quietly. The odd part, however, is that the accompanying CD booklet omits that line from the lyrics. Falling Up seems to have done a lot of similar things over their career, so I'm glad they've continued this trend. Overall, Oceans is a softer song, more of a ballad, really. It feels very relaxing, with a strong emphasis on melody. The lyrics are very thoughtful, but kept very short as well (\"If Your heart's an ocean, then I will drown/Beneath the waves, there will be love\").The seventh track on this album, Mscron (no, I have no idea what it means, either) has some of the most intricate lyrics on the album (\"A man walked in the room and sat by his son \"Here are the words that are meant to be spoken. This is my purpose, of these words you should know: ... Remember your life, it was a brilliant color; Remember your mother, she was a glowing ember; Remember your heart, it had a perfect owner.\") The melody, however, is far from perfect, and is probably the most damaging thing score-wise I could critically find on the album. Ribordy also seems to strain his voice a bit on some of the notes. It's just painful to see this song not live up to all it could be.The next track seems to flip the problem. Vates contains a colorful melody; very catchy and strong. The lyrics aren't exactly weak, but they don't make a lot of sense. (\"They looked back to see if I if I was following them, but I never really left at all. And they turned back to scream that I'm the terrible one, but I just finally found my heart\"). Point-in-case.Forms and Shapes follows, holding what I would argue to be the spot for the best track on the album. The music feels very melodic, almost along the lines of Streams of Woe from Falling Up's Fangs!, but this time with a much larger range, both instrumentally and vocally. The lyrics in-and-of themselves don't seem too impressive when read, but when paired with the music, it creates a beautiful, unspoken harmony. Drummer Josh Shroy also gets to show off a bit more on this track, making it a personal favorite. The percussion, instruments, vocals and lyrics all flow together in one heart, creating one of Falling Up's most thought-out, strongest songs ever. (\"You're formed lovely; Mysterious lines have traced you out a beautiful life. It's poor, but resonates the sound of Falling Grace.\")The closing song, Slow Waves, is very short lyrically, and mostly consists of a prolonged extro. The lyrics seem to conclude the album's story, of which Falling Up usually seems to have in all of their records. (\"They had my lungs on machines; their rhythm is pumping air - I'm terrified, but I won't let my hope go. I won't let my heart keep from leaping out; it's leaping out\")After listening to the album, I feel that Falling Up's new future looks very bright. After they broke with their former label, BEC Recordings, and then broke up themselves, it didn't seem like much was left for them. It didn't help that Fangs!' failure lost them a lot of fans. However, after this fan-funded album's release, and what looks to be its success, the independent route may be their greatest ally now. Your Sparkling Death Cometh isn't my favorite album of theirs from a personal standpoint, but it takes the cake artistically, being something incredibly unique and powerful.It also brings a clear-yet-creative view of God's gift of salvation. Lyrics found in songs such as Blue Ghost, The Light Beam Rider and Mscron clearly define Falling Up's faith and commitment to God. You can pull out lyrics from Forms and Shapes which seem to be the anthem of this album: \"You're formed lovely; Mysterious lines have traced you out a beautiful life. It's poor, but resonates the sound of Falling Grace.\" Blue Ghost also shares the theme: \"Tracing lines, your flaws connect the starry skies. He is tracing lines like flashes right before your eyes.\" The overall message of this album, if I were to paraphrase it, and read a bit into it some lyrics, would be that \"God created you in His image, and to Him, you are beautiful. Your imperfections are perfect to Him, and He loves you, regardless of your mistakes.\"I can guarantee you that you won't find a group anywhere near this genre that so proficiently pours out so much talent. Overall, I give this album a 9.5/10; One or two minor disappointments are dwarfed by the overarching creativity and musical talent.\n", "val": 0.008282842114567757}

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.

If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.This song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?And don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check hereFREE MUSIC:From Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n", "val": 0.0066663227044045925}

{"text": "Naoko Yamano of Shonen Knife has worn her Ramones fandom on her sleeve, so it's a bit surprising that a Shonen Knife Ramones tribute album has taken this long to materialize. OSAKA RAMONES should please Ramones fans and Shonen Knife fans alike. SK is not fooling around with their choice of songs for this release: they are all rockers! I like the way Ramones songs have been turned into Shonen Knife songs with their signature pop/punk sound. And: I must say that after all these years of \"family-friendly\" SK material, it's highly amusing to hear Naoko singing the lyrics to such drug-soaked titles as PSYCHO THERAPY and CHINESE ROCK. The disc wraps up with the Ramones classic PINHEAD, which includes original background voices from the Ramones version...a nice touch. My only real complaint here is that OSAKA RAMONES is too short at barely over a half hour. But, as we know, a half hour is enough for quite a few Ramones songs. SK's versions are well performed, and this release marks the CD debut of Shonen Knife's newest member, drummer Emi Morimoto. Emi fits in well, and hopefully the band will now remain stable for a while. Kudos to Naoko, Ritsuko and Emi for another diverting Shonen Knife album!\n", "val": 0.022419361397624016}

The Chorus for Get it Daddy really reminded me of old vintage Misfits, which I am a sucker for...so I had to try them.I have to say the entire album is VERY solid. If you like the single...you will like the entire album.What I really like is that Track 9 \"Some White Blinds\" really shows that these guys can show their teeth when they want to...it's got a little bite to it. I really hope when they release a follow-up they will put a few more harder ones like this one on the disc.If you have been longing for some original music that does not reek of mainstream garbage...give this a try.

{"text": "I hate them.  They look like rejects from one of those artsy-fartsy, black-and-white Levi's commercials.  They sound like Joan Jett and The Pixies got lost in a closet with a big pile of coke, and they're stuff is so full of la-las and ooh-oohs that I can barely stand it.  But the thing that really, truly pisses me off is that this is, most likely, the album of the year.The Bowling Green, Kentucky-based, Sleeper Agent, is having the collective time of it's life on the debut record, Celabrasion.  The record is so effortlessly brilliant that it's mere existence turns me envious shades of green that range from avacado to chartreuse.  They pull every dirty trick in the rock catch-phrase book, churning out riff after riff, filling out their vocal lines with group shouts and sing-alongs that make Weezer's Pinkerton seem like 'just another record.'Alright, I may be going overboard here, but this record is tighter than tight.  Alex Kandel's vocals are youthful yet raw, as she leads her group of rock misfits through a merciless, infectious set.  Starting from the get go, \"Get It Daddy\" the post-punk meter is topped-out with half-time break-downs, syncopated verses and a catchy-as-hell chorus.  \"Force a Smile\" and \"Get Burned\" are brilliant, melodic, furious pop-tunes with all the appeal of an indie act like Tuscadero or The Dambuilders.  Things get a bit more raw on the relatively mid-tempo \"Suga Cane,\" \"Some White Blinds\" and \"Proper Taste\" sounding like Joan Jett or even Boss Hog, while \"Love Blood\" smacks of late-era Weezer, remaining catchy with a bit more novelty.  But \"Bottomed Out\" begins as a Replacements-style bar rock tune but softens into a more dulcet chorus.  \"That's My Baby\" and \"All Wave and No Goodbye\" have a retro, sweet ballad feel with vocals being split with singer/guitarist Tony Smith (who bears a striking, sonic resemblance to Pixies vocalist Frank Black).  \"Be My Monster\" continues on the sick, awe-inspired punk-pop tip, with a Carribean break-down thrown in.And geezus, it just keeps going and going.  I don't know what they put in the water in Bowling Green, but damn I want some.  I'd say that the real test for this six-piece is yet to come, but it has me giggling like a drunk teenager, regardless.  If Celabrasion is the only record we get from this Southern, post-punk, septet, we'll be thankful, anyways.  Celabrasion is one of those divinely inspired, pop masterpieces, that will garner praise for years to come.  That is, if the air/video waves ever find out.-Miles Christopher (a.k.a.

{"text": "Sleeper Agent.  A band I discovered through Cage the Elephant, with whom they share the home town of Bowling Green, Kentucky. As Cage are one of my favorite bands at the moment, I was thankful that their musical recommendation didn't disappoint.The album comprises of 12 fairly simple tracks, bursting with melody, hooks and brightness. The band's vocal responsibility lies with Alex Kandal and Tony Smith (also guitar); a boy-girl team up which perfectly compliments the poppy, high-energy music, courtesy of Justin Wilson (drums), Lee Williams (bass), Josh Martin (Guitar) and Scott Gardner (keys).  If you like indie style outfits with a pop edge, you will more than likely be on the right street with Sleeper Agent, I can't say enough as to just how likeable they are.  The only reason I knocked a star off is because Sleeper Agent are part of a scene which has become frankly monotonous and in general this album isn't anything groundbreaking, but they are still a shining light.  Personal highlights for me are the ridiculously catchy \"Force a smile\" and the most edgy song on the album \"These white blinds\".

I can't argue with any of them - because this album really is that crazy good with that many different fun songs - any of which might be your favorite...  whether it's the first big single \"Get It Daddy\", \"Shuga Cane,\" \"Love Blood,\" \"That's My Baby,\", or \"Be My Monster\"... or I haven't even mentioned my favorite \"All Waves and No Goodbyes\" which is a softer track stuck all the way near the end, and contains one of my all-time favorite song lyrics (or at least a favorite of recent years).  The lyric:  \"I'm gonna make you believe in me/Gonna make you believe in me/(But you can't make me make up your damn mind)\"...

{"text": "I saw this record compared in a review to the Ramones, Cheap Trick, and Elastica, all favorites of mine, so, based on only that review, I picked up Celabrasion.  It's not like the Ramones, Cheap Trick, or Elastica.  Celabrasion has good riffs and melodies, but there are several songs in which disparate ideas seem like they've been forced together.  Songs by the Ramones, Cheap Trick, and Elastica are coherent and different sections of their songs flow more seamlessly.  The abrupt shifts work on Get It Daddy, the opening track of Celabrasion, but when it happens a couple more times in later tracks, I found myself thinking, stick with one idea and see it through to the end.Another feature that makes it difficult for me to listen to Celabrasion for very long is the recording of the vocals.  On all but a couple tracks, the vocals are distorted and doubled up throughout the songs.  It's a cool gimmick on one or two songs, but it becomes tiresome to listen to on almost every track.  Again, the Ramones, Cheap Trick, and Elastica occasionally used extreme processing on their vocals, but more often it was almost unnoticeable and the character of the singer comes through.  It is distracting on Celabrasion.  Many of the songs would come across better and with even more raw energy if they had cleaner vocals.I like the energy and attitude behind Celabrasion and I would take a chance on a follow-up record from Sleeper Agent because I think they've got the right idea and they're headed in the right direction, but Celabrasion doesn't hit 5 stars for me.\n", "val": 6.427707558032125e-05}

{"text": "If you want this spiritually rapt Requiem chirped as if a yellow smiley face has been pasted across it, here you go. But I hear no emotional depth in this performance. To me, the Faure Requiem is an exercise in spiritual chiaroscuro. It's about the darkness being penetrated by the light; but it's the light of stained glass casting itself across the dark shadows of an awesome cathedral. Pale, little boy wannabes in the soprano section can't make that happen. Neither can all the smooth, rounded edges of Rutter's approach. Robert Shaw was a little square in spots, but the Atlanta recording on Telarc is one of his best. Laurence Equilbey's Accentus chamber choir does a beautiful job with the Requiem, though a few more cuddles from the soprano section might have been nice. Herreweghe also gave us a good one. He may have period tendencies, but there's far more depth to the performance than you'll ever find here. There's nothing unpleasant about Rutter's offering, but it leaves out the intensity that makes the piece special.\n", "val": 0.00421121483668685}

I just don't find his requiem to be more than pleasant churchy sort of singing in general.  No cajones like Verdi put into his.  This is done by a smaller chamber-size orchestra, and I thought that would diminish the overblown orchestral portions I react negatively to in other recordings...not so.  Just elevator music with a classical bent.  Well, sorry if this puts anyone off from purchasing, but go to YouTube and see if it's there and decide for yourself.\n", "val": 6.311463221209124e-05}

{"text": "I first heard this recording when it first appeared in 1984 and was a pioneering account because it was the first recording of the 1893 chamber orchestra edition which John Rutter had rediscovered in the Bibliotech National in Paris.The version of the Requiem that most people had hitherto heard was the full orchestral version in 1900, that was probably undertaken by Jean Roger-Ducasse, one of Faure's pupils. This final version had 2 flutes, 2 clarinets, 3 trombones and a full complement of violins, which were not in the 1893 version on this recording. Instead of massed violins, there is a solitary violin in the 1893 orchestration.The effect of listening to this version is a bit like listening to Handel's Messiah on original instruments. There is not the same bassiness of sound or portentous weight but something much more airy and intimate, just listen to the soaring solo violin passage in the Sanctus played an octave higher than in the usual version. There is weightiness in the Libera Me section and gorgeous horn sonorities in the Agnus Dei. It was so relevatory that Gramophone Magazine made it a record of the year when it first came out.28 years on, how does it stand up? I have enjoyed hearing this recording again but on reflection, I do find it sounds rather too 'English' in presentation and I longed to hear some more bite. I think this is a very correct, very musical performance but I do want to hear more engagement with the material. The soprano soloist Caroline Ashton sounds sweetly choirboyish and the baritone, Stephen Varcoe's voice is a little grey. However, I think it was a very worthwhile venture and I am sure that there are other recordings of this version of the Requiem that have been recorded.\n", "val": 0.00245781522244215}

{"text": "This disc, first issued in 1984, focusses on a recording of the second of three versions Faure made of his Requiem. The first did not include two of the movements and was written for a smaller orchestra without violins, horns or trumpets. The second version from 1893 and recorded here incorporated these extra instruments in a limited but telling way and also included the Offertoire and Libera Me missing from the first version. The third, and most often performed version was for full orchestra and larger choir.The performance here uses the small orchestra as required by Faure and this is matched by a small choir of very great purity of tone. The horns have a small but vital role in the climax to the Libera me. This is far more effective than in many more opulent versions simply because of the contrast created between so little and then relatively so much. The important treble solo in the Pie Jesu is taken by solo soprano Caroline Ashton who sings with such a clarity that it is very hard to imagine that she is not a treble of great tonal quality and surety. The baritone soloist, Stephen Varcoe, sings his solo well.The Cantique de Jean Racine is an early work of Faure written when he was just 20 winning him first prize in a competition. It has justifiably remained popular ever since. The remaining works on the disc are of similar quality but it will be for the Requiem that this disc is chosen.I would suggest that, like John Rutter believes, this is the finest of the three settings created by Faure. As such it has strong claims on collectors and this is one of the finest performances of that setting made. The recording portrays its ethereal quality perfectly. A sublime disc in every way.\n", "val": 0.02214721404016018}

The only issue, and a BIG issue, is how MAKES everyone go through the Amazon Music player just to download the music THAT SHOULD OF BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR COMPUTER IN THE FISRT PLACECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR!!!IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE why in the world they feel the need to make you jump through all kinds of hoops simply to get WHAT YOU BOUGHT!!! *People simply want to download it to their computer no strings attached!!* ***This is the most useless hassle I have ever come across in dealing with WHAT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE and straight forward task such as downloading the music you just bought***I have NEVER met anyone that goes out of their wallet to buy music and prefers it to keep it on a stream player app on their computer-_-  If it was like that they would just keep listening to it on youtube.Its like the most ANNOYING, USELESS \"middle man\" there could possibly be. If anyone is PAYING for ANYTHING digital it should be a really BASIC-COMMON SENSE LOGIC that they want it on their computer.and not have it rely on a stupid music stream application where they have to change a bunch of settings JUST TO GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  The MOST idiotic thing is that they don't even give you a choice to download it straight to your computer after you buy itit HAS to go through this useless process.  The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!  AND on top of that you have to deal with TONS of annoying bugs and glitches, some of which makes you completely stuck, even after re-opening the app, and often makes you have to just completely re-install the it.***It should be a given that if you purchase a song and select it to download that you *DO_NOT* want it to go directly to some pain in the butt software that for 1, is ALWAYS has some type of super annoying bug and 2, is purely a unnecessary and just a straight up hassle.***  For the pathetic amazon music player I give it 1 star, if I could I would give it a -5 score rating.

{"text": "Having just gotten burned by wasting two bucks on an early Brubeck (\"At Storyville\") with wretched, amateurish audio, I was braced for the worst when it came to hearing my other purchases of Amazon's bargain-priced albums.  Fortunately, the Brubeck album was apparently an aberration: the sound on this Clifford Brown session is better than I had a right to expect.Listening to Clifford is to discover--with all due deference to Pops, Diz, Miles--the greatest trumpeter the music has known.  Like Scottie LaFaro, the bassist who was so instrumental toward the construction, along with Bill Evans, of a new jazz piano trio sound, Clifford left us at the age of 25 and was no less seminal than LaFaro.  Moreover, both musicians--unlike a Louis Armstrong or Jimmy Blanton--continue to represent not so much a breakthrough or revolutionary \"first step\" aa standard that almost 60 years later few if any successors have been able to equal let alone surprass.Clifford didn't indulge himself in the \"tricks\" of his peers and successors--Harmon mutes, bent trumpet bells, wah wah pedals wired to the horn, half-valving, acrobatic trills--all were foreign to him--and of no use: he was an artist whose only language was about the creation of truth and beauty.  Or, to phrase it differently, Clifford was a pure \"Romantic\"--his formidable, unequaled technique always subservient to a \"musical idea\" that owed more to a vibrant, \"living\" tone and unapologetic melodicism than to any of the device employed by other musicians to be \"different\" or \"identifiable.\"The playing of Herb Geller is simply another reason to pick up this recording.  A musician who's remained in Germany for much of the past half century, he shows he was far more than another West Coast player of the \"cool school\": on this recording, he places himself squarely in the tradition of Charlie Parker--as much a direct descendent of Bird as Sonny Stitt, Phil Woods, or Cannonball Adderley.[This performance practically demands comparison with an album of the same title by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Caravan-Keepnews-Collection/dp/B000PY30K8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Caravan: Keepnews Collection</a>.  You may save a few bucks by getting the original Riverside issue instead of the recently remastered one by Orrin Keepnews.  Either way, it's an instructive--and exhilarating--opportunity to compare the trumpets of Clifford and Freddie Hubbard as well as the percussion work of two thunder-bearers: Max Roach and Art Blakey.  And if you're into earth-moving music, compare the work of Buddy Rich on the same tune, from:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Blues-Caravan-Dig/dp/B0007KVAL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Blues Caravan (Dig)</a>, which also features blazing solo work by flutist Sam Most, trumpeter Rolf Erickson and vibist Mike Mainieri.  This neglected performance represents, imo, some of Rich's most creative work on record.  Besides an opening drum solo, Buddy comes back for another solo while former Brubeck bassist, Wyatt Ruther, outlines the chord sequence with strong walking 4/4 (I only wish more percussionists would opt for the same combination--drum solos are little more than acrobatic displays--unless the percussionist's contributions arise from the musical elements of the tune .  Buddy's solos on his two most famous \"vehicles\"--\"West Side Story Suite\" and \"Channel One Suite\"--could be exchanged or inserted in just about any uptempo tune.  His playing on \"Caravan\" and Horace Silver's \"Blowin' the Blues Away,\" on the other hand, is a striking, \"musical\" exception.[Explanation of my title: while I'm still having a bit more trouble with Amazon's Cloud than with Apple's, I've managed, with patience, to play the tunes I've purchased from Amazon on 2 computers and 3 hand-held devices.  Be sure to download \"Cloud Player\" from Amazon or iTunes, and the rest is automatic--more or, as is often the case, less.  And even if you prefer \"real\" records (LPs, CDs) to ethereal downloads, you've got to admit that being able to juxtapose trumpet players or drummers is greatly expedited by programs like iTunes and Cloud Player.]\n", "val": 0.00010237142123514786}

{"text": "This is one of the most energetic albums to come from the Brown and Roach collaboration. Caravan, as performed by the ensemble, is at a tempo that I am sure was never envisioned by Juan Tizol and Duke Ellington when they wrote it. That it maintains that tempo and sense of energy for over fifteen minutes is a marvel in itself, but the real treat is Brown whose tone any ability to articulate every note at the tempo is why he will always be remembered as one of the greatest trumpeters ever born.Autumn in New York has long been one of my personal favorite tunes, with Billie Holiday's rendition at the top of my list. This rendition is my second favorite. Brown's intro and one exquisite chorus after another provides 21 minutes of sheer joy.As I write this review the album is playing in the background. A single word comes to mind: serendipity. I had discovered this gem back in February while searching for something else, and immediately purchased it solely on the basis of Clifford Brown's participation.

{"text": "Five MARVELOUS Stars! This is a legendary recording that came from trumpet genius Clifford Brown's 1954 west coast tour with pre-eminent drummer Max Roach, and has an all-star reed and rhythm section consisting of Herb Geller on alto sax, Joe Maini on alto sax, Walter Benton on tenor sax, Curtis Counce on bass and Kenny Drew on piano. The photograph on the related&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Best-Coast-Jazz/dp/B000068W1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Best Coast Jazz</a>&nbsp;LP, which was recorded at the same time, shows the intense group of Clifford, Joe, Walter, and Herb in a semi-circle around one microphone with Max Roach's drums nearby, but the jam session sound is excellent with everything clearly audible. With Max Roach relentlessly driving the group along with 'drum major' figurations and variations, Duke Elllington's \"Caravan\" is a monster performance where EmArcy Records just let the tape run without edit and each song took up an entire side of a 33 1/3 LP. My favorite parts are Roach's masterful 'boiler works' drumming, Herb Geller's fiery solo which has Roach yelling approval, as he does for Brown's, plus Maini and Barrow are also on their solo 'A game'. One can only imagine what a thrill it was for these west coast aces to play with Brown and Roach, and vice versa. The performances here and on the inventive, relaxed ballad \"Autumn In New York\" which also has some superb solos, especially Clifford and Herb and Joe, both live up to the expectations of a great jam session. It is said \"Best Coast Jazz\" was released prior to Clifford Brown's death at age 25 in a traffic accident and \"Clifford Brown All-Stars\" was a posthumous release. With Mr Brown's death, the Clifford Brown 'school' of jazz trumpet later came to fruition with the arrival of heavyweights like Freddie Hubbard and Lee Morgan. This recording is a \"must have\" in any comprehensive jazz collection, and now finally available in mp3 format, (and admittedly there are other combinations of these songs available) it is easy to download at a great price indeed.

If you can't stand rap music, because of the use of profanity, glorification of violence, degrading women, etc., and you'd rather just hear some really great ongoing beats and instrumentation, then you've got to get this CD. Plus, the tracks are long enough so that you can get into them. I hope Oddisee keeps this quality of music going. The music industry, especially the rap/hip hop industries, desparately needs a more positive and inclusive contribution. If you like great hip hop groups like The Roots, A Tribe Called Quest, or even the samples and beats used by Wu Tang's debut projects, then you'll probably enjoy this CD.

{"text": "I've been a fan of trailer music for a long time and enjoyed Thomas's work in Two Steps from Hell as well as that of  similar artists such as The Immediate. This is my favorite album of the Epic Music genre. Thomas works in a lot of different emotions  and character in these songs, and with nineteen songs, there's something for everyone.Musically speaking, what stands out in Illusions is the use of fantastic female vocalists that will send a shiver down your spine. Latin-type choirs are here, as well, but more judiciously applied than in some of the other trailer-type music that tends to overdo it. Thomas employs  pulsing strings, heroic horns, and driving beats, and he uses these to create story-scapes in your mind.Stand out tracks: Starvation (feels like you're in a mine with scrawny slave children), Ocean Princess (standing on a cliff watching a mighty, rescuing ship pull into view), Homecoming (you've died and gone to heaven. Chills every time. Great medicine for a bad mood), Immortal (a warrior cleaning up on the battlefield) and Age of Gods (Heroes facing down the hordes. The mirroring of the horn and latin choir at the beginning are chill inducing).There are no bad tracks on the album. Even the ones with a softer touch (Remember Me and Hurt) are a fun listen. Nine bucks is a ridiculously low amount to pay for this much quality music, so enjoy.\n", "val": 0.016649913042783737}
{"text": "Well sort of.  Thomas Bergersen has composed for the trailer music company Two Steps from Hell for a few years, but this is his first solo album.  It's amazing regardless.What makes this different from Invincible and upcoming Nero, is that it is very themed.  Rather than a random selection of the most popular songs.  It doesn't feel like it's jumping between styles.  It's subtly grand with a hint of epicness the whole way through.  It's not Two Steps From Hell, but it's still very good.  I wouldn't say that it's better or worse, because it's a different kind of style, but fear not, it still maintains the powerful orchestra.It's also really nice that the album is only $9.  There are 19 songs, and considering the songs span from 3 (mostly 4) to 8 minutes, it makes for a really good deal.  And quite honestly, there isn't a single bad song on Illusions.  This is one of the albums that you'll listen to several times. Another nice thing about it, is the will probably take decades before it's considered \"timed'.  For pretty much the same reasons that soundtracks are remembered for so long.  I wouldn't be surprised if Thomas Bergersen started scoring for movies and games.\n", "val": 0.03346208855509758}

Unlike Invincible, which has plenty of escape-from-evil/chase type sequences, Illusions has more of a 'motivational-epic' feel with interludes of beauty and even tenderness, giving the listener the sense of embarking on a heroic quest.

It's the soundtrack for an epic movie that isn't written, makes you want to produce your own movie, and is great to have on in the background for just about any task you're doing.I would say this music sounds very much like Hans Zimmer's work.

{"text": "For the unaware, Thomas Bergerson is a composer who formed a partnership with fellow composer Nick Phoenix to start the company Two Steps from Hell specifically to produce music for music and video game trailers.  Their resume is too long to list.  Lets just say if you've seen any movie trailers for big budget movies in the past five years you have probably been exposed to some of their work.This disk isn't Two Steps from Hell.  It's just Thomas and his music.  The inside cover of Illusions carries a message from Thomas.  He said that over the past three years whenever he felt he had written something especially special he saved it for this disk.He was right.  This disk is filled with nothing but truly extraordinary music.  It is easily better than Skyworld, Archangel, or Invincible.  Please don't mistake that last statement as criticism of those three albums.  To compare by analogy, if those three were beer they would be Rochefort 6, 8 and 10 respectively.  Illusions is Westveletran 12.  If you're not a beer nut that's like comparing Colt Pythons from the 1970s, 1960s, and 1950s to a Korth.  If you're not a gun nut then I'm running out of suitable comparisons.  Lets just leave it at the work he and Nick did with Two Steps from Hell is phenomenal and Illusions is much, much better.If you are still unsure about buying this disk, step on over to Youtube and do a search.

David Murphy, author of a new book called&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Chronicles-of-Good-and-Evil-Dracula-s-Lair-The-Chronicles-Series/dp/B00AM6GY98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Chronicles of Good and Evil - Dracula's Lair (The Chronicles Series)</a>&nbsp;Such an unbelievable resonation of sound & music (with few exceptions)that the listener can discover a personal distinction to interpret the music with. There is simply something for everyone here.I am somewhat new to the 'trailer musical' genre. But with an intuitive ear to the nature of how music evokes an emotional and perhaps, spiritual sense, this collection tops them all. It truly is, by and large, a masterpiece of musical difference, supreme qualities, powerful scores, reaching heights of emotional ambiance and the depths of feelings that can greatly move you.Bergersen is truly a master at crafting the temporal stage for his profound music - the scope and mood to which speaks to each listener differently and in the most intimate way...I have my favorites, as many would; some of which might be different than what you would discover for yourself... My descriptions come from what I felt, and what book scenes were catapulted by this music - so keep this in mind when reading through each track.But here are a few:Track 2 - Starvation - a powerful, engaging piece that draws the listener in with a slow, cautious flair until the full thrust of the music reaches to its more aggressive performanceTrack 7 - Rada - the seamless use of strings from the very start rises and elevates this musical score like nothing I've ever heard. I utilized this piece again and again to 'inspire' many dramatic scenes in my book. The gallactic battle between good and evil / heaven and hell / Satan and God are incredibly captured in this masterpiece..Track 9 - Merchant Prince - begins with a slight, somber overture (as its appeal for the Flight of `Chronicles' legion angels after discovering the devastation caused by Dracula and his forces). The horror they felt is aptly captured in the start of this piece, which moves into the lingering wail of souls, evolving into the triumph of knowing their purpose and what they must overcome to accomplish their mission.Track 10 - Promise - starts with the movements of a single chello, the hopeful chords of a piano, the flight of an angelic voice, the rush of strings, the ascension of angel's wings... A diverse piece that is filled with hope and the endurance of our collective, human spirit...Track 11 - Femme Fatale - A dramatic, gallactic score with a combination of winds, strings, choral brought together in the end, much like a marching hymn of defiance...Track 12 - Homecoming - a tender, emotional score that truly the longing for a home left behind, and the desire to someday return to it....Track 14 - Remember Me - a spectacular, moving piece. I've rarely heard anything remotely similar to this piece. A deep, provocative, yearning musical score that simply will pull you in. Performed in two identical cycles with one exception - the second versing is partnered with the most angelic voice - which gives this piece incredible beauty. It is one of my two favorites on this track. I call this the romantic overture score...Track 16 - Reborn - Simply my favorite piece... An epic, mastering tightrope between illusion and reality. Nothing beats this with its intensity. If my book were ever made into a movie, this would be the opening score for it. The use of strings, the parading burst for winds; the driven notations on keyboard - all brought together in the end by this tremendous ensemble. An incredible musical score!Track 17 - Age of Gods - entails in appropriate fashion the nearly apocalyptic scene where Gabriel / Satan confront one another for the first time after many millenniums.This is one of the best, if not the best soundtrack/trailer score I've ever purchased. Well worth the purchase price. Many other scores only give you one or two, maybe three tracks that stick out; ones that you are drawn to - the variety here will keep you listening for some time to come.If I have one piece of advice for Thomas Bergersen, please come out with more compilations like this!It's truly a masterpiece for which the masters of old (Wagner, Beethoven, etc) would be most proud of...\n", "val": 0.020970730111002922}

{"text": "Though it is by a composer for Two Steps From Hell, do not expect to hear \"Invincible\" or \"Archangel\" on here. It's epic, to be sure, but very different from the standard epic trailer music. It has a more pronounced mid-evil feeling (See \"Soulseeker\"), a very foreign/tribal/old-world sounding vocal style (see \"Starvation\" and \"Merchant Prince\") and significant techno influence on a couple (\"Aura\" and \"Illusions\") I'm not a particular fan of the aforementioned vocal style, though I can still appreciate it well enough in the context of this music. The album has good variance, going around between the three aspects I've mentioned in varying degrees, so that Soulseeker sounds very different from Merchant Prince sounds from Aura, and yet the album still feels like it has a particularly unique identity. For the most part, I'm not blown away by this album but I in no way regret the purchase. \"Ilusions,\" however, the title track is worth particular mention. Incredibly long at 8:01 (largely repeating itself once over), Illusions itself is a good poster child as it is incredibly unique, combining an interesting vocal style AND a more traditional epic chorus (If you're a two steps fan, think \"United we Stand\"), along with \"wubs\" and techno base used surprisingly tastefully.  As an epic track it feels melancholy and desperate; not as a depressing, tragic piece but as a desperate, epic journey - and with its length it has notable tone changes, making for a good ride.So it's far from my favorite album, but it's an interesting change of pace within the genre and a solid album with a clear identity.\n", "val": 0.017716001719236374}

{"text": "Words cannot begin do describe how well-crafted, diverse, and simply phenomenal this album is.  Thomas Bergersen has truly created a masterpiece in modern-classical music!  The range of emotions that Mr. Bergersen fleshes out is massive and swings from one end of the spectrum to the other so seamlessly that it seems like each song is a piece to a grand musical puzzle.  The best example of this is hearing the intensity and darkness of Femme Fatale followed immediately by the heavenly and uplifting them of Homecoming.  Having said that, each piece is still amazing on their own.Apart from the use of a large variety of instruments from around the world, the excellent placement of electronic sounds (Reborn and Promise), and his ability to keep an 8-minute song interesing to the end (Aura and Illusions), what really drives the music is the amazing group of female vocalists that Mr. Bergersen uses throughout the majority of the album.  All of the vocalists do an incredible job of lifting the music to new heights and when backed by a coed choir and a male vocalist in Sonera, some amazing vocal moments are produced (e.g. Ocean Princess and Promise).  However, they are also more than capable of leading the song without a choir behind them as shown by the songs Remember Me and Dreammaker.My only issue with this album is that I cannot find the english translations to any of the songs.  I would assume that the lyrics are amazing, but I simply do not know what the translations are.  If anybody knows where the lyrics can be found, please let me know because I would love to find them.  Otherwise, I would give my highest recommendation in buying this album.  Over a short period of time, \"Illusions\" has certainly become my favorite of all time!  Since I bought this album and Two Steps From Hell's \"Invincible\" I have searched the web to find other music similar to this (Trailer Music, Modern-classical, whatever you may call it) but none of it quite reaches the bar set by Thomas Bergersen's \"Illusions\".  I am excited to see how Thomas Bergersen's repertoire of music will evolve as time passes.P.S.  This is my first review and I would like to hear comments and opinions on this review.

{"text": "If you're looking for music that evokes a feeling of hopefulness, of transcending time and space, of fearlessness, of love, then you should buy this cd.  I came across Thomas Bergersen after hearing the track on this cd called \"Sonera\" on a trailer for a movie called \"Cloud Atlas\".  That 5 minute trailer exposed me to such music that I knew immediately that I had to have it.  I couldn't just find that track on some website and just download it.  I felt that I had to support the man who created it.  I have come to love the entire cd.  This is something that rarely happens.  So, would I recommend this album?  Yes, a million times yes.\n", "val": 0.014084974303841591}
{"text": "After discovering Thomas Bergersen online, I immediately fell in love with his music. This whole album is a success. Each song is a masterpiece of epic classical music, similar to something you would hear in a movie trailer, but much expanded upon. In my opinion, each song tells its own story in a unique and beautiful melding of melodies. For such high quality music and so much of it in one album (19 tracks, roughly 75 minutes of music), this album is very affordable and worth it. For those who are fans of Two Steps From Hell, this is somewhat different from the duo's work, but not at all worse and definitely a must buy. I don't regret my purchase at all and cannot wait for the next album to be released (if there will be one).\n", "val": 0.048554759472608566}

{"text": "Thomas Bergersen's album \"Illusions\" is a must for lovers of the 'trailer music' or 'epic music' style. His songs in this album are not all one uniform speed or crashing style. Illusions maintains an excellent variety of songs which range from ones that start dramatic and only grow from there (such as 'Age of Gods') while also having songs such as 'Remember Me,' which starts off far slower with light piano which only eventually grows into a swelling end.The voices in this album focus primarily around a strong chorus and stunningly beautiful female solo singers. The exception to this is the song 'Sonera,' which features a male/female duet (which is also gorgeous).The price--$7.99 for nineteen (NINETEEN) songs is mind-blowing, especially because most of these songs are not just 1-minute sample-style tunes but full, rich tunes.Bottom line: this album is a masterpiece, and should be treated as such.

Every offering is unlike the other and evokes a gamut of emotions.  I am blown away by the complexities of these arrangements and their ability to take me away to someplace where I can close my eyes and let my imagination roam where it will.

{"text": "Thomas Bergersen's \"Illusions\" is a pleasure to listen to--at turns epic, symphonic, haunting and ethereal.  It's rare that I'm just enthralled by an album, but this one did the trick.  My favorite track is \"Age of the Gods,\" which is aptly titled and seems to be the most popular download from the album on iTunes.  (Give the sample a listen on Amazon's player.)Bergersen is known for his music with the movie trailer music company \"Two Steps From Hell\"--\"trailer music,\" by the way, is the epic, compelling music that you hear in trailers for upcoming attractions, and it's designed to make you want to see the film being advertised.  It's usually shorter and more complete than the longer pieces found on soundtrack albums, which often include compositions designed for a particular movie scene that may not be pleasing to listen to on their own.  Bergersen's work in \"Illusions\" goes a step beyond the epic trailer music genre and aspires to be something more like classical world music.  It seems to me that Bergersen has succeeded.For those who like visual settings for their music, I have a suggestion that I stumbled across:  If you have an iPad, download \"Illusions\" onto it, then download a free music player app called \"Planetary\" and listen to \"Illusions\" while watching the app.  You may enjoy the result--I certainly did.If you are looking for other examples of Bergersen's work, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Invincible/dp/B005K15XR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Invincible</a>&nbsp;,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Archangel/dp/B005OC6A9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Archangel</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Human-Experience-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture/dp/B004U83SM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Human Experience (Music From The Motion Picture)</a>, to which Bergersen contributed several tracks.

{"text": "\"Yeah, well... there's the ultimate `production record,'\" was my first thought, upon first hearing this. (A \"production record,\" of course, is anything built ENTIRELY behind the board.) ANYBODY could have sung the vox, in other words... ANYBODY could have built the drum-track on any old laptop, ANYBODY could have built the bass line with a phlanger add-in to Reason -- and ANYBODY could have the mixed the whole thing with PT on any old PC in anybody's basement.The truth is, however, that the track NOT a by-the-numbers piece from RedOne's assembly line - and that's a very cool thing indeed: it is, instead, a self-crafted little gem from a duo straight out of nowhere, Colorado. Yeah, it SOUNDS (initially) like a crunk-core version of any other production record; it has every hallmark of every other major-label McCookie McCutter record-of-the-moment (which will be history the very moment that THIS PARTICULAR SPLIT-SECOND passes the world by) - BUT THIS ONE HAS SOMETHING ELSE: this one has THAT EXACT AND SPECIFIC something else; that special, intoxicating, can't-quite-put-your-finger-on-it THANG that hits just the right mix of jarring yet cool and yet utterly NEW genre-mashing... that THANG which leads to monster hit records -- which, ultimately, turn-out to be so massive that they lead to the direct creation of entirely new sub-genres within modern pop.It's THAT damn huge.BLACKOUT is simply ALL KINDS of massive.Breathe Carolina mix electronica with post-hardcore; they mix autotune with vocorder while screaming vox into the red. In other words, they break EVERY rule. \"Um, yeah... guys, that's not supposed to work.\" It DOES, though: it works PERFECTLY. And that's the crux: they mix clean with unclean vocals AND EFFECTS; they mix all of those exact and specific things which AIN'T SUPPOSED TO WORK AT MASS MARKET ON THE BIG CHART AT ALL. They take EVERY musical risk, is what I'm trying to say; they take EVERY wrong turn and almost dare the song to fall apart, and, oh man... is it EVAR cool. I mean, it's just hella HELLA cool... it's just all kinds of goddang awesome. In other words, what they have here is something that every label on Earth is constantly searching for, and yet so rarely find: A sound that is blazingly unique, blindingly frigging original, and ooooohhh-sooooo-insanely-commercial. You can almost SMELL the platinum.Blackout is a MONSTER. As I write this, the song has yet to chart, anywhere. I heard the track on middle-of-the-night Minnesota radio, and I could hardly imagine the jing this thing will pull, like a magnet, from iTunes. It IS, simply, the record of the year. I can't even count the possible ringtones in this thing; there's gotta be at least a hundred Million worth of ringtone$ in Blackout. It's the edgiest thing to hit the big chart (WHEN it hits, that is) in a good long while... the style is BRAZEN; the record is a textbook on FLAIR. It's just gripping, man... the band rips through its chorii like Bon Jovi on steroids. It's anthemic, and you just can't turn it off. Even after it ends, you find yourself turning-off the radio just to re-listen, in your head, to what you've just heard.It's the Bay City Rollers doing Linkin Park covers -- as if they were produced by RedOne and mixed by Bob Rock.Absolutely MASSIVE.Good God, just MASSIVE.\n", "val": 0.000347284774761647}

I actually bought their album for the song \"The Words I Would Say\" because, at the time, it was my favorite song on the radio and I expected good things.Unfortunately, iTunes genius buried the rest of the album because I didn't have \"enough similar music\" on my system.  Actually, they're a new enough group, iTunes doesn't know enough about who they are.  In any case, I didn't hear \"You Love Me Anyway\" until a few weeks ago on the radio, fell in love with the song, and set out to find it.When iTunes told me \"you already own this\" I was dumbfounded.  Here was this amazing song, with an amazing message, sitting on my iPod with 0 in the play count!Now that it's properly rated and placed in my \"Awesome Music\" playlist, it gets plenty of earbud air time.\"You Love Me Anyway\" is a fantastic song with a very uplifting message of grace, love, and compassion.  For anyone who ever feels the faintest note of guilt in their life, this song brings hope and relief.  The bridge in particular will speak to just about everyone, no matter where you happen to be in your life.  It's the most powerful song I've heard so far this year, and I'm sure that power won't wane with the coming years.\n", "val": 0.014717674814164639}

{"text": "If you ever liked The Outfield before, then put RePlay on the \"Buy Now\" list. This new release from the band's original members exudes all the familiar sounds of yesteryear in a fresh, slick production. It starts with the rockin' \"Aladdin's Cave,\" and follows with a smooth, drive-with-the-top-down \"California Sun.\" But the best part of the album comes next- my personal favorite, \"Long, Long Time Ago\" and later, \"Who Would You Be,\" a song that is sure to have you put an \"L\" to your forehead come chorus- and concert- time (you'll understand when you listen to it). Though Replay loses just a little steam toward the end, you will enjoy its content thoroughly. There are sprinklings of other bands' influence here, from early Police to The Beatles to Cream. I find it similar in overall quality to Voices of Babylon, perhaps the group's finest work. What really helps most in this release is the return of drummer Alan Jackman. I have to wonder how good their previous two albums would have been had he remained with the band. John Spinks' songwriting and guitar are spot on, and Tony Lewis' lead vocals and bass lines remain as strong as ever.

{"text": "I noticed one reviewer lamented that the Outfield's newest album is only available as a download.  I just picked up the cd at CD Baby...for a group w/such beautiful vocal harmonies I don't want a muddy mp3 download (I can always make my own from the cd at a higher bit rate).  As for the music, I've always considered \"Voices of Babylon\" to be their high point; \"Replay\" sounds like it could've been recorded at the same time.  For me the main difference is the other groups that I hear in their music.  With \"Babylon\" I heard the Police, 80's Yes, Journey and a little Fixx.  With \"Replay\", the Journey and Fixx references are gone, and the \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\"-era Yes comes to the forefront.  4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't like 3 of the 12 songs, but the other 9 songs are all 5 star material.\n", "val": 0.005972325801849365}
{"text": "The Outfield were a strange band right from the start. Three guys from Britain making American sounding music in the middle of the 1980's music circuit which was predominantly dominated by a second wave of British singers and bands. They sounded so American you thought they were American. Their music was anthemic, stadium friendly pop rock. One listen to \"Your Love\", their sole top 10 hit from 1986, and you were hooked.However, the band's popularity quickly began to dwindle after their debut album, 1985's \"Play Deep\". It wasn't that the hits dried up, but that the general public were fickle and found the band to be a flavor of the month. 1987's \"Bangin'\" was just as good, but it had far fewer hits. 1989's \"Voices Of Babylon\" may have been the band's best work, but the public didn't take to it and it suffered even more than \"Bangin'\". Then drummer Alan Jackman quit the band and John Spinks and Tony Lewis carried on with two more albums, 1990's \"Diamond Days\" and 1992's \"Rockeye\". By 1992, the band had all but faded to oblivion with the grunge movement literally wiping out any last remaining bands from the 1980's (thanks Mr. Cobain). A greatest hits followed in 1996 with two new songs, and then \"Extra Innings\" in 1999 which appeared to be a compilation of old, unreleased songs, and some new songs. Finally, in 2006, \"Any Time Now\" which had no hits on it.And so here we are with \"Replay\", the first album to have Alan Jackman back in the drummer's seat since 1989's \"Voices Of Babylon\". A day late and a dollar short. It seems that \"Replay\" is only going to be in MP3 format as I still don't see a physical release on cd. The music takes repeated listening (something their early work did not require) before its melodies settle in. Still, this is not the band's best work. It's average. I might even go so far as to say that I liked \"Any Time Now\" slightly better than \"Replay\". I don't know who is at fault here. The music is just so-so, the lyrics are just so-so. Are there some good songs here? Yes. \"Aladdin's Cave\", \"California Sun\", \"A Long, Long Time Ago\", \"Shake Your Thing\", \"New York City\" and \"Sandman\" are decent, if not slight.I just listened to all of The Outfield's albums in sequential order before writing this review, and I have to say that their early work was really good--almost effortless. \"Replay\" sounds forced, stale and lackluster. But before you go and get all bent out of shape, consider this: If the newly reunited trio make some more albums, they have the potential for getting their mojo back. The one thing this band has is a unique sound and a sense of melody--even when they are making generic, average music. Of particular note is Tony Lewis' vocals. He still sounds as good today as he did back in 1985, and that's no small feat.So here is how \"Replay\" compares to the band's previous works:1985 Play Deep: Four Stars1987 Bangin': Four Stars1989 Voices Of Babylon: Five Stars1990 Diamond Days: Three and a Half Stars1992 Rockeye: Three and a Half Stars1999 Extra Innings: Three Stars2006 Any Time Now: Three Stars2009 Replay: Three Stars\n", "val": 3.293701956863515e-05}
{"text": "I know the Outfiled from the first album on in 1985. I loved almost all songs from that album and I became a great fan of that group and their music. I bought every album but after 1992, after \"Rockeye\", they seemed to disapear from the business. But in 2010 I was glad to re-discover the Outfiled in the internet and purchased \"Extra Innings\" and \"Any Time Now\" through their website. And I loved these 2 albums as well. I was very surprised and excited to hear that the Outfliled is working on a new album to be released in 2011. Now it's available and I would say that this album is fantastic! The songs are great, more technical, rocking songs, but with much more complexity within the sound. Tony Lewis voice never sounded better than on this recording, much better than on \"Play Deep\". And what wonderful songs: My favourite song is \"A Long, Long Time Ago\" which dropped \"Your Love\" from my internal charts No. 1, although \"Your Love\" is one of the best Outfield songs. But this \"A Long, Long Time Ago\" is - in my opinion - maybe the best Outfiled song ever. This song alone is worth to get this album, which is a must for Outflied fans anyway. To me \"Replay\" is the best album of the Outfiled, an awesome masterpiece of rock history which should be taken into the hall of fame. It's hard to understand, that this album does not hit the charts. What a crazy world world! For me this album gets Five Stars!\n", "val": 0.023597484454512596}
{"text": "I saw The Outfield in Nashville, TN, they are the real deal, they sounded great.  I showed up early and actually got to meet them. John was really nice.  I am enjoying this new collection of songs, I listen to a lot current rock bands, but none of them give me that \"good uplifting happy feeling\" like The Outfield music can.  Another thing I like about The Outfield is there is so much to listen to in their songs.  Seems like in with the bands today there is one thing that draws you in like the lead vocals or the guitar or a hook in the song.  It doesn't take long to get bored/tired of the song.  But The Outfield songs are well written and detailed.  You can't just listen to one thing, you listed to everything, the guitars, vocals & harmonizing vocals, bass and drums and it is weaved together so well and that takes talent.  Good job guys!\n", "val": 0.046728890389204025}

{"text": "I won't get into a long, drawn out review of each song, only provide a couple of observations.  First, congratulations to the boys for getting back together and writing and recording some music again.  If you are a huge '80s Outfield fan, go ahead and buy it.  After a few listens, you will love this collection of songs.  Tony's voice, in its upper register, is strong and clear.  Alan's drums sound great and his drumming patterns are distinctly his.  Much the same for John, his guitar sounds are much like the '80s, with plenty of hard chords and ringing arpegios.  The recording is crystal clear and the production is quite \"bubble-gummy\".  If there are any complaints, I really only have two.  I said the recording is clear, and it is...but there are few moments when the mix is a bit mushy.  Also, I thought these songs lacked some of the strong melodies and \"hooks\" as compared to their '80s hits.  It took a few listens all the way through, but I have come around.  This is their strongest release since Voices of Babylon.  Buy the entire Replay collection of songs, you won't regret it.\n", "val": 0.020025063306093216}

{"text": "I was finally able to afford this. So I said the minute I got the bread for it I was gone drop it on this. Why? Because this is true hip-hop to the core. Why? Cuz Kendrick is spitting straight from the heart and not asking from approval from anyone or anything. I think a lot of artists are losing the ability to create music like this because these record companies are taking too much control to the point they can't be artists like they want to be their just puppets hanging on strings at the mercy of these old ass execs who don't live in the hood and never have and have no connection or relation to the people who consume this music(and that's people of all races). Take Lupe Fiasco for example, if he wouldn't have stood up for himself and told the record company, no, I wonder what would have happened? Maybe one day these artists will wake up and say f these record companies and do it on their own and pay they own taxes. (Seen too many artists being hounded by the gov't and IRS behind something the people they were paying were supposed to do) Cuz seems like being hooked up to a record company doesn't help cuz they give you the advertisement but if you ain't making hits you get treated like a bish. Like Lupe said he went gold last album before his latest release and got multiple awards but they told him that that wasn't good enough. I pray Kendrick never gets tied up in that system. This is one album I have to say you can listen to without skipping a single track. That's rare these days, real rare.\n", "val": 0.00022293179063126445}

For years, bootleggers have been doing their CD game and that's fine - it is easy to pinpoint a bootleg CD instead in comparison to their original counterparts; however, recently, bootleggers are now in the vinyl game, heavy.Which, there is really no problem with. Some albums, such as Yeezus, never received a proper vinyl release and it is disappointing. This is where high quality bootlegs come in and save the day; however, too many bootleggers are claiming \"rare, original, out of print vinyl.\" Just be honest with me and put it at a price where you can still make money.

{"text": "Kendrick is climbing. In \"Section 80\" Kendrick tells a story with the power of a young Nas and in the effortless flow of Tupac. There have been many comparisons to these artists in critical reviews, but it is impossible to ignore. In a way, it feels like he is still trying to find his true voice and has chosen to pay tribute to the flows and styles of Rap's greats on his journey there. From the start, he sets the tone with \"F- your Ethnicity\" - a recurring theme from even the \"Overly Dedicated\" tracks - \"I don't do black music. I don't do white music. I do everyday life music.\" He is an Average Joe telling the stories of our time, from \"ADHD\"'s drug use, to \"Hol Up\"'s exuberance, down to the petty bravado of \"Spiteful Chant\" - they're delivered through a detached and observant lens that hint Kendrick has much more in store. Like Pac, it takes a special talent to address these themes, tell these stories, and keep the audience expectation one level higher with each album. If \"The Recipe\" is any indication, we won't be disappointed.Thanks for making my favorite album of 2011.\n", "val": 0.007691448088735342}

{"text": "At first I REALLY did not like Kendrick Lamar. I listened to ADHD and Rigamortus, and I did not like either song, so I just blew him off when people told me to listen to him. Well, that was probably one of the stupidest things I have ever done. Because I finished and bought the album a few days ago, and it is probably one of my favorites now. ADHD and Rigamortus were probably my least favorite songs from the album, but as a whole the album is great and I was amazed after I listened to the whole thing.The thing that makes this album so great is because it is one of those albums that is what hip hop is all about. Nowadays you see rappers rapping about stuff like cars, women, drugs, and that's literally ALL they talk about. Rap music has become so stale recently, but it's albums like this that are keeping it alive. I love this album because it sends positive messages to people as opposed to talking about the stupid stuff I mentioned earlier. Kendrick is one of those unique artists that is able to talk to the people and send a message about society in his raps.In this album most of the songs are fantastic lyrically and Kendrick always has a great flow. There are a few songs that I didn't like such as The Spiteful Chant and Rigamortus, but outside of a few the album is great as a whole. There are songs like F*** Your Ethnicity where he talks about racism, Keisha's song where he talks about awful career choices made by a woman, Hiiipower where he encourages the public to join a movement, ADHD where he talks about problems with drug abuse in today's society, etc. Almost every song on this album sends a message to people about society and that's what I feel is most important in rap: sending a message and telling a story.This album is really cheap on Amazon and well worth it for what you're getting. If you like rap, chances are you will like this album but definitely give it a listen before buying it because I could understand why people who are rap fans wouldn't like him. But the bottom line is, if you have the 5 bucks, definitely get this because it's a fantastic album that will not disappoint.Memorable songs from album: Hiiipower, Keisha's Song, No Make Up, ADHD\n", "val": 0.020011432468891144}

{"text": "I've heard all of the high praise this album recieved prior to me downloading it and I have to say...it meets and sometimes even surpasses what I expected. Kendrick Lamar is quickly becoming one of my favorite new artists in hip hop and this album showcases exactly why. \"Section .80\" is a collection of lyrically driven and thought provoking songs that showcases Lamar's talent behind the pen and his charisma in front of the mic. The guest spots aren't as frequent as your average rapper's project but I think that is part of this album's charm. Kendrick Lamar is more than fully capable of holding you attention on his own so he doesn't rely on the big name features. I would give this 5 stars but some of the interludes between the album are hit n' miss. They are meant to keep the albums' theme but pull the listener away from the music. Still this is a great joint! And @ 5.99 its something of a steal. If you're a fan like myself than DOWNLOAD IT. If you're not a fan but interested in hearing what all the fuss is about then DOWNLOAD IT. Highlights include: \"Hiii Power\", \"Ronald Regan Era\", \"ADHD\", \"Hol' Up\".\n", "val": 0.027794597670435905}
{"text": "Kendrick Lamar is one of the very few new rappers out there that knows how to tell compelling stories. He is only 24, but this is a real man that has something to say about the world and not just the same juvenile struggles that mainstream rappers from the Young Money camp or Maybach Music try to do.  Kendrick Lamar tells stories of struggles from his view, from women's point of view and real issues that not a lot of rappers out there would even attempt to address nowadays. Yes, issues such as abortion, bad relationships, violence, drugs have been touched before, however Kendrick Lamar does it in such a clever fasion that it is undeniable that this young MC understands the world in a much broader sense than your college scholar's . At first listen, I will admit Kendrick Lamar is not the easiest person to listen to at times, his voice and personality takes some warming up to if you haven't listened to his music before, but once you do, it is just smooth sailing from there on because this young man is the best thing to come out of Compton since The Game's \"The Documentary\" album.This album is a concept album that revolves around two main characters Tammy and Keisha, and the whole album is a narrative about the lives of these two very different people whom ultimately end up in destruction with no viable solution. Section. 80 tells multiple stories from both male and female perspectives of the crack generation during the 80s and how those kids in America in poverty were living. The production on the album is incredible to say the least, every track is DIFFERENT which is what I love about the album. You have some jazzy tracks like \"Hol Up\" & \"Ab-Souls Outro\" which is not what I expect from a westcoast rapper, but then he shows signs of aggresion with tracks featuring rough and rugged beats such as \"Ronald Reagan Era\" \"The Spiteful Chant\" & \"HiiiPower\" which just goes to show how lyrically raw Kendrick Lamar is as a true MC. The album has laidback party tracks as well such as \"Blow My High\" and \"A.D.H.D.\" which helps diversify the album a bit more. But the real heartfelt tracks with storys such as \"Keishas Song (Her Pain)\" and \"No Make-Up (Her Vice)\" is where Kendrick capitializes his amazing artistry. Kendrick raps with such wit and speed (\"Rigamortis\") that he only propels as the album goes on. His flow is awesome, he can easily switch up at almost any time with no sign of deficiant slack. Once again, Lamar really knows how to paint vivid pictures filled with social commentary with real positive messages despite the overuse of the N word as well as b****; but there is a lot of substance on this album and he is really thought provoking that the cursing is simply just in context. Just when I can't praise this album enough, I will just say that this is the direction Hip Hop music should be taking, and from a GROWN Young MC still learning about the world, it is really exicting to see what Kendrick Lamar has in stores for listeners in the future. Kendrick Lamar is wise beyond his years, and considering the other crappy hip hop arists around his age, he is just a breath of fresh air.Top Tracks:1) HiiiPower - produced by J. Cole :) Great lyricism and great delivery from Kendrick2) Keishas Song (Her Pain) - weird sounding hook, but truly a beautifully sad story of a broken girl3) Ab-Souls Outro - As Kendrick would say, dope instrumentation with a mix of spoken word poetry4) Rigamortus - Incredible flow5) The Spiteful Chant - direct and in your face, humorous, love the beat and love the hook6) Hol' Up - love the jazz inspired production7) F*** Your Ehtnicity - Tackles racism and as well as Kendrick Lamar introducing to what kind of person he is8) A.D.H.D. - an atmospheric track showcasing Kendrick's agility, not to mention a great party trackI Love the entire album, and if you know good hip hop then you should already own this. #HiiiPoWer\n", "val": 0.01674029976129532}

You are my new favorite rapper dude, for real...Ok, so I just bought this on amazon mp3 status, about $4!  I feel kinda bad, it's soooo good I would've bought it for more!  So I'm just listening to all the songs as I right this... (Chapter 6, AWESOME cause you just gotta listen to it.)My fav song right now is Poe mans dream, chapter 6, Hol'up, ADHD, and counting!You like hip hop?  You like music?  You like stuff that ain't on the radio and it's so great that you're happy you're the only one who has it first out of your group of peeps?  THEN THIS IS THE TICKET.I first heard Kendrick on Jay Rock's Follow me home album from STRRAAAAANGE music... Shot out to tech n9ne for sho do...Kendrick is tight, and he's gonna get better.  He's young, ambitious, and hungry.  That stirs up for great music.  And he delivered for sure...Then kendrick showed up on Game's RED album, which is also sicker than sick, and Kendrick killed it on the city...  And I had the pleasure of watching him perform live onstage with GAME at the KDAY fresh fest this past saturday!  Dude killed it!  My Goodness, I can't contain myself~ HAHAHAHAHA!So now I stumbled upon this album while looking at evidence's cats and dogs, and damn, I am soooo happy I found this!  I LOVE IT in a non 'you know what' kinda way.  Inspiring, motivating, and relaxing all in one and then some... not alot of people can do that... I'll play this out for sure...Thanks for reading, please get it and support the most awesomest new artist from WEST COAST!$PMONEY$\n", "val": 0.005249745678156614}

{"text": "I had heard of Kendrick in some feeds that I keep up with, but I never really checked him out. When I heard him on \"The City\" on \"The R.E.D. Album\", I was sold. I bought it almost immediately. I can't lie, at first I was a little disappointed; I was expecting (or at least hoped) that every track would have the emotion that he put into the recording of \"The City\". I still liked it, but some songs just lacked that raw emotion I wanted to hear. With that being said, come the second listen, I got over it. There's some tracks that do what I was looking for, but I really enjoy the others. They have a \"cool/laid-back\" feel to them, which makes the album good for ambient music and of course there are more lyric-heavy tracks too and they don't disappoint. BUY THIS ALBUM! You won't be disappointed; besides, it's only $4.\n", "val": 0.0028612345922738314}

{"text": "I'm a new listener of Trevor Hall but I got hooked on my first listening.  There is a rich quality to his voice... if likened to a wine, he would be barrel fermented, buttery and best served warm. If likened to another artist I'd lean towards Dave Matthews.  The album title suits well because this is everything everytime everywhere!  Traces of soulful, refreshing and captivating essences all wrapped up in a smooth delivery that delights the ears and the heart. Quality music speaks a feeling that there truly aren't fitting enough words to describe.  Trevor Hall IS quality music.  Clearly reggae influences but I also hear blues and rock and of course this blend carries deep indie vibe.  This album overnight made it to my daily playlist.(sidenote: if you are say forty-something listening to the same old stuff that you've been listing to for the past five to twenty years... clear out some room and put this guy on your list!  he will fit in with many classics and freshen things up for you... as is my experience.)\n", "val": 0.0199622493237257}

Now, with the release of this album, I'm completely sold. \"Everything Everytime Everywhere\" shows us a slightly different Trevor. It would seem that Trevor has reached new internal heights, and his lyrics in these songs reflect this. His voice, as always, is sexy and quite easy on the ears. Long time fans won't be disappointed, as this album is musically eclectic - with folk and reggae influences, Sanskrit chant, a couple short spoken word poetry pieces, etc. Trevor's words have always inspired me, and this collection of songs is no exception. Thanks Trevor! :)\n", "val": 0.03631603345274925}

{"text": "I first came across this artist at a John Butler concert in Colorado. This was the opening band. Long story short, I actually left the show liking this group far more than John Butler. I would never of expected that to happen in a million years but if you take the time to check this group out then you'll likely soon understand. The group clashes very different styles of music together, including Hindu, Reggae, Pop, and Folk, so effortlessly to create a totally unique sound. The music also has a spiritual element to it that I find quite appealing. See them live and you won't regret it.Trevor Hall himself seems to be an \"all about the music\" kind of artist and makes it clear during his shows that the \"music business\" will never change his style or tell him how to play his songs. He has a very upbeat and loving personality that clearly shows through his music. He also works hard to raise money for a group in India that has been known to feed children, builds schools, and builds orphanages.All in all I'd keep an eye on this group because they could be hitting the mainstream at any moment.\n", "val": 0.020842289552092552}

{"text": "People's preference in music is so subjective that it's hard to say a musician is a must have. Plus music is so hard to describe in words, often coming out too technical that the average person doesn't understand or too generic that it's described the same as everyone else' music. I think the best compliment you can give to a musician is to highly recommend to others that you give the album a listen to judge for themselves if it meets their tastes. I can say that this album is definitely one of those albums that i would advise giving a listen. Trevor Hall has a sound that is definitely unique, he's very polished, and his lyricism is excellent. If you like reggae, jazz, folk, rock, ska at all or you like artists such as Franti and Spearhead, Slightly Stoopid, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sublime, G Love or Jason Mraz then I would definitely recommend giving him a listen because there is a good chance that you'll keep his album on play for months straight.\n", "val": 0.017750196158885956}

{"text": "Being a new age music journalist for over 30 years as well as a music producer myself who has worked on a number of guided meditation recordings, I can say that, in my experience, Meditations2Go are some of the best I've heard. The series is the work of Rob Brookler, who has been a meditation teacher in the Los Angeles area for 28 years Having worked with many groups and individuals in that time, he draws from real life experience and has created a practical approach to not only focusing the mind, but on gaining insight into many of the issues that are prevalent in our day to day lives. In addition to the audio meditations, his website also offers a wealth of well-written articles that offer guidance for a variety of personal challenges and life learning. While these are presented as a supplement to the meditations and embody many of the principles found within, they can be quite helpful in their own right, and the fact that they are available to read free of charge speaks to the positive intention and goodwill of Rob and his siteOne of the things that impressed me the most about Meditations2Go is how well produced and professional they are. A standout feature for me is Rob's voice. His tone and timbre, as well as his pacing and cadence are about as perfect as you could want for something of this nature. He also has a wonderful ear for the kind of music that is best suited for each topic, and will even spend time in the studio with the soundtrack producer during the recording process to help tailor it for the particular meditation. Needless to say, I am very impressed with Meditations2Go and am greatly enjoying and benefiting from integrating their soothing ambience and insightful narratives into my life.\n", "val": 0.04382087290287018}

{"text": "\"Meditations2Go\" are \"guided audio meditations featuring synchronized music and narration,\" each about 30 minutes in length. Each one is original and unique, with it's own sequencing and background music based upon a blend of traditional and contemporary meditation techniques. Being a new age music journalist for over 30 years as well as a music producer myself who has worked on a number of guided meditation recordings, I can say that, in my experience, \"Meditations2Go\" are some of the best I've heard. The series is the work of Rob Brookler, who has been a meditation teacher in the Los Angeles area for 28 years Having worked with many groups and individuals in that time, he draws from real life experience and has created a practical approach to not only focusing the mind, but on gaining insight into many of the issues that are prevalent in our day to day lives.One of the things that impressed me the most about \"Meditations2Go\" is how well produced and professional they are. A standout feature for me is Rob's voice. His tone and timbre, as well as his pacing and cadence are about as perfect as you could want for something of this nature. He also has a wonderful ear for the kind of music that is best suited for each topic, and will even spend time in the studio with the soundtrack producer during the recording process to help tailor it for the particular meditation. Needless to say, I am very impressed with \"Meditations2Go\" and am greatly enjoying and benefiting from integrating their soothing ambiance and insightful narratives into my life.\n", "val": 0.04815024137496948}

{"text": "Let's cut right to the chase here. I gave this 4 stars because it is screaming trees. But honestly I couldn't be unbiased here. I hated and live to forget Sour Oblivion and Dust, two sellout records where the Trees intended on changing aka homogenizing their sound for the masses. They created crap for the fairweather pop lemmings and it sold from 92-96. BUt not as well as most other commercial bands. They sounded commercial, corporate, glossy, overproduced, mainstream, and everything most of the band was categorically against!But the pursuit of fame and fortune never truly landed them any happiness and they closed up shop circa 2000 going out in a live show without even a whimper. Noone veen knew they existed for most of their existence. And noone even cared they hung it up besides myself and a handful of true fans. Quality wise this is no better than a 3 because it reminds me, and should, of Sour Oblivion and Dust. It sounds most like those 2 commercial offerings. BUt I have the original 9 song demo that is much more rough and low-fi than this version. The one I have came from 1998, but sounded as if it was recorded in their earlier days.This cd has alot of good music. But it's way too cleaned up, polished, etc for my tastes. Just as their 92-96 material was. I will give it a pass because my version of it  shows they could still put out raw indie work from the heart. Even if the finished product turned into this thing. It looks major label, it sounds major label, the whole thing looks like they were trying to cash in on something. And I don't fault them for it. They earned it after all those years. And this is much better than either Oblivion or Dust could be in any world. Still it cannot even come close to anything they did on Velvetone, SST, Sub Pop or K. Not even close.But that was then, this is now. Actually this is the end... I will not remember them for \"Last Words\". I will love them for Other Worlds/Clair-Voy-Ance/Even If/Invisible Lantern/Change Has Come/Buzz Factory and maybe even for Uncle Anesthesis but not so much...So as I said, this is a 3 at best but I give it 4 because it's the Trees and I know they are better than this...>\n", "val": 5.40997862117365e-05}

Well, I for one am completely thrilled to be jamming to 'new' Trees music after all this time.  The sound here is more of a Sweet Oblivion vibe than of a Dust vibe; driving, rough, bluesy, and well structured but without all of the overdubs and orchestral flourishes present on Dust.  Overall, this recording not only does justice to the memory of one of the best (and most underrated) bands of the 1990's, but it fits right at home among the best of their already impressive discography.  Highly recommended to all Screaming Trees fans as well as to those who want to expand their musical horizons.

{"text": "This 3CD-box set is a budget price assembly of older recordings signed by the great keyboard virtuoso Murray Perahia in the company of his wonderful London players from Academy of St Martin in the Fields. I had the rare chance to listen to Murray Perahia performing - as soloist and conductor - along with these wonderful musicians two years ago, in September 2009, during the XIXth edition of the \"George Enescu\" International Festival in Bucharest. I must confess that there is a magic fluid moving on stage when they play together, a special communion of thoughts and feelings translated masterfully into sound and finally into artistic joy. Perahia, as usual, is an accomplished pianist, but when he conducts from the keyboard he becomes a demiurge. He recreates worlds of uplifting and joyful consistency. Carefully with the smallest detail of the score, interested in the finest nuance of each instrument and devoted to the pure musical beauty, Perahia is very selective with regard to the repertory to be performed. He seems not attracted by arid musical abstractions, loving only the meaningful and heart-felted music. That's why he devoted a long time in his career to a fruitful foray into the realm simply named Johann Sebastian Bach. Of course, there are a lot of great composers such as Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Scarlatti, Schubert, Mendelssohn or Schumann in his repertory, but chiefly Bach. He returns time and again to this rich source of musical truths. Partitas, English Suites, Goldberg Variations, Italian Concerto - all stand in Perahia's recital programs (live or recorded), on equal footing with keyboard concertos, his subtle pianism ensuring both the reliable foundation of the proceedings and the robust bridge towards the orchestral textures.This is the case here. Some sparkling recordings where Murray Perahia offers his inspired vision of no less than 10 masterpieces from Bach catalogue, namely the keyboard concertos in D minor BWX 1052, in E major BWX 1053, in D major BWV 1054, in A major BWX 1055, in F minor BWX 1056, in F major BWX 1057 and in G minor BWX 1058, also known as keyboard concertos nos. 1 to 7, along with the A minor Concerto for flute, violin and clavier (BWV 1044) and the Brandenburg Concerto no. 5 in D major (BWV 1050). Much gusto, vivacity, playfulness - in Allegros, lyrical meditation in Andante or Largo, compelling wit throughout! The response of his accomplished chamber players contributes to the unique perfume of an otherworldly interpretation. The high class of the performers shimmers with a noble delicacy also in their meekness in from of the Giant of the Baroque Music. Although the score is read with no complexes or humble hesitations, the dialogue with Bach permanently reassesses the proper positions.Perahia solos along with two distinguished colleagues from his London ensemble - the violinist Kenneth Sillito (the concert-maestro / leader of the Academy) and the flutist Jaime Martin. Their collaboration yields a valuable rendition of these works, featuring Bach as the robust ancestor of the modern keyboard concerto. Jakob Lindberg's contribution at the theorbo rounds off the needed Baroque atmosphere. However, in my opinion, the climax of these recordings is reached in the famous Italian Concerto in F major (BWV 971) for solo keyboard. It reveals once more the renowned craftsmanship of Perahia, his unmatched poetic touch. A thoughtful and colour-oriented pianism is masterly displayed, with meditative inflections and vivid finger-work to shed a fresh (but nut disturbing) light on these evergreens. Perahia's approach aims at revealing a truly meditative realm (see, for instance, the soaring central movement - Andante) and subtly contrasting it with a witty playfulness (in the outer movements) based on a impressive musical knowledge. The excellent recorded sound is favoured (besides Perahia's stunning mastery) by use of a concert grand capable of an amazing palette of nuances.All in all, an outstanding CD box set, featuring a valuable and aristocratic rendition in Bach's recordings catalogue signed by inspired Murray Perahia!\n", "val": 0.013839233666658401}
{"text": "This 3-CD set is a repackaging of the 3 separate CDs that Murray Perahia recorded in the early 2000's for Sony Classical, featuring the 7 keyboard concertos, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, the Concerto for Flute, Violin and keyboard (BWV 1044), and one solo keyboard work, the Italian Concerto in F (BWV 971).  The first thing that should be said is that if you are wedded to the idea of J.S. Bach's music as best performed on period instruments, with minimal vibrato and tuned at lower pitch, and with a harpsichord instead of a piano as the keyboard instrument, this set is not for you.  (FWIW, I tend to favor Bach on period instruments.)  In that sense, these recordings are a kind of a \"throwback\" to a time of Bach performance before the HIP/period instrument movement took over the baroque and classical eras.  Murray Perahia obviously uses a piano throughout, the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields is obviously a modern instrument ensemble, and vibrato is not banished from the ensemble.However, with that said, if you're a fan of Murray Perahia or are otherwise generally open to the idea of J.S. Bach done in this \"throwback\" style, this set is very enjoyable on its own terms.  His performances are generally quite straightforward, no fuss or muss, no pulling of tempo about.  While vibrato isn't banished, it's not particularly laid on with a trowel either.  Even though all the instruments are \"modern\", and the instrumental textures do feel \"weightier\" than a period instrument band would sound, the performances generally don't have that sense of stereotypical \"heaviness\" that one might associate with modern instruments and Bach performances of the era of Mengelberg and Stokowski.  The one relatively turgid or \"heavy\" moment, for me, was the opening of BWV 1044, but that is the exception rather than the rule.  As well, Perahia gives a fine rendition of BWV 971, where he's obviously on his own, straightforward and clean.One small documentary change from the earlier issue is that the theorbo player, Jakob Lindberg, was credited on BWV 1044 and BWV 1050, but his name is omitted from the credit in this reissue.  Likewise, the earlier liner notes from the individual issue are replaced with a single survey essay from Jeremy Siepmann.\n", "val": 0.0005472711054608226}

{"text": "In 2007 the world was introduced to a new artist with a fresh take on modern R&B; her name was Emily King. J Records had just released her Debut album entitled Eastside Story. The album produced pop singles \"U & I\" and \"Walk in My Shoes\" featuring Lupe Fiasco. Despite heavy rotation from her hometown of New York City, and touring with popular R&B acts like John Legend, Lyfe Jennings, and (the now disbanded) Floetry , the album peaked at #60 on the Billboard charts. This setback led to a new direction in King's career as she parted ways with her record label and tweaked her musical style to create a signature sound more relevant to her jazz inspired upbringing.King now reintroduces herself in her sophomore album, Seven. Each of the seven tracks (hints the album title) allows her to reconnect to the spirituality of music. The calmness, the soft tempos, and the haunting hums over the subtle beats make for an album well suited for quiet evening at home or simply to relax after stressful day.  Seven starts with the beautiful harmony of \"Down\" describing the adverse effects of a good relationship that has become a source of negative energy.  Her raspy soprano flows over each note pulling the audience closer into the emotion of the song. \"Radio\" is more of an ode to music. This song has a Nora Jones type of feel and though most of the words were almost inaudible, it doesn't cause the tune to simmer. \"Georgia\" is one of the most unique songs on the album. Though the beat is simple, and the lyrics are thin, the smooth pleas for a lost love are not lost in the delivery of the message. Also, the 1950's violin-trimmed ending added the perfect romantic touch proving that everyone can love intensely if given the chance.  This EP is only for true music lovers with a passion for acoustics, harmony and blues. There are no heavy baselines, auto-tuned dance hits or watered down lyrics as an accessory to a mainstream rhythm. All you will find is an artist who has studied her craft and executes a soulful masterpiece. If this album is any indication of the type of artist Emily King will be, she is destined to take the R&B music scene by storm\n", "val": 0.006967466324567795}

I have even used it while going across country on the Amtrak to help me sleep on the train.  This is really a must have.The only negative comment I can make really isn't the fault of the album, is that some of the songs are short and cut off but it is a sampler after all.

{"text": "I downloaded this sampler album from Amazon out of curiosity, and because I liked the picture of the cat on the cover. What I expected is to hear native American flute music without any accompanying instruments or sound effects. I like to hear any ethnic music in more or less its original form. Since this is a sampler, the album consists of different artists. Some pieces on the album are great and minimalistic, others not so much, which motivated me to give this only 4 out of 5 stars. A number of pieces contain the Spanish guitar. I like Spanish guitar, but not when it is mixed with native American music. Come on! How genuine is that?Another gripe I have is almost every flute piece is modified to sound as if it playing at a concert hall, or in a big tunnel, you will always hear the amplified reflection effect of the instrument. I know that it was added using computer software and sometimes it is very appropriate, but with the wonderful music on this album I believe is severely overdone. Considering that there are forest sound effects added to the music, it is even less likely that you'd hear the distance amplification effect. If it were played inside a forest with leaves around, it would sound normal like if you're playing it inside a garage.Despite what I have written above, don't miss out on this album. This is overall very nice. I think some people may find it good to calm down the nerves or meditate and just hard to find in general.\n", "val": 0.00012763422273565084}

{"text": "I also have to second the review below.  It is exceptional music to do the deed with, but what I've found most surprising is the general everyday uses for this blisful sound.  Everyone knows that zombies are a menace.  They are always knocking things over, leaving limbs lying around house or yard, and trying to eat your brains.  Annoying...you know it, I know it, the dog carrying your neighbors femur knows it.  You can't go a single day without getting into some kind of zombie related disturbance.  However, this fantastic collection of flute music actually seems to soother these rather brainless creatures.  We've actually been able to domesticate many of them turning them into cheap slave labor.  Why does this product not advertise such a feature?  Well I guess its because of the moral implications of zombie slavory.  We know there are many zombie rights activists out there and I don't believe in debating that here, but whether for or against it's good to now have the knowledge.

Native American flute songs allow me to maintain my erection longer than I ever could in the past, I had to experiment at the beginning before I found the right dose for me, but once I did I found the results to be thrilling.Before I started listening I had lost all interest in sex. I know the manufacturers say that they don't have an effect on libido, but even if it's all in my head I find that listening to these Native American flute songs puts me in the mood like nothing else can.  Maybe it's because I've had such good results with them that I instantly associate them with good performance and satisfying sex.

{"text": "OK, you have folks like Raffi and Ella Jenkins and Justin Roberts -- people who, once they started recording music for kids, showed little interest to breaking away from that and recording for adults. But there's a long history of \"adult\" artists dipping their toes into the world of kids' music -- Carole King, Johnny Cash, Harry Nilsson, Tony Bennett, all the way up through They Might Be Giants, Lisa Loeb, and Barenaked Ladies and every artist who's ever recorded a song for kids' music compilation. Some, like TMBG (or Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie long before them), spend a lot of time there, but usually the artists return to the world of checking for fake IDs and adult themes.Which is what makes watching Chris Ballew, longtime Presidents of the United States of America member, so interesting to me. In less than four years, he's released four albums for families as Caspar Babypants, including this week's new release, Sing Along!. Over the course of that time period, Ballew has thrown himself into the project with energy and has tapped a rich vein of creativity. While all four of his albums are very good, this new one is my favorite and one of the best albums of the year.It starts off with \"Bad Blue Jay,\" with its \"Yes, sirs\" and \"No, sirs\" clearly inspired by the \"Yes, ma'ams\" and \"No ma'ams\" of the kids' classic \"Mr. Rabbit.\" Next is \"Wild Wild Time,\" which uses an old Beethoven melodic line. And on it goes, with Ballew pulling in influences from all over and creating new folk songs or in time-honored folk tradition, tweaking classics like \"Ba Ba Black Sheep\" or giving a hint of Beach Boys sound on \"Long Long Dream.\" Also, I really dig Mike \"Outtasite\" Singleton's rap turn on the classic \"Dem Bones.\" And while Ballew's always been willing to do very simple music for the very young, doing things like getting Frances England to duet with you on \"Loud and Quiet\" (or Rachel Loshak on the album-closer \"Baby Cloud\") makes those teachable songs listenable long after the concepts have been mastered.The album's targeted at kids ages 1 through 5, though hopefully I've made clear that older kids will dig it, too.I really, really like Sing Along! -- the Caspar Babypants disks have been favorites at our house for a long time, and I see no reason why this new album won't join its predecessors in heavy rotation. If he can keep it up, Chris Ballew might just create a body of work for preschoolers to rival Raffi's. Highly recommended.[Review originally posted at&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Zooglobble/dp/B002KT1YPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Zooglobble</a>.]\n", "val": 0.02037997916340828}

The lyrics are clever, the music is catchy and I enjoy it as much as our girl does.  She is 12 months now and starts dancing in her carseat as soon as \"Bad Blue Jay\" comes on!  We're making sure to get a backup copy of this CD as well as adding all of his other CDs to our music library.\n", "val": 0.024321410804986954}

{"text": "The music on this CD is deserving of 5 stars based on the samples here on Amazon, but the packaging leaves something to be desired.  I purchased two copies of this CD as gifts and was surprised and disappointed when the CDs arrived in thin paper sleeves, not jewel cases.  For the price, I would have expected a better presentation.  I think the music is great, and it won't annoy parents like so many other children's CDs, but to give as a gift to someone with curious little fingers, it needs something more sturdy than a paper sleeve.  Still, I plan to purchase other titles by Caspar Babypants.  What a fun way to tie in music from my youth (Presidents of the U.S.A.) for my toddler and his friends!\n", "val": 0.00010012461279984564}

I do recall the first time hearing this song with Melanie in it, I was floored. I couldn't get it out of my head but was saddened to find out the album version has someone featured on it that doesn't even provide vocals. So basically it's Cee-Lo singing by himself.

{"text": "I remember reading, somewhere, how Joni Mitchell's favourite version of her classic 'Both Sides Now' was a performance by an elderly chanteuse; it is a song that strangely blends innocence and experience, and while it was written by a 23 year old, Mitchell felt that the disillusionment and growth explored in the lyrics could only be perfectly conveyed by an artist with a lifetime behind her.  Mitchell was inspired to compose the song by reading Saul Bellow's _Henderson the Rain King_, a Bildungsroman with an ironically middle-aged protagonist in a belated quest for meaning in his life.  It is surely not an accident that Dave Nachmanoff chose to cover another anthem inspired by (and titled after) 'The Rain King' as the fourth track on his new album, _Step Up_, because the album is itself an introspective odyssey that tracks the thread of identity backwards and forwards through the labyrinth of time.  But while the subject matter may be deep and complex, Nachmanoff displays a musical and narrative finesse that glosses over the philosophy with pure enjoyment and never lets the powerful emotions become jarring or incongruent._Step Up_ is an album whose lyrics are to be read through newly-acquired reading glasses and eyes bleared by decades of real life.  The characters and narrative personae are disillusioned, if not world-weary, and look back on their former selves with yearning, regret, disappointment, pity and sometimes cynical self-criticism, but the progression is finally towards enlightenment and, in the end, each listener is left to determine for himself whether the apotheosis of the final lines of the last track is an awakening or merely a drunken flight from darkness.  The disc starts with the tentative optimism of 'Fragile Thing,' where a battered heroine nurtures hope in a new romance, but the free indirect discourse of the ostensibly third person lyrics interposes an aura of doubt between her and the desired happy ending.  In 'Sheila Won't be Comin' Home,' the title character is turning her back on a life that, 'like a lover' has 'never quite arrived,' and the plaintive 'In Sickness and in Health' confronts the intimations of mortality that come with middle age, in the context of a successful relationship, reminding us that even fulfilled romance must ultimately succumb to fate.  Even when Nachmanoff confronts doubts about the very fate of planet Earth with uncharacteristic scepticism in 'Eternal Star,' the message is in the cognitive dissonance between the depressing vision and the transcendental brightness of the music.In 'When You Were Mine,' the speaker literally takes a walk down memory lane, recalling a former love affair from the perspective of an early morning stroll through environs he and his paramour knew previously from late, celebratory nights.  In this song, Nachmanoff cleverly keeps the descriptive verses in present tense to convey the identity of the past and present environment, while reflecting, in the more temporally aware chorus, on the internal shift that the end of the relationship has brought about to render the change in the speaker's worldview.  The equally upbeat 'Conservation Law' is a tongue-in-cheek parody of the 'love at first sight' tradition that humorously revisits the _Phaedrus_ of Plato which had much earlier inspired Nachmanoff's 'All Too Human.'  Its reductio ad absurdam gently lampoons the Sokratic notion that what we fall in love with is those aspects of a person that remind us of the gods we followed in a former existence.One of the most intriguing mechanisms _Step Up_ uses in its dialectic of the self is the inclusion of four songs by a much younger Nachmanoff, each addressing a shaded side of personal change and discovery.  Of these, the new version of 'Descartes in Amsterdam' stands astride the apex of the album like a colossus.  Ronan Chris Murphy's spare, eerie production makes a wild, desolation for Dave's haunted vocal to wander in like a landscape by Dali or El Greco, stalked by the primitive-sounding percussion.  While the Cartesian 'ego' strives to decontextualise itself in 'Amsterdam,' 'Not What I Expected' delves further still into primordial consciousness invoking the idea of the self and The Other as one, momentarily differentiated in a metaphysical game of one-player hide-and-seek.  Tropes and figures careen into one another with seeming abandon until all existence is finally typified in the eternal anticipation of the line 'listening in the silence, counting seconds 'til the thunder.'  `Changing' is ostensibly about the widening chasm in a relationship, but at a deeper level describes the self-alienation that results from inevitable metamorphoses in our Heraklitean universe.  `City of Angels' tracks a young artist's journey from wide-eyed hope to disappointment to exaltation of the spirit (though it is left unclear whether the spirit is inspirational or intoxicating).The inclusion of these four early works commenting on disillusionment and mutability on a fresh album by a more mature artist gives an intriguing multi-dimensional perspective to _Step Up_.  Changes to the lyrics are negligible from the original releases, and instead, the juxtaposition with newer material and the performances themselves are left to inform our understanding.  We are invited, I believe, to view our current selves as we would have done in younger years, had we been able to, and also to reflect on our past nature and decisions from a mature viewpoint.  Beyond that, however, we must recognise that we are still in flux and prepare to become what we cannot now even suspect.Dave looked for a two word title for this album, and finally chose _Step Up_.  The appellation is apt, the phrase being ambiguous and interpretable either as the carnival barker's cry encouraging us to approach and face strange, shocking and wonderful manifestations, or as the teacher's exhortation to raise ourselves to a new level and new challenges.  In the end, an equally appropriate two word inscription might have been `gnothi seauton,' `Know Thyself.'\n", "val": 0.00560543779283762}
{"text": "Step Up is Dave's most polished and interesting collection yet.  Fixed solidly within the folk-rock tradition, he combines touches of influence from pop, R&B, jazz, country, and maybe even a little bit of swing to create a rich and versatile style uniquely his own.  The songs carry the listener gently across the vast landscape of human experience: life; love; mystery; gain and loss; growth, change and decline; first hellos and final exits.  And, he has recruited a masterful set of back-up musicians and vocalists and skilled producer to pull it all together.  It was a special treat to hear Al Stewart's guest appearance on \"Sheila,\" which he co-wrote with Dave.\n", "val": 0.05007835477590561}

{"text": "I first listened to Terri Clark several years ago, when she first hit the country music big in the US. Great voice & catchy tunes.  I just learned that she if from north of the border in Canada.  Interesting, she has more of an accent from Alabama or West Texas than a Canadian.This CD is great.  That same beautiful voice and great catchy tunes.  The photos show that she is as beautiful as ever.  I get the impression that some of the changes in her life have had an impact on her music and life's changes can throw some curves at us.  The impact on this CD, thought, seem to have sharpened her focus and softened her tone.  These changes, for me, are good. If you remember the Terri Clark from years ago, you will like this CD.  If you are not an old fan of Terri's and like great solid country music, you will also like this CD. Just don't know why I haven't heard any of these tunes on the radio or satellite radio.  Hey Radio guys & gals:  do your listeners a favor and give this one some play time.  \"They\" will appreciate the favor.

{"text": "Prime Cuts: Northern Girl, Smile, The OnePain and suffering have the ability to make poets out of us.  Over the last few years, Clark has had her share of tragedies: from the death of her mother to cancer in 2010, the drying up of her hits, the ensuing loss of her recording contract and her second divorce.  Yet the pinch of life has not sanitised her in anyway.  Rather, her trails had made her a keener observer of life and this is well reflected on her new album, of which she co-wrote 9 out of the 10 cuts.  Relative to her other 7 albums, \"Roots and Wings\" is more balanced and mature collection.  While Clark tries to emulate the tough and witty chic persona in her earlier hits such as \"Better Things to Do, \"Girls Lie Too\" and \"You're Easy on the Eye,\" this time round she does mix in songs that deal with issues that has to do with the heart.  Stylistically, this album is far more adventurous and more encompassing.  While Clark used to major on the rousing barn burners, this time around she has expanded her palette to include an old fashioned country tune (\"Lonesome Last's Call\"), a rock tune (\"We're Here for a Good Time\") and a Kate Wolf type of folk (\"Flowers in the Snow\").It is not serendipitous that this album is titled \"Roots and Wings.\"  Clark has indeed returned to her Canadian roots with the lead single \"Northern Girl.\"  While country music has copious songs extolling the Southern states of America, it is a jolt to hear of Clark singing jubilantly about driving on black ice, tunneling through snow and trying to survive the frigid Canadian winters.  Another paean of Canadian origin is Clark's take of Troop's 1977 hit \"We Are Here for a Good Time.\"  As the title suggests this is a feel good number that would make for a great soundtrack for a joy ride.  Not only has Clark chosen to sing about the land north of the 49th Parallel, she has also collaborated with fellow Canadians such as Victoria Banks and Deric Ruttan.  Banks co-wrote with Clark and Tia Sillers the average sounding rocking radio-tailored \"Wrecking Ball\" which tells of the story of a missions-centered woman.  While Ruttan co-wrote with Clark and Sillers the much better \"The Good Was Great.\" \"The Good Was Great\" is a matured look at a relationship whereby it teaches us to look to the positive sides rather than tooth picked through the bad.As with the other side of the album's title, Clark has also spread her wings to soar into uncharted territories.  \"Lonesome's Last Call,\" a track Clark wrote with Jim Rushing when she was only 22 years old is something you never expect from Clark.  A track that sits more comfortably on Patty Loveless' Mountain Soul albums, this is a track that intones with a foreboding ache about people who tether on romance's ending line.  \"Smile,\" which features some haunting vocals from Alison Krauss, is Clark at her vulnerable best.  Wrapping her mellifluous contralto around this tender tribute to her late mother, this ballad is enough to push us over to tearsville.  Again, Clark pushes the envelope with the plaintive \"Flowers in the Snow,\" a poetic adieu to a love that has died, which has a folky Kate Wolf vibe.Perhaps most autobiographical is \"The One\" where Clark advises all single gals to find a \"love you can't live without\" rather than just settling.  What is noteworthy about \"The One\" is that it finds Clark teaming up with songwriter Tom Shapiro again.  Shapiro is not only a top tiered country writer but he was crafting many of Clark's earlier hits.  \"Roots and Wings\" is a balanced effort finding Clark finally at home singing about her roots.  Yet, it is not too comfortable for Clark as she soars to new heights with her explorative wings.\n", "val": 0.02259480021893978}

Svendsen, PRAY'R will be released shortly and it is my guess that this composition will become an international 'anthem' from which we all will draw enormous inspiration. Keep in touch to learn more about my full feature conversation with Micheal on One Voice From Africa. If PRAY'R is a sampling of what is to come on the rest of the album, I'd have to add that we're in for an incredible, chilling experience that will not just reach out but touch the very core of our souls!\n", "val": 0.027657266706228256}

I think they where trying add Grieg's Piano concerto but that somehow got mixed up with Beethoven. A mistake that should be fixed.The selections for the album I must say where a bit disappointing and misleading. Now do not get me wrong all the pieces in the album are wonderful its just that i expected more. Most of the pieces in the album are Moderato and below. Not much of a fan of slow pieces, even though they excrete beauty. I prefer the more up beat exiting pieces. But thats just me.When i hear piano masterpieces i think Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor (his only Piano concerto), Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 Liszt, a few Hungarian Dances by Brahms, or some Rachmaninoff. Things of that sort.While i may not agree with the choices i do like the fact that it is 2.99 +tax for 99 pieces. Main reason i gave it four stars.The selections could be better but they are still very nice.

{"text": "I have been turning more toward solo piano music lately, and this collection is a welcome bargain that features mainly very solid performances.The artists are generally excellent performers, but not the most famous names -- with one major exception, as Hungary's Jeno Jando features most prominently in the set, with 29 tracks. I consider him an international A-list pianist -- not that I'm an expert, but Jando is certainly the real deal.French pianist Evelyne Dubourg, who has recorded quite a bit on the Tudor label, is the second most featured artist, on 15 tracks, and performs very well. I also found the playing on the six tracks by Peter Rsel very engaging.There are a few problems, however. For one, track No. 7, which is supposed to be the 2nd movement of Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto Op. 16, is in fact a repeat of track No. 1, the famous bit from Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. (Update: I understand this has now been corrected -- check the samples to make sure.)There are also a few technical glitches, like a distracting \"click\" on the fade out on track 11 (Robert Schumann's \"Trumerei\"), at 3:03. Track 69, the 2nd movement of Schubert's Piano Sonata in Am, has some serious noise issues, especially at about 2:40. A little more care in production could have caught mistakes like these.Also, it's a shame that on orchestral pieces (excerpts from piano concertos and the like), only the names of the orchestras are listed. It is customary to credit the soloist as well, and not doing so is, well, impolite.Finally, buyers of previous sets from Cobra Entertainment will face a high repetition rate. I have only purchased two of their sets previously --&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/99-Must-Have-Chillout-Classics/dp/B0051QU0M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">99 Must-Have Chillout Classics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/99-Must-Have-Mozart-Masterpieces/dp/B0051U6XZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">99 Must-Have Mozart Masterpieces</a>&nbsp;-- and already this collection gives me 36 tracks that are outright repeats of performances from those other sets. (The large majority of the repeats are from the \"Chillout\" set.) While I realize that content providers make their living by repackaging and reselling content, this kind of repeat rate after so few purchases appears to bode poorly for the future.That all being said, is this set worth the introductory price of $1.99? You betcha, and then some. This is great music and overall, highly recommended. Plenty of \"greatest hits\" that everyone will recognize, but also many well-performed gems that are a little more off the beaten path.

{"text": "I have been following Marina Vs career for many years now and after the release of her other independent albums with some killer singles on them: Marina has released a new record of songs \"My Star\".  Marina's albums are always lovely with a great mix of piano melody, interesting lyrics and fantastic Russian language songs. \"My Star\" is a big move forward. The single `You Make Me Beautiful' has been a finalist with youbloom -against some very good up and coming songwriters. The song is classic Marina. Its catchy and massively appealing with that big hook in the chorus, but the song retains its edge. The rest of the album songs like `Unbalanced' and `Thursday Song' stand out. The thing about Marina V is her powerful voice and her ability to carry the spirit of the song completely on her vocals as you can hear on the capella track `Tonkaya Ryabina'. The last track `Magical Christmas' is a showcase of Marina's skill on the piano and a beautiful way to end the album. May Marina keep shining on.\n", "val": 0.041694849729537964}

The whole album is full of Marina's usual songs of observation and introspection on her life and the world around her.

And at the end we get a little bonus Christmas song. Buy and enjoy.\n", "val": 0.03365868330001831}
{"text": "\"My Star\" is Marina V's best album yet!  I've followed Marina V's career ever since interviewing her for the first time as a reporter for NBC back in 2000.  She keeps getting better and better with every release.  With her amazing voice, Marina can do everything from belt out a pop dance number to a soulful ballad.  Folk music from the 60's, rock music from the 70's, dance pop from the 80's and 90's, and even a few songs in her native Russian.  \"My Star\" is a brilliant combination of all these styles.The album starts off with \"You Make Me Beautiful\", a rhythmic ballad that speaks to the power of positivity that one special person can have in our lives.  Second up is \"Thursday Song\", a soulful tune with wonderful lyrics about listening to what your friends need.  \"Blue For You\" talks about being so connected with someone that you can feel what they are feeling.  The title track, \"My Star\" showcases both Marina's voice and keyboard skills with lyrics about being someone else's star when they need guidance.  \"Killing My Dream\" is self-explanatory, a tune about how holding on to negative feelings can be the most devastating to a person's dreams.  Marina then switches gears to cover the Guns'n'Roses ballad \"Don't Cry\", a song about holding your head high when a relationship ends.  \"Unbalanced\" picks up the pace with a great rock rhythm, as Marina sings about staying sane even when the world seems to lose its mind.  My personal favorite track on the album, \"Weight of the World\", shows what you can see behind the faade of the people around you when you really look.  \"Tonkaya Ryabina\", an amazingly soulful a cappella ballad in her native Russian that makes one feel Marina is speaking to them even if you don't understand the words.  The album ends with \"Magical Christmas\", a holiday tune that speaks to the power that the holidays have in bringing out the best in all of us.I am continually impressed by what Marina can do with her talents, whether that talent is her voice or her playing.  Having known Marina and her husband Nick Baker for a decade now, I can tell you that their music comes from the heart and will go straight to yours.  \"My Star\" will begin a musical journey for you into the rest of Marina's songbook that you will never regret.  Marina's self-description reads \"if the Beatles and Tori Amos had a Russian child raised by Tchaikovsky.\"  I couldn't agree more...you will love Marina V!\n", "val": 0.036443497985601425}

{"text": "Let's start with the obvious. If this album had physically come out in 2009, \"You Make Me Beautiful\" would have been at the top of my Best Songs of the Year list. . . but that just means it'll top 2010's list. Despite previous faves like \"Ocean,\" \"Walk Away,\" and \"Underneath Your Sky,\" this song is most likely my new Marina favorite.The first word that comes to my mind when I hear \"Thursday Song\" is \"wistful.\" I know there's a story to the title, but I don't remember it. \"I won't turn my back on you\" makes it basically a song about trust, and with its languid acoustic guitar and occasional mournful keyboard, it's a song to play for your friends rather than hear it on the radio. . . unless there's a channel for that on satellite, probably in the 1000s.\"Blue For You\" is very similar to the previous song from a musical standpoint, and it surprises me these two are back-to-back. Though this one does have drums. The lyrics are more lovelorn than wistful this time, not a typical Marina trope, but a fun change nevertheless.In tone, at least at the beginning, \"My Star\" reminds me of the ghost story from the previous album, but kicks up with drums and a Wurlitzer-type keyboard and occasional, barely there, strings. \"When the sun goes down, I'll be there if you fall\" makes me think the lyrics are similar to Thursday Song, but there's more urgency, almost a desperation, to the pleas. Again, it's not typical Marina, not her usual introspective thinking, like the next one, but that's certainly not bad.This is the third version of \"Killing My Dream\" on Marina's CDs, though in all fairness one was live. I used the word mournful earlier, but that would better describe the original version. Considering the topic, and you get the idea from the title, this almost sounds poppy in comparison, with a sparse albeit kinda jazzy electric guitar. It's kinda jarring if you've heard it so many times before as I have, but if you haven't. . . it's new to you, as the TV networks try to sell ya to watch their repeats.\"Don't Cry\" is yet another slow ballad, similar musically and even lyrically, but mostly in feeling. (Yes, I know it's a cover, but there's still a reason why it was chosen for the album.) It forms a nice little trilogy with Thursday Song and Blue For You, if you can imagine Marina singing all three to the same person. Not being much of a Guns n Roses fan, I think it's easy enough to say I like Marina's voice better. . .\"Unbalanced\" is one of my favorites live, because it looks like Marina's having so much fun--she gets to really rock out (instead of just \"soft-rock\" out). The Wurlitzer-like effect that Shannon Hurley does in concert is not present here, though, which I think is too bad for those of us who have heard it so often, but otherwise it's nice to have this, even if it's really not that different than the live version on her previous CD (except for the lack of a momentary pause before \"So unbalanced\"). And I hope I'm not one of those \"friends\" who is more screwed up than she is!\"Weight of the World\" brings us back to Marina's signature soft-rock. I don't remember if this is the one she says is Beatles-inspired, but it sure sounds like it could be. She does some things with her voice I don't remember hearing before, and I definitely like the stop when she sings \"Stop!\" This is just so perfect quintessential Marina that I can't think of much else to say.As Marina fans know, she includes a traditional Russian song on every album, like \"Babushka\" on the last one. This time we get \"Tonkaya Ryabina,\" incredibly haunting because she does it a cappella. I first heard this at the Pasadena library where she sat on the lip of the stage and somehow managed to sound so amazingly beautiful and creep me out at the same time. (Plus I got a great shot of her getting up after that, in those thigh-high black boots!)If ever there was a song that could be defined as a Christmas ballad, it's this one, \"Magical Christmas.\" Personally I can't stand Christmas music, but if this had a different theme I'm sure I would like it. Nuff said.So yeah, go buy it. . .;o)\n", "val": 0.006121645215898752}

Bohemian Rhapsody broke new ground in its time and is said to have been the single most song to produce at the time of its release. The song features opera chorus music and innovative choral arrangements not usually found in a Rock N Roll format. The timing is magnificent and when the electric guitars enter the scene they really cut loose with wild abandon with ferocious vocals to boot. This is a great song that I sometimes stop to appreciate. Because it got so much play, I actually avoided the song for awhile but today I find myself able to enjoy it anew. This song should definitely be a part of any comprehensive Rock N Roll collection.\n", "val": 0.044258084148168564}

{"text": "I rated Chameleon Circuit's first album at 4 stars, because I knew there was room for improvement.Well, they really got things together for this album, and I happily give it 5 stars! The first album had a couple songs that seemed a little more \"miss\" than \"hit\"....but not with this one. Everything feels more tightly put together and the whole album flows together well.Where the first album was more \"fun\" this one definitely angles more toward \"epic\". A few songs are borderline heavy metal. However, the boys (and girl) still made sure to keep this album in the quirky feel of the series. \"Traveling Man\" has more than a touch of reggae. \"Still Not Ginger\" is just wonderfully silly (\"Fish fingers and mustard, I've got a feeling they'd be better with custard...\").Other favorites are \"Kiss the Girl\", \"Everything is Ending\" (which features CC's first female vocalist), and \"The Sound of Drums\".Worth buying for any Doctor Who fan! Also, I have to thank this band for getting me into Doctor Who. I watched Alex Day's \"Alex Reads Twilight\" video's on YouTube, began watching his regular videos, and then the videos of his buddies....Finally, I thought, \"Well, clearly if these boys are all crazy about this Doctor Who show, I need to watch it.\" So I did, and here I am!\n", "val": 0.02415980026125908}

And don't forget those cute little accents.Much of the motifs and effects that are used on this album are magnificent.

{"text": "New Found Glory keeps reinventing themselves every album and it really keeps all of those who love them on our toes. Nothing Gold Can Stay showed us a band that could clearly write catchy songs. Once they polished themselves and came out with the Self Titled album we saw them adding a little bit of riffing and rock to their pop punk roots. So it would go until they came out with Coming Home. I maintain that this is still an amazing album. For people looking for the double time pop punk gems this maybe fell short. However, if you are looking at it from a songwriting and truly personal lyrics stand point it's a great record. Going back to their roots of the Self Titled they came out with Not WIthout a Fight. Again great pop rock songs with a pop punk edge. What makes New Found Glory great is the fact that their not a pop punk band. They take all the great elements of punk, pop, rock, hardcore and other styles to make up one great sound.This brings us to Radiosurgery......This is a great album of pop rock awesomeness. I say this because I really don't see them as a punk band from a musician stand point. They are very well versed in all musical styles, which makes them able to put out songs that encompass all genres. This is just a flat out good pop rock album. They were going for an album of catchy radio friendly songs and they succeeded with just that. Thank you New Found Glory for another great album! The songs that seem to stick out to me are: Summer Fling, Don't Mean a Thing, Caught in the Act, Radiosurgery, and I'm Not the One. However, every song is great!\n", "val": 0.026779990643262863}

{"text": "There was a time not too long ago, from about 2000-2006, when you could not avoid pop punk. The bands that played this type of music were everywhere, and new bands were coming out of the woodwork every day it seemed. New Found Glory were among the poineers of these bands, arriving on the scene around 1999, just as this style of music was breaking through. The genre went through changes, with sunny pop-punk slowly being replaced by emo/screamo, and eventually, a whole new crop of younger bands started to push the old ones away. New Found Glory has never gone away, and as a matter of fact, their last album (2009's \"Not Without A Fight\") was one of their most honest and straightforward efforts. In order for a band to survive these constant changes in the scene, they need to keep making good records.And Radiosurgery is good. It is DARN good. As a matter of fact, it just might be the band's best yet. Opting to return to the sound of their earlier albums, NFG has picked up the tempo even more this time around, and the songwriting is spot-on. Some of the tracks are a little on the poppy side, such as the title track and first single \"Radiosurgery.\" Others hit hard with a refreshing blast of punk energy (the cover version of \"Blitzkreig Pop\" is one of the best punk covers I've ever heard.) Literally, out of fifteen tracks, thirteen are near exceptional. This stands out as the only NFG album to not have any bad songs; they really got it right this time around. Jordan Pundik's vocals are great throughout, and Chad Gilbert attacks these songs like it was his last day on earth, making the album sound immediate, but still lots of fun.On the inside cover of this album, it reads \"Pop Punk is Not Dead.\" A trio of great albums over the past several months by Blink 182, Simple Plan, and now New Found Glory seems to confirm that statement. This is one of those albums, like Green Day's \"Dookie,\" that is worth buying the physical CD and keeping it in your collection for years. I'd run through each song but you know what the band sounds like, and believe me, you will not be disappointed. In my review of \"Not Without A Fight,\" I stated that NFG had an exceptional album hidden within them somewhere; an album where everything clicked, and the whole thing sounded great. This is their moment. And it does not matter that it came in 2011 instead of 2001, or any other time in between. Pop punk may or may not be dead, but New Found Glory is alive and well.\n", "val": 0.03308921679854393}

It's beyond noir -- it's Sophoclean.I also think that this is Jerry Goldsmith's best script: romantic, elegiac, haunting.

The justly famous, and much immitated opening of the incredible main title with it's mournful, tilting, trumpet anthem, as rich and warm as dark coffee and bourbon, the sparse, almost neo classical sounscapes, Noahs Cross, The Boy On A Horse, reveal Goldsmith in his most beguiling mode of instrumental smoke and shadow.

{"text": "I read a review that stated: \"Madame Palindrone fuses `90s acid jazz and `80s new age dance music with elements of modern day chillout, lounge, and progressive soul...\" and I certainly agree as I listen to this 11-track set.Because of a lack of promotion for the truly talented soul/r&b singers, I only discovered Deborah Bond via a video for SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS, a track from her debut album, DAYAFTER. The songs on this album display what is missed on radio today - melodic, rhythmic music with no HIP HOP beats and (oh my) NO RAPPERS!!!!  Music that features thinking, uplifting lyrics about love - for self, the world & others which is also sorely missing in music today (specifically the r&b genre). In addition to her unique vocal style, I love the fact that Deborah like Sade has her own backing band which I'm sure will help continue to create her signature sound.This is a \"no skipping required\" collection that puts me in a good mood whenever I hear it and my favorite tracks are:IF I DIDN'T NEED YOU w/ Lewis TaylorSAY ITNOTHING MATTERSBLIND PARADISE - funky arrangement with intelligent lyrics about the state of today's music industryPERFECT5:35I highly recommend this collection if your soul has been pining away for good r&b music, it is exceptional.\n", "val": 0.006544280331581831}

{"text": "I had a relationship I alluded to in my review of \"Authenticity\" last year. One of the takeaways from that relationship was that she put me on to a local artist named Deborah (pronounced De-BOR-uh) Bond. I heard her first album, DayAfter, in 2003 and was blown away. Like a latter day Sade and Sweetback, Deborah and her band Third Logic took you on a socially conscious, jazzy, funky, r & b-y (it's not a word, I know) journey. It was one of my first forays into true indie soul, which I now love. 5 years passed before I started seeing the video for \"See You in My Dreams\" ([...] in rotation on any station. Meanwhile, I (and other fans) salivated, waiting for a follow-up to DayAfter. It arrived this summer in the form of Madam Palindrome, another genre-blending cornucopia of good music. From the pulsating rhythms of \"Nothing Matters\" at the beginning, all the way to the melancholy reflections of Never Was at the end, this album is one of the best of 2011, and you've probably never heard it. Here's my track by track review: 1. Nothing Matters-The opening song sets the tone for the whole album as Deborah implores you to \"sit back, relax, and enjoy this funky cosmic ride.\" It speaks of a torrid love affair, the kind where the only thing that matters is the two of you, an ode to keeping an open mind in love. The track is mid-tempo and lush from the opening chords 2. Perfect-A slowed down ode to being grateful for your blessings, powered by double bass and keyboards. A great example of Deborah's strong song-writing. The song is versatile enough that I could picture the song being played at church (I go to a REALLY non-traditional church) or potentially as a wedding song. 3. Blind Paradise-This song, which starts with a 45 second instrumental/party scene, could almost be looked at as a spiritual sequel to another DC product's (Marvin Gaye) \"What's Going On\" 4. Think Twice-Another slower song (this one's reminiscent of a spoken word tradition) that speaks of introspection and again being grateful for what we have, warning against the perils of self-absorption 5. Highest Mountain-A mid-tempo, inspirational track tailor-made for a recession that encourages you to focus on what really matters in life over a dreamy, laid back track 6. If I Didn't Need You (ft. Lewis Taylor)-This uptempo track featuring legendary British musician Lewis Taylor feels very much like a mid-80s throwback, with a playful back and forth, he said, she said between DeBo and Taylor. Great chemistry in this duet! 7. 5:35-Okay, so Issa Rae's Awkward Black Girl character J has a penchant for writing violent raps...my personal music foible is to create 16 bars for a hypothetical remix. This song is one of those that I not only want to guest on the remix for (complete with a reference to her sleeping in my underwear!), but also a song I wish my wife sang about me! We all know the feeling, being in love, and can't wait until quitting time to see your paramour. This song captures that aesthetic very well, over a funky uptempo track. 8. Say It-Probably my favorite track on the album, I love how Deborah lets the band play for nearly a minute, letting you savor the music before dropping dreamy vocals. It's a story that's been told in music before, about seeing love for the first time in someone who's been there all along 9. You Are The One-The lead single, this mid-tempo track never ceases to make me smile, even after listening to it 4055 times. Deborah's joy is palpable and you can feel it as she sings about her lover and the growth of their relationship. If you ever feel down on the concept of love, play this song and it will renew your faith in the possibility of love! 10. Mr. Day's Dream-You're not supposed to use a term to define said term, but this mostly instrumental track feels like a dream, seamlessly blending violin solos, guitar solos, unintelligible robotic voices, and chants....cool, atmospheric music 11. Never Was-Remember the joy from \"You are the One?\" Yeah, you tend to hope that she's talking about a different relationship from the one in that one, with Deborah reflecting on a lost love, feeling at turns philosophical and at turns foolish, while feeling melancholy all the way through, and trying to decide whether to give the relationship another try.Overall, this superlative effort was ambitious in its blending of musical styles and knocked it out of the park. As with any indie release, it hasn't gotten quite the buzz it deserves, though I hear it's doing quite well in Europe. The video for \"You Are The One\" is in decent rotation on VH1 Soul, however. If you love soul, you will love this album...it's well worth the purchase! [...]\n", "val": 0.008533384650945663}

{"text": "What happened? Oh... I know what happened... I blinked... I have to quit doing that... everytime I blink I experience inexorably ubiquitous temporal displacement... seems like Summer just began... now it draws to a close (it's already the middle of August?????)... that magical time of year (as described in previous reviews)... gloriously warm/hot weather... the pool... long walks through \"Arne Darvin\" park with \"Tabby\"... the pool... unsuccessful U.F.O test flights (with two different craft now!!!)... long walks through \"Allister Crowley\" park with \"Tabby\"... the pool... those palm trees hanging in the surreal, indigo/cerulean morning sky... the pool... those interstellar, sparkling jewels hanging in the obsidian/onyx night sky... total immersion in a musical world... AHHH... excellent segue... the early morning \"MOOD SETTING\" music... P. Glass' magnificent soundtrack to KOYAANISQATSI: the Hopi word for \"life out of balance\"... somewhat of a staggering contradiction since this season seems to place me at the antithesis of an unbalanced life... what better to keep that life in balance during this time of year than the outstanding music of CCR?Let's take the \"WAY BACK\" machine to the early '70s... I'll never forget the highlight of my visits to a certain pizza parlor... they had a jukebox (magic!!!)... and contained therein was one of my earliest favorite tunes: UP AROUND THE BEND (I still love that one)... that opening distorted guitar motif pulled me right in: \"There's a place up ahead that I'm going\"... that place is the genius of this group, and Fogerty's unprecedented song writing ability... AH HA... there is a nexus... Fogerty had the envious skill of doing a lot with a little... JUST LIKE THE MINIMALIST COMPOSITIONS OF P. GLASS!!!Let me expand on that: PROUD MARY (another CCR gem) is an excellent representative tune to illustrate Fogerty's skill at creating socially relevant, politically thoughtful, catchy, memorable, radio friendly, timeless, terse, and concise (hmmmmmmmm... what would you call CCR? Pop/Folk/Country rock????... even my mother loves them!!!!) songs... the simple four to the floor drumming supported fantastically by the other half of the rhythm section (bass), along with the creative guitar interplay narrated by Fogerty's unique, passionate, gritty vocals made for one formidable band...I would highly suggest both of their \"CHRONICLE\" compilations, yet if you'd like some individual samples, acquire the following:PROUD MARY, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE RAIN (my personal favorite), BORN ON THE BAYOU, GREEN RIVER, UP AROUND THE BEND (ahhhhh... \"Amnesia Lane\"), LODI, THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL, FORTUNATE SON, and BAD MOON RISING (really... CCR fans? There are literally too many to mention)...I read a great book about the band... very impressed that they treated work in a 9-5 fashion... they handled the business end for the first part of the day, then rehearsed after the \"lunch break\" until the end of the day... the most frustrating thing was that a lot of their hits stalled at NUMBER 2!!!! (then again, the competition at the time included The Beatles)...With regard to Summer drawing to a close, I'll quote Dr. Who when facing the weeping angels: \"DON'T BLINK!!!!\"...Here's my farewell statement to this Summer:\"The pine smells sweet in the frozen air... your silhouette's just fading there... the wolves crash close against the snow, but where we're running I don't know... in villages and soft, sad towns... candles sway as night comes down... cold boats creak... strange beasts cry... watching shadows in the sky... all I have... all I need... all I've got is providence\"With regard to CCR... Balthazar says \"CHECK THEM OUT!!\"The early morning \"MOOD SETTING\" music has just shifted into Led Zeppelin's ACHILLES LAST STAND (Page produced one of his best guitar tones on this CD [PRESENCE])... another nexus? This reflected Plant's fear that he would never walk again following that car accident in Greece... the \"mighty arms of Atlas\" held him up, and he defeated despair! If you're a kindred spirit, don't weep as Summer eludes our grasp... listen to CCR and your life will be \"balanced\", AND Atlas will hold your spirits up!!!Peace, long life, love, happiness...Balthazar \"AIR COOL\" Platini, III\n", "val": 0.007962523959577084}

This CD is full of great melodies and awesome breaks, and most importantly, IT GROOVES!!!!!  Her voice  soars and gently sways on every song.  My favorite tracks are the title track, \"Softly as a Morning Sunrise\" and \"Caravan!\"  First of all, \"Caravan\" is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!  It exploits the tune's middle-eastern harmonies and feel and takes it to a whole new level, AND is just plain sexy!!!  \"Softly As in a Morning Sunrise\" is done as a Danzon/Cha cha, which is super cool.  \"Alfonsina y el Mar\" is gorgeous!!  \"Birds in Flight,\" the title track of the album is KILLER tune perfect for salsa dancing!  Also, Kat has an all-star cast backing her up...I can't name everybody off the top of my head, but theres Wayne Wallace on trombone (he also produced and arranged the album), Rick Vandivier on guitar, Paul van Wageningen on drumset, Michael Spiro on percussion, John Worley on trumpet, and a TON of other AMAZING musicians, playing bass, flute, violin, cello, bata, tablas, and a bunch of other instruments that are the icing, sprinkles, gummybears, ETC on the sweet, sweet cake that is this CD!!

{"text": "I recently saw Motorhead, who were touring to support this album [although, strangely, not playing more than one track from it--do they think we are that conservative--or was Another Perfect Day *that* traumatic?!]. Anyway, this completes a near-perfect trio of releases produced by Cameron Webb, that starts with Inferno and then includes Kiss of Death. It is not as innovative or powerful as Inferno, which is for me simply the best thing they have *ever* done. Ever. But it is a great piece of work. On this theme, let me correct something recently written by Alex Henderson, who offers this: \"....the classic Motrhead sound prevails, and forceful, in-your-face tracks such as \"Buried Alive,\" \"Runaround Man,\" \"When the Eagle Screams,\" and \"Time Is Right\" sound like they could have been recorded 25 years earlier... Motorizer falls short of essential and isn't quite in a class with Motrhead's best late-'70s/early-'80s output, but this album is definitely respectable -- and it is good to see this seminal thrash/speed trio still plugging away after so many years in metal's trenches\". While his last comment is clearly correct, the rest is not. The difference between this and 'the old stuff' is threefold--the musicianship is better, the production is better, and the songs themselves are way better. Lemmy's lyrics could be pretty flimsy, but these days they are actually about something and either pretty funny or pretty thought-provoking. That's not always true--English Rose is a re-make of Christine, and that really didn't need re-working. But for the most part, this is an A- album that's streets ahead of most of the stuff in the genre.\n", "val": 0.01615426316857338}
{"text": "How can a band put out an album every two years for three decades and manage to make a winner every time?  Sure, some Motorhead albums are better than others, but I can't think of a single one that stands out like a missing tooth in their canon.  AC/DC has Blow Your Video, Machine Head has Supercharger, Metallica has their entire post Black Album career.  Motorhead has none of those.  Motorizer not only continues the awesome trend of consistent music, it proves to be a nice change of pace.This isn't to say that Motorhead has changed their sound.  I'm pretty sure that'll never happen (but with Motorhead, that's a good thing.)  What's great about Motorizer is that it is that the album is seamless.  There are no ballads, no covers, no blues songs.  Every track is straightforward Motorhead goodness, each with a blend of metal, punk and good old fashioned rock.  That's not to say I don't like their ballads or their blues tracks, but the format makes this album a very consistent listening experience.  It manages to rock out on every track yet not sound repetitive.The band members themselves are in top form, as always.  Lemmy sounds exactly the same as he did in '77 and I can't think of any other vocalists that can say the same.  His bass playing is phenomenal as well.  Micky Dee is an insane drummer, and I'm not one that generally pays too much attention to drumming.  But I've seen this band live and I've seen this guy pull off a ten minute solo and he's the real deal, definitely one of my favorite drummers.  Phil Campbell is a great guitarist, infusing the blues into every bit of metal.  All of my favorite Motorhead records feature him on strings.In good punk-like fashion, Motorizer is short and to the point, with only one track that breaks 4 minutes.  This also isn't a bad thing.  The album doesn't overstay its welcome and by the time it ends, you're wanting more.  Luckily you can just play it a second time.The opening track, Runaround Man is awesome, in standard Motorhead opening track fashion.  It'll pump you up for the rest of the record.  All of the tracks are great, but other gems are When the Eagle Screams, One Short Life, Buried Alive and Heroes.The weird thing is, the first couple of times I spun this album I wasn't feeling it.  I think it's because it didn't have riffs that hooked me immediately like Bastards or Inferno.  I was being impatient and skipping tracks, looking for something that stood out.  Don't be like me and do the same thing.  I put on the record again, driving this time which may have helped, and realized it kicks a**.  It might not have a single like Ace of Spades, but Motorizer has quickly moved its way into my top 5 Motorhead albums, up there with We Are Motorhead and Bastards.  Do yourself a favor and buy this instead of the new Metallica album.  Motorhead will never die!\n", "val": 0.029855472967028618}
{"text": "Motorhead-Motorizer ****1/2Upon first listen Motorizer feels like just another Motorhead album. Yeah, a great motorhead album, well then again Motorhead never really made a bad album did they? Moving on...As you give the album time it seems to grow better with each listen. As Lemmy's lyrics become more recognizable to you the songs seem better that usual. Lemmy really stepped up the lyrics for Motorizer; they are both very personal and intelligent. His bass playing is exception as well ('When The Eagle Screams') much better than usual. Philip Campbell shows his merit here as well. His Wah-Wah tone makes his guitar scream and his riffs are solid and his solos kill! Mikkey Dee proves once again that he just might be the very best drummer in rock n' roll today. This is really his album.'Runaround Man' is classic Motorhead destined to be a fan favorite as is 'Rock Out.' The latter being very Ramones influenced adding an extra layer of awesome. 'English Rose' kills just about anything out today and 'The Thousand Names Of God' is among the strongest sets of lyrics Lemmy has ever set to paper. 'When The Eagle Screams' is by far the strongest track on the album. Both musically, and lyrically it destroys.

{"text": "Lemmy must have been into heavy doses of the Ramones while recording this album, because his love for the band is quite evident throughout \"Motorizer\".  In fact there is a fast paced, \"punk\" rock vibe to many of the songs here in the \"Goin' To Brazil\" & \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S\" vein. \"Rock Out\" does exactly what it promises and then some.  Mickey Dee's drumming propels the album from start to finish without pause (no slowed down ballads here).  Dee is arguably the best drummer in rock/metal and he proves it here.  And friggin' Phil, the man never ceases to amaze me; his playing just keeps getting better. Phil takes his own chops, blends in a wee-wee bit of Chuck Berry, a heavy dose of Thin Lizzy era Brian Robertson (Phil's wah wah pedal tone is killer on this album) and consequently churns out  guitar solos and fills that are short, sweet and very wicked.  Then you have Lemmy.....'nuff said.  I am a longtime fan dating back to the vinyl days.  I would hesitate to put \"Motorizer\" up there with classics like \"Overkill\" and \"Ace Of Spades\", but it is darn close.A great place to start for a newcomer to the band and a definite \"add to cart\" for current Motorhead fans.\n", "val": 0.02467280812561512}

Do I dare say dipping in mainstream just toes in though. Abou the only track I don't care for is English Rose similar to Christine on Kiss of Death but no where near as good. Although it will probablly grow on me. I would like to mention however i have given the album a good 40 listens so far. well lets start shall we. I think the album is somewhat similar to Kiss of Death overall I would say not as good but if you like Kiss of Death you'll like this one too.1. \"Runaround Man\"  more of a punk sound similar to \"sucker\" on Kiss of Death2. \"Teach you how to sing the blues\" all I can say is absoultly amazing the riff in the chourus is just flat out filthy and catchy3. \"When The Eagle Screams\" fast great solos4. \"Rock Out\" I will admit to not being to fond of this the first listen but it grew on me. It just sounded a little to commercial at first but hey I now like it. You here a the bass line sounds very similar to that of Kingdom of the worm of Kiss Of Death.5. \"One Short Life\" my personal favorite from the album and it has some pretty good lyrics too not to mention my favorite riffs off the album.6. \"Buried Alive\" another track a remeber not really liking at first but grew on me and now one of my fav's good hard rockin out!!!7. \"English Rose\" the killer for me I just don't like it I think the lyrics are something you wouldnt expect to hear from Lem my only real beef with the album \"CHRISTINE\" was a much better song and even \"ONE NIGHT STAND\"8. \"Back On The Chain\" another rockin track pretty good solos9. \"Heros\" has a little bit of a different sound to it but all for the better,,, a little slower paced but non the less a great song10. \"Time is Right\" takes time to grow on you it took a few listens for me to like this but again with any metal/heavy album I think they need to be played thru a few times to make an anlyasis on them..11. \"Thousand Names Of God\" a cool sound to it sounds a little similar to \"Slow Dance\" off We Are Motorheadoverall I would say that this will recieve a lot of spin time in the cd player however I like INFERNO and KISS OF DEATH better......

{"text": "No surprises here for long time Motorhead fans, \"Motorizer\" is yet another slamming bluesy hard as hell rock and roll album for Lemmy Kilmister and his bandmates.  Like AC/DC before him, Kilmister has always known his strengths, and consistently delivered pretty much the same type of album from day one, full of bluster and sloppy during the Fast Eddie/Philthy Animal Taylor years, and growing into more musical territory without sacrificing one bite.  \"Motorizer\" is a fine later period Motorhead CD, but then again, they all are.  Phil Campbell is the longest serving guitarist in the band and is as beloved as Clarke, maybe more so.  Mickey Dee is tight as hell, and it's this lineup that has consistently outrocked everybody.  Lemmy's lyrics are more pointed, politically and socially, but like on \"English Rose\", his love for the ladies is still present, albeit in a tongue in cheek way.  Kilmister has long hated religion and closes out with \"The Thousand Names of God\", further attacking an institution he views as one of the most terrible concepts ever devised.  \"Motorizer\" is a fast paced blistering rocker that Motorheadbangers should have if they don't.

How they get so many different rythmns and riffs out of 3 guys and continued to roll out cd after cd is amazing. I also have to say that another thing that I love about Lemmie is that his lyrics make me laugh outloud at times, I don't know about others but some of his lines are just ridiculously funny to me. MY bud in the local music store agrees with me, I was afraid to say anything at first but once I did he immeadiately agreed. Yes in my opinion Motorhead helps ya relieve stress full out rock n roll with songs that cover the human experience good and bad and you can laugh too.

{"text": "One of the coolest things about being one of the best and most original, seminal, untrendy, and influential things to happen to the world of heavy music is having the right to play it safe. And having a free pass to make the same album again and again? That's okay, too. Nobody illustrates this point better than Motorhead. Ever since the date of their inception way back in 1977, this band's sound (which is first and foremost rooted in fast and heavy metal - including thrash, speed, groove, and traditional metal -- yet is also poised with enough restraint and memorable melodies to add dynamic and keep things from getting out of control - and is tinged with punk, hard rock, and even some blues and Southern rock elements) has essentially remained the same. Nonetheless, it is a very potent, catchy, hard rocking, strongly grooving, and contagiously fun sound...so, all is forgiven. Plus, all of their releases come with a stamp of guaranteed quality. In other words, for a long time now, Motorhead have had a fairly high level of excellence looming overhead. And they have always met or exceeded that standard by, time-after-time, kicking out one undeniably good record after another. (This has been the case for so long that it has become almost like clockwork.) Hence, this Birmingham-based trio may not try overly hard or do much in the way of converting non-fans, but one would be exceedingly hard-pressed to find a more consistent band, or one with a more epic discography.And even after all these years, full-length release number 500 (okay, okay, 19), 2008's \"Motorizer,\" finds vocalist/bassist Lemmy Kilmeister, guitarist Phil Campbell, and drummer Mikkey Dee still sticking with their guns (i.e. the tried and true formula that has gotten them this far). And as usual, no time is wasted in getting right into the thick of things, thanks to a vintage ripper (and probably soon-to-be concert staple) like \"Runaround Man.\" It is an excellent opening blast of all the usual good stuff, including: An energetic snare drum intro, corrosive thrash grooves, punk-flavored rhythms, and yet another all around top-notch performance from the frontman (it is filled with lots of terrifically infectious singing and lyrics.) Meanwhile, the guitars blaze and shred throughout, with a dazzling showcase of blistering riffage and a wild solo. However, once \"Runaround Man\" draws to a close, things suddenly settle way down. \"(Teach You How To) Sing The Blues\" has concertedly restrained chugging anchored by thunderous and commanding bass grooves. The tune is also of note because (as if its name weren't a dead give away), it finds Motorhead's non-metal influences shifting to the forefront - as evidenced by its fluid and positively bluesy guitar soloing. Later on, \"One Short Life,\" works similarly, with its tasty guitar crunch and industrial-strength, churning rhythms, opts for a mid-tempo, groove-oriented approach complete with ample tasty guitar crunch, industrial-strength, churning rhythms, and really thick, driving, dirty/downtuned/grungy-sounding bass lines.On that note, there is only one other slow moment to be found here. Track nine, \"Heroes,\" blurs the line between being a near-balladry and leather-clad hard rock. A bit of blues also enters the fray during a superb bit of nicely clean soloing near the end. But no matter what genre the song falls under, it is easy to like, thanks to Lemmy's classic phlegm-flecked sing-speak vocals intertwined with borderline-clean singing, a funky bass bottom, AC-DC-esque rock `n' roll beat, and the aforementioned solo section. Back on more familiar ground, it is on the fairly thunderous \"When The Jungle Screams\" (which boasts crunchy, deft, machine-gun riffing, bouncy drumming, and a great chorus and wailing solo to boot), \"Buried Alive,\" the rhythmically stomping \"Back On The Chain,\" and \"Heroes\" that Motorhead unabashedly let their fiery, full-blast, mosh-pit-friendly tempos rip. And elsewhere, the aptly titled \"Rock Out\" (which has an excellent, hulking -- if familiar -- bass intro in the same vein as prior classics like, say, \"Ace Of Spades\"), \"Time Is Right,\" and the album-closing \"The Thousand Names Of God\" all play like 100% pure, groovy, hard-rocking (and distinctly old-fashioned) speed punk.The bottom line is that \"Motorizer\" never pretends to be groundbreaking, but, to bastardize an old clich, if it ain't broken, why fix it?! This is definitely an impeccably solid and extremely enjoyable affair. But hey, any metalhead worth their salt should have figured-out long ago that it seems physically impossible for Lemmy and the Gang to make anything less!\n", "val": 0.04141158610582352}
{"text": "I grew up with Motorhead. One of my first LPs was Ace of Spades (still got it). Saw them back in the 80s. Recently starting listening to more of my back catalogue the last couple of years, and realised how much I loved this band. Some of their CDs from the 90s were very patchy, but Bastards, Motorizer and We are Motorhead, contain just as many will be classics as their early 80s stuff. Plus, it's all recorded and mastered far better. And the current and longest standing trio plays a lot better and tighter than the 'classic' line up, if truth be told.Motorizer sounds great sonically, and content wise. Runaround Man and Sing The Blues are massive standouts for this listener. This is still Motorhead as you may remember them, but better.And God love Lemmy. I was a big Hawkwind fan, and it was only a couple of years into listening to them I sussed Lemmy was their bass man. Unsurprisingly, my favourite tracks contained some wicked bass lines and therein lies my fondness for Motorhead. Lemmy is 64 going on 21. God knows how he's still alive, never mind cranking out class metal and taking it around the world and back. While Keith Richards is sitting back counting his cash and preening his faux rock n roll cool, Lemmy is the real thing; a bottle of Jack a day,  kicking audiences into next week at night.Hopefully he got more of the same in him because this is quality rock n roll.\n", "val": 0.020530473440885544}
{"text": "There is nothing fancy, sophisticated or classy about Lemmy Kilmister but, in his own words, 'that's the way I like it baby, I don't want to live forever'. And so, whether you are a fan or not of him and his music, there is something fundamentally reassuring about the way in which he and Motorhead never seem to change. 'Motorizer' is as brutal and full of energy as any other Motorhead album over the years and if you've been a long term fan, you will simply lap this album up. Speaking however as someone that can appreciate the great man and his music rather than actually like a lot of it, I don't think that there are any individual tracks here to rival past glories such as 'Ace Of Spades', 'Bomber' or (my personal favourite) 'Killed By Death'. This said, 'The Runaround Man', 'Heroes' and the hilarious 'Rock Out' (with your cock out!) could all become favorites in time. That Lemmy and his band are still producing punishing, aggressive and 'dirty' rock and roll over 30 years into a musical career is a tribute to them and, let's face it, there's no-one that quite 'cranks up the volume' like Motorhead, is there? 'Motorizer' is a solid and consistent set, that delivers EXACTLY what you would expect it to.\n", "val": 0.02504350058734417}

{"text": "Motorizer- Motorhead 2008As the 19th studio album from legendary rockers, Motorhead- Motorizer will not disappoint the tried and true Motorhead fan. The trio has continued to produce cds and albums that are consistent, not wavering too far from the formula that makes Motorhead work.Produced, mixed and engineered by Cameron Webb ( Limp Bizkit, Godsmack, Monster Magnet), Motorizer does evoke a cleaner production sound as compared to earlier releases but thankfully not falling prey to Webb`s alternative roots.Webb accomplishes this without muddying the underlying sound that is singularly Motorhead- in short Webb sharpened some of the edges, gave the cd a bit of shine but didn't clean away all of the \"good stuff\".  The classic Motorhead sound is still there in 11 songs in less than 40 minutes.Notable tracks include \"Buried Alive\", \"Runaround Man\" and \"The Thousand Names of God\".It's fast, it's loud and best of all it is unapologetic.

Lemmy's bass is pumping, Mikkey Dee's drums are pounding, and Phil Campbell's guitar is on fire. \"Teach You How to Sing the Blues\" delivers Lemmy's signature growling vocals. Let's face it, when you hear them, you know it's metal. The track barrels along to a driving chugga-chugga riff. Finally, my favorite college phrase has been immortalized in a Motorhead song. Although the title of the song is \"Rock Out,\" one of the lines in the chorus is 'rock out with your c**k out.' \"Buried Alive\" is just plain brutal. \"English Rose\" delves into the good and bad aspects of a great woman. Motorhead go anthemic on \"Heroes.\" The energy kicks back up with the frantic paced \"Time is Right.\"The BadLemmy, you have to give us more than 41 minutes.The VerdictIf Motorhead is anything, it's consistent.

The current Kilmister-Campbell-Dee Mark III Speed Trio* The Another Perfect Day line-up with Brian Robertson being the rogue album.All three have obviously left their indelible mark on Rock music. However, the current line-up has been together the longest, and have made the most significant and memorable music of the three line-ups.

{"text": "I'm not really sure what happened to my first review on this CD, but I must say that this music is amazing! My first disk came with some manufacturing issues and I mentioned this in my first review. Upon seeing this, the artist, Rahn himself, contacted me via email to let me know that he would be listening through a disk to make sure there were no defects in it and sending out an autographed copy right away! I was ecstatic! My autographed copy arrived within a week. It played flawlessly. I now keep this CD in my van at all times. It plays quietly in the background and keeps me calm while I am driving. The music just flows through the airwaves and seeps into your soul in such a way that you don't even realize you have become one with it. Each piece is distinct and unique, yet they flow together so that you barely notice when one song ends and another begins. There's virtually no break in the meditative state of your mind. I anxiously await future albums from Rahn.DISCLAIMER: I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest, completely unbiased review.

{"text": "\"If Only\" is the debut solo CD by Rahn, a classically-trained pianist and multi-instrumentalist who comes from a musical family and started studying music at a very early age. Rahn is also a rock musician and a commercial sound designer, so it is no surprise that there is a variety of influences in his work. Rahn's nine original piano solos range from slow and flowing to much bigger and more energetic works, giving us a glimpse into his musical sensibilities. He effectively expresses a variety of emotions with his colorful playing style and nimble fingers.\"If Only\" opens with the title track, a gentle daydream of a piece. Wistful and introspective, it's a lovely way to start. \"Ana b'hebbek,\" a loving and graceful ballad, is dedicated to Rahn's mother with his thanks for always believing in him. \"Nahara\" picks up the tempo and intensity, joyfully swirling and dancing around the piano keys. The second movement is much more delicate, with some impressive harp-like passages, and the third movement returns to a bright and energetic tempo, leaving no doubt that this guy knows his way around a piano! \"Karried Away\" is a warm and tender love song - slow and flowing with a romantic melody that comes from the heart. There are several variations on the melody, from sweet and simple to full-out passionate, making this piece a real standout. \"Eudaimonia\" is a Greek word that usually translates as \"happiness,\" and this piece conveys that blissful calm that comes with contentment and inner peace; I hear shades of Yanni here and there. \"Prelude\" is the closing track, and is a bit darker than the other pieces. Very emotional and expressive, I think Rahn saved the best for last. The beginning passages are slow and melancholy, building to a passionate outburst of feeling in the middle, and then  returning to the quieter first movement and trailing off at the end. Love it!\"If Only\" is a very promising debut from an exceptional pianist, so check out Rahn's music. Recommended!\n", "val": 0.049760058522224426}

{"text": "I once read that Mary Hopkin referred to her first album on the Apple Label as being Paul McCartney's but \"Earth Song, Ocean Song\" was her album. Mary Hopkin has released many more albums through her own label and is actively recording. I do like her first Apple album, \"Postcard\" but it is overly produced and the song \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" is filler. This album is much different fare and it is less pop oriented. This is Mary Hopkin's album. Mary Hopkin's voice is absolutely beautiful. It is pure and clear as a bell. On this album without layers of production that suited a Beatles' album, Mary's voice shines on songs such as Ralph McTell's \"Streets of London\" which is exquisite and also on his plaintive \"Silver Birch and Weeping Willow\". Mary gives a gorgeous rendition of Cat Stevens' \"The Wind\".\"Water, Paper and Clay\" is a definite stand-out on this album being more rousing with back-up vocals. Newly added tracks fit in well on this newly re-mastered version especially \"When I Am Old One Day\" and \"Let My Name Be Sorrow\". This album flows beautifully and Mary Hopkin has some of the finest musicians working with her such as David Cousins, Danny Thompson, and Ralph McTell. This album is as fresh as it was upon release. It is a classic. I cannot recommend it highly enough. For more Mary Hopkin albums not available anywhere else, check Mary Hopkin Music. She remains an enormously gifted singer -- songwriter.\n", "val": 0.023201461881399155}
{"text": "After three years of doing pop at Apple, in 1971 Hopkin finally got to show her true colors on her final album there. Musicians and writers like Ralph McTell and Dave Cousins came from the top ranks of contemporary folk. Contributors also included Hopkin's personal favorites, Apple house writers Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle. The exquisite arrangements and Mary's crystal clear voice make for a listening experience you won't forget. There's not a single weak track, highlighted by the beautiful and very environmentally-themed title songs.This collection adds three bonus tracks. \"When I Am Old One Day\" is an outtake first released on the 1994 overseas-only compilation CD \"Those Were the Days.\" \"Kew Gardens\" and \"Let My Name Be Sorrow\" come from Hopkin's next-to-last Apple single. Like the album, these tracks were produced by Hopkin's future (now ex-) husband Tony Visconti.Three other tracks are available exclusively by download; they're listed on Amazon under \"Earth Song - Ocean Song (Bonus Tracks).\" They include \"Jefferson,\" a Gallagher-Lyle tune that was the overseas B-side to \"Water, Paper & Clay,\" and the French and Japanese language versions of \"Let My Name Be Sorrow.\" Most of the other songs Hopkin released as singles, like \"Temma Harbour,\" \"Lontano Dagli Occhi,\" and \"Heritage\" have yet to be released on digital in the U.S. Let's hope that gap is filled soon.\n", "val": 0.008313234895467758}

{"text": "It's hard to know where to begin a review of one's all time favorite album.  Maybe that's the best way to begin, actually.  I probably own around 2,000 albums, featuring most genres and fairly evenly spread from the 1940s to today in terms of when they were recorded.  And \"Earth Song/Ocean Song\" is #1 among them all.That should tell you something, but maybe not enough to decide on buying it for yourself.  So let me tell you a bit more about why I love it so much.  First of all, Mary Hopkin had (and no doubt still has) a terrific voice, and she put it to great use here.  That sugar-sweet sadness you hear on \"Those Were The Days\" is more restrained and mature here, with a breathier quality when it suits the song.  She also sounds much closer up and never drowned out by the music.  And speaking of the music, it's mellow but lush throughout, intense but never too hard.  Themes range from breakups to homelessness to plain old self-awareness, but all the songs seem woven together flawlessly into a cycle that somehow makes perfect sense.The album's centerpieces are its two title songs, written by Liz Thorsen.  Maybe they're both about finding inner peace (that's the interpretation I've always stuck with), maybe they're about drug-addiction, or maybe they really are only about climbing a crystal mountain and finding a ride to the end of the ocean.  However you choose to hear them, they're both wonderfully evocative and relaxing to hear, and as fresh on the 500th listen as on the first.  Other standouts include \"Silver Birch and Weeping Willow,\" about finding comfort in your own company when you can't count on others (or is it really just about watching a sunset?  You decide!); \"There's Got to Be More,\" about ending a stagnant relationship; \"Streets of London,\" a not-at-all-preachy look at homelessness; and \"Water, Paper and Clay,\" a classic folk-singalong whose meaning is anyone's guess.  That said, there isn't a single wasted note on the album, and you could call them all standouts.I could go on for pages, but suffice to say:  if you like folk music, folk-rock, singer-songwriters, or any genre that sticks to real instruments and meaningful lyrics, you can't miss with this CD.

(Himself imprisoned on suspicion of murder!) Of course the Beenie Man and Fambo smash I'm Drinking/ Rum & Red Bull blew up all over R&B charts world-wide.Old fashioned styled roots is delivered faithfully by I-Octane (a star to watch), Jah Cure (released from prison on a possession charge), the much loved Richie Spice and the Bobo chanter Anthony B voices over a classic track.Mavado seems to be mellowing out and Serani gives us his usual version of a Jamaican Usher. Established superstar (by Jamrock standards anyway) Shaggy helps Hezron reach for the charts.Mr Cool Ruler, Gregory Isaacs, drops another lover's rock track.

Old style reggae song w/simple beat, simple lyrics with modern content. Isaacs was a giant of Reggae this is a clean simple example of his work. He has much more music to try. [song title] is owned by AOL.Anthony B. (Keith Blair) and Tosh are next with Sleeping In The Rain. Another old style sounding descriptive simple lyrics and backing tune. Song title features throughout the song. Singer doing a little more. Not bad.Green Grass by Jah Cure. Man with a history providing a more intense reggae experience. Vocal rich, strong song suits Jah Cure's persona. Nice song.Track 4 I-Octane with My Life. Cool modern up beat song. Chatty with neat lyrical and musical hooks. Nothing fancy like it.Buju Banton plays Time & Place. Hugely successful reggae singer with more than average amount of notoriety in his life. This song rocks as reggae rocks. Strong song, Marley opening that builds vocal and strolls to the end. Very cool.Come Into My Room by Mavado feat. Stacious. Very cool fusion of reggae and RnB female and male vocal jousting on great track. Sexy and strong.Hezron & Shaggy play Two Places. Great song, both artists singing around, through and with each other. Two styles merge very well on this very nice tune. Like it.Track 8 is Cake Soap by Vybz Kartel. A man with a lot going on including producing this very cool song. Great backing sounds, up beat track. Very nice.Beenie Man & Fambo with I'm Drinking/Rum & Red Bull. Great drinking song chorus is the key. What's not to like.Richie Spice play Yap Yap. One of the Bonner brothers playing neat well structured reggae pop song. Like it a lot.No Games by Serani is next. Genre maybe Dancehall w/reggae in the mix. Straining vocal over neat backing noise. Under 3 minutes, short and sweet. Like it.Last track is Perfect with Hand Cart Bwoy. Great Ska opening and strong roots sound on this rollin' song. Great track.Mostly Reggae some Dancehall (I dunno) free mp3 download from Tad's Record.

{"text": "A long lost treat for Ray and Moodies fans, this 3 CD and 1 DVD set is brilliantly remastered and contains restored artwork packaged in a glossy hinged cardboard box.  Many of us have been waiting years to get this on CD and it's finally here.  The interview is great but Mike's lines are recently recorded but Ray's responses are from the original 1974 vinyl, still great though.  Ray discusses plans to tour the album that never came to fruition.The remaster on this is slightly brighter than the recent Moodies stuff but much wider than the original LPs and 1990 CD releases.  These are by far the best audiophile versions to own. The bass licks that, to me originally sounded dated plucky and cliche are much deeper and broader in attack.  Field seperation overall is much wider and dynamic aswell.  Plays beautifully in 24 BIT and the 5.1 DVD is great, like a 4 channel mixing board coming through your PS3 or DVD player.  Obviously quad sourced with a compressed Mid-Front Speaker channel which I turned off during screening.  Wonderful to hear crisp detailed versions of these songs as last.The singles are also remastered just as well but the mixes seem inferior, seems like the star of these songs (Ray) is singing from the bathroom down the hall.I miss and love Ray dearly.  If you missed out on the previous releases DO NOT MISS THESE!  These are in limited release and sure to shoot up to $400.00 a box on ebay or something.A beatiful release that just can't be missed, I consider myself spoiled here.I also highly recommend all of the remastered versions of the Moody Blues Solo projects from 1975 up to 1995 from Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, John Lodge and the Graeme Edge Band.

{"text": "Okay...I really like the NEW Foreigner with Kelly Hanson, I understand Mick and Lou can not co exist in the band and Mick wants to keep his band legacy going with vibrant players. That said... while I like the new Unplugged or Acoustique record&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Acoustique/dp/B0053FXLU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acoustique</a>&nbsp;as its often fresh takes on old songs this album is stale and a pure BUSINESS PLOY.I purchased the three disc set at Walmart. You get the unplugged CD..this one and a new DVD from Sound Stage that is not the one which has been available and all for 11.99.  The unplugged set is fun although I like the Elvis cover \"thats all Right\" better than the Foreigner classics... the DVD is terrific  but this Cd is a travesty!!What we have is nearly note for note repeats of the original classic Foreigner tracks and why?  The why is so that the band can offer these to movie and TV commercial producers for use in their productions and cut out Atlantic Records who owns the original masters.  Hey..I understand that move but why release it as a commercial recording?  Kelly is NO Lou Gramm but he's good and fun and on their new material I really enjoy him as I do on live stuff like the DVD...but to make brand new digital recordings of Foreigners Greatest Hits as its billed only serves to bring his not being Lou Gramm into sharp and very digital focus and its not good.  This disc needed to be for producers only and not sent out into the public...its where Mick I am afraid crosses the line in his disagreement with Lou and Lou wins...I'm going to see this band in a month...so don't rate me as a \"hater\" I'm not and I really admire Mick...but there is NO reason to make this record except so we all can hear a Foreigner classic in a commercial or movie and say to ourselves....hmmmm it sounds off a bit...but Mick and Phil Carson can make more mula!\n", "val": 0.00011545580491656438}

That's ever apparent on 'I Wanna Know What Love Is', where he sings the line \"you just can't hide\", as \"you dus' can't hide\". Just sounds kind of retarded. The sax solo on 'Urgent' is sorely lacking as well. Where's Mutt Lange when you need him?If you're a casual classic rock fan, this collection will do. If you identify Foreigner with the soul of Lou Gramm, get the major label release 'No End in Sight: The Very Best of Foreigner'.\n", "val": 9.70304972724989e-05}

{"text": "I would be careful with this collection.  The songs themselves were well chosen, representing the big hits of Foreigner.  However, they really did a lousy job in giving you album versions.Most of the songs were either redone or shortened versions.  Hot Blooded, for instance, is only 3:08 here.  On the original album, I have it running 4:30.  The song I Wanna Know What Love Is runs short--it is supposed to be 5:01.  And they do not sound quite right--even where the time is long, it is because it is a new recording.  Better to pay a little more and get a different compilation.Too bad, because Foreigner is an excellent band for those who like rock but not thrash metal.  The 5 albums this was compiled from are all worthy albums, and I would suggest either getting cuts directly off those albums or picking a different greatest hits album.  There is nothing past 1984 on this album--you will not find anything off their 6th album or from Lou Gramm himself (itself not a major flaw because you can only fit so much material on a single disc without charging more).

{"text": "A Souls RideBesides music I love all things physical and this includes bike riding.  Hmmm where's this going.... I ride all the time and it's when I do a lot of my critical and focused listening.  I have really good in-ear headphones that allow me to drift into the music.  No distractions, just my body and brain lost inside motion.  So with that in mind, I did my first listen to Gretchen Menn's entire \"Hale Souls\" album on my evening ride back from a day with the amazing and beautiful Jason Becker.  In short, I love it!!!  Gretchen's playing kicks ass!  And even more impressively for me are her compositional chops.On my journey the album went to a really magical place in the second half.  It just hit me in all the right spots.  Don't get me wrong, the first half of the record is killer; Valentino's Victory Lap in particular sits right in the Satriani wheel house!  But starting with \"Is It Not Strange\" I really got my yummy face on!  It's a combination of her melodic sense, arrangements, time and chord structure and beautiful sensitivity to balance.  At peak moments I found myself drifting to landscapes of Pat Metheny and Jean-luc Ponty.Let's look at each of the second-half tracks specifically...\"Is It Not Strange\"Beautiful counterpoint, and arrangement work.  I Love, love, love, Gretchen's classical GT playing and beautifully crafted voicing.  There is so much subtlety and tasty balance going on in this track.\"Captured Barricade\"Fantastic in terms of showing off her full palette.  I'm sure her stupid-good!!! rhythm section (Stu Hamm and John Mader) had some good notes for this one!  Wonderful harmonic structure and yummy flowy melodies.  The main descending lead line starting at 1:06 is just great!\"Walking Shadow\"I LOVE that Gretchen made this choice on this record!... And the Violin playing ain't bad (Ha!).  Specifically, this beautifully realized solo violin piece gives us a real chance to feel Gretchen's cultured and truly touching compositional heartbeat.  \"Walking Shadow\" works with much of the same emotional substance as \"Higher\" does on Jason Becker's \"Perspective\" album.  As much as I love guitar (and trust me there are very few people that love it more than me) I am usually disappointed in Guitar records.  Guitar players too often define themselves by their guitar playing.  Guitar players, like all musicians, should be musicians and hopefully artists first and guitar players second.  It's clear to me that Gretchen understands this critical distinction.  The guitar is her main voice and she uses it beautifully BUT it's not her only voice.  For this she has my true respect!\"Struck Sleepless\"Come on! ... the opening dissonant chords...  I crave me some dissonance (Stravinsky) ... Then the very smooth transition to the main melody.  Complex transitions are very hard to pull off and not sound \"clever\"... And the use of the violin doubling is great!  This track has some real Metheny in it.\"Fading\"An album... From start to finish should do just that... Finish.  My favorites finishes are those that lead you down and into dreamland; a place for your mind to reflect on the path just traveled.  \"Fading\" does just that and is strikingly beautiful.--Overall--It's clear to me that Gretchen's influences and interests are vast; AC/DC to her sister's haunting voice in Fading.  That's right after my own heart!  Her tastes are moody, aggressive, complex, playful and most of all creative.An album when it's right is a portrait of the artist at a point in their life.  With \"Hale Souls\" Gretchen Menn has painted a wonderful canvas.-Mike Bemesderfer\n", "val": 0.0446152426302433}
{"text": "As a musician and a guitar player first and foremost, I am often seeking new music and artists such as Gretchen Menn, for inspiration! \"Hale Souls\" is an amazing compilation of guitar mastery with its ecclectic blend of songs and wide range of styles. Tunes like \"Scrap Metal\" and \"Oleo Strut\" are just dripping with attitude and absolutely dazzles the listener with Gretchen's fleet fretted passages! Then you have \"Deja Vu\" providing plenty of smooth, soul soothing tone. Meanwhile, other songs such as \"Fast Crowd\".. \"Its Not Strange\".. and \"Fading\" for example, contain plenty of acoustic and classical brilliance!To sum it up, Gretchen Menn is an accomplished guitar player that has mastered many musical styles. Most importantly, she creates songs that are tastefully performed while paying careful attention to their arrangement. Without fail, \"Hale Souls\" will most certainly impress and entertain the most discerning of musical palates as Gretchen Menn continues to be an inspirational musician who is highly regarded as \"a guitar player's, player\"!\n", "val": 0.05150283873081207}
{"text": "I really, really like \"Hale Souls,\" and the more I've listened to it, the more it's grown on me. Snippets on iTunes don't do full justice in exposing you to just how interesting it is, especially considering the way the songs are constructed to unfold, so I suggest taking the plunge and getting the whole CD, or at least buying full tracks.It would be easy to start barking up the wrong tree, if you only hear a few seconds of the first track, \"Scrap Metal.\" It could easily fool you into thinking that this entire CD is going to smack you relentlessly with a big wall of overdriven guitar over driving bass and pounding drums. However, in those first few seconds, Gretchen Menn has merely lured you into what turns out to be a showcase of some very clever melodies (and catchy, at that). \"Oleo Strut\" and \"Valentino's Victory Lap\" also mix that hard edge with her compelling melodic and rhythmic structures that pop with some very tricky technique, showcasing finesse that keeps unfolding as the CD progresses.This collection of songs boasts some fine musicianship from not only Menn, but others. Bassist extraordinaire Stu Hamm contributes not only spellbinding solos, but very solid support throughout most of the tracks (the solo on \"Deja Vu\" is especially beautiful). Jude Gold lends fun, intricate second acoustic guitar on \"Fast Crowd,\" perfectly complementing Menn's composition as well as her deft picking. If this song doesn't bring a smile to your face, I'm not sure what would. Following that is an all-Gretchen Menn multiple guitar piece, \"Is It Not Strange,\" where she provides her own captivating counterpoint and interwoven melodies.Maybe the most striking thing about the CD (at least, to me) is that from the first track through the tenth (final) track, the music spans a broad range not only from song to song but within the songs, juxtaposing beautiful legato melodies with solid, well-credentialed rock grooves, all the while opening up new surprises (both guitaristically and compositionally) with each song.The last several minutes leave a strong impression that seems so different from the one you might have developed in the first several minutes, attributable to Gretchen Menn's excellent choice not only of the compositions, but the order in which they're presented. Here's a good example: The sweetness of the solo violin piece, \"Walking Shadow,\" leads you seamlessly right into the powerful, angular \"Struck Sleepless,\" which puts some scorching guitar front and center along with the violin. Ending with the beautiful, haunting \"Fading,\" which blends quick multiple guitars, violin, and the ethereal soprano singing of Gretchen's sister Kirsten.While Gretchen Menn is a fine guitarist, this collection shows she's also a sophisticated composer, able to plumb the depths of many genres and to craft memorable, fun, interesting music that doesn't just showcase the \"shredder\" guitarslinger, but instead moves you with the music itself.\n", "val": 0.029021969065070152}

Rarely, these days, is a rock musician willing to put themselves out there, with no one else to lean on, and say, \"Here's what I can do,\" and also pull it off in the performance.  It's brave, and if you'll allow me the analogy, right up there with the Yo-Yo Ma's of the world, alone on the stage with only his cello.  Alone is alone, no matter who you are.  This album gives the listener a wide range of pieces, so there is something there for everyone to get excited about.  Of the ten songs on the album there are at least five that I will play to death.

{"text": "Wow!!! This is the first instrumental guitar album I've purchased in ages. Not because I'm \"not a guitar nut\"--I is!!! But, even to this day, so many guitar players dip their feet into \"neo-Classical\" land, get stuck there, and you end up with even more records with endless arpeggios, scalar \"melodies\" (*cough*), and \"exercises\" outlining rehashed baroque changes... Four-minute songs with three-minute guitar solos. BORING!Well, I'm happy to say that GRETCHEN MENN'S debut solo disc, HALE SOULS, is the POLAR opposite of the generic instrumental records I just ragged upon. There's not a two-octave, neck pickup, sweep arpeggio to be found. No cheeseball \"3rds\" harmonizing... In fact, Gretchen's biggest influence appears to be STEVE MORSE--one of the most versatile pickers on the planet, and in my opinion, one of the most innovative \"guitar music\" composers, ever. GRETCHEN's music on HALE SOULS is actually a total breath of fresh air, to me. There are actual SONGS, with great parts, tones, grooves (the bouncy feel of \"Oleo Strut\"), chord and meter changes (check out \"Dja Vu\"), slamming energy (the hip, pounding metal of \"Scrap Metal\" and \"Captured Barricade\") and varied instrumentation (dueling acoustic guitars--with JUDE GOLD--on the KILLER \"Fast Crowd,\" strings on \"Walking Shadow,\" the clean electric/acoustic guitar splendor of the FRESH, Baroque-ish \"Is It Not Strange,\" and other touches on certain songs). But a lot of it is slam-bam, tasty \"power trio\" material--again, not unlike the Steve Morse Band. This is a great, diverse debut disc!!!! You MUST earball!!Gretchen may not have the \"soloing\" chops of modern greats like Guthrie or Greg Howe, Bumblefooot, or Buckethead. But she's got killer compositional chops, and can whip through technically challenging (but MEMORABLE) \"guitar jock\" melody lines. Her great playing CERTAINLY elevates her stellar guitar pieces even further. Spark up your guitar music collection with this disc, NOW! You'll be glad you did :-)\n", "val": 0.006964569911360741}

{"text": "With Miranda Lambert having developed a reputation as \"a bit of a rocker chick,\" her new trio with Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley provides an opportunity to indulge more of her East Texas country roots. The trio harmonizes in tight, veering lines that recall the Andrews Sisters, and trade opportunities to write and sing lead. Signed to Columbia, the production has Nashville production quality, but the backings include steel and acoustic guitar, and only occasionally venture into the contemporary country mold. The trio sings gritty songs of outlaw women leading rough lives of marital discord, family dysfunction, economic drought and bad habits. The latter hits a peak with the excess libations of the superbly not-ready-for-modern-country-radio \"Takin' Pills.\" Lambert can't help but shine, but she's clearly settled into the group vibe, sharing the spotlight with her friends and making this a balanced showcase of all three Annies' pistol-sharp singing and songwriting talent.

If you like her solo work, then you'll find you like the Pistol Annies too. The songs have that same general \"I'm a strong independent woman who does what I feel like and I don't consider consequences\" theme.The lyrics are butt kicking. The sound is awesome. It's just good music.It's true country music. Not the junk you find on modern country radio. Lemon Drop (Track 2)  sounds like it was written in 1962, and that's not a bad thing. Bad Example (Track 4) has that same old timey sound but modern lyrics. Fun lyrics!!!There are some slow sweat songs. There are some fast fun songs. There's a little bit of everything.\n", "val": 0.029709914699196815}

{"text": "I remember when Thomas Whitfield left this world for heaven ... more recently, Walter Hawkins ... I thought, God, who's left to give us prolific inspiration and direction in spiritual song? The resounding answer is ... Donald Lawrence! I'm more than sure there are scores of good writers/musicians/singers, and time simply will not allow me to list them. However I want to single out a man who clearly displays genius in his gift to musically lead this generation of believers. His uniqueness in combining the \"right\" vocalist with the some of the most profound lyrical content (not to mention the slammin-est band!) ... is unparalleled! He even reached back and brought us the wonderful talent of Kim MacFarland. (Missed you Kim.) Anyone having experienced Donald's gift need not concern themselves with the completeness of this latest project. He has taken composition to an entirely new and exciting level! I still miss Thomas ... and Walter ... but they have obviously left their respective marks on this great man. When I think to highlight one particular cut on this latest CD, I realize that to single any one song out would do the complilation an injustice. It's masterfully done (as only Donald can do). Suffice it to say, it will not disappoint. I promise you! Donald Lawrence & Company has done it again ... It was well worth the wait.

And this really helped Ashley Monroe's career also.I don't think there is a bad song on this cd.  The title song Hell On Heels, Lemon Drops, Bad Example,Takin' Pills are all highlights.

{"text": "When it comes to songwriting, The Curmudgeon holds few, if any, in higher regard than Burt Bacharach and Hal David. A collection of their work is like listening to the history of pop music itself, with lyrics, melodies and choruses so ingrained in your consciousness it's impossible to tell why you know them, you just KNOW them. Close to You, I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself, Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head, I Say a Little Prayer For You, Make it Easy on Yourself, Walk on By.. amazing song after amazing song, the list goes on. Some songs are bigger than the artists themselves. All of Bacharach and David's are. It's not just pop hooks they expertly crafted, these songs often tell stories, with unique, genius wordplay (think of Do You Know the Way to San Jose, or What's New Pussycat, to name just two). Modern day \"song\" writers, going on and on about the exact same things (how many songs are about being in a club now?) should hang their heads in shame.So, then, when it comes to joining with Bacharach himself and re-creating these classic songs, who better than.. Ronan Keating? Ooooh, I dunno... just about anybody?See, when it comes to creating the quintessential pop song, Burt is the man. But when it comes to choosing talent to sing those songs nowadays, Burt clearly needs another man to do it. Remember, this is the guy who sat happily watching defunct British girl-band All Saints chew their way through \"There's Always Something There to Remind Me\" (you'd think that alone would have given Burt something to remind him - to never try this sort of thing again). So we now have to sit through boyband berk and charisma vacuum, Ronan Keating, a guy who would be more suited to singing along with Bert and Ernie, ruin 10 classic songs for absolutely no reason.Yeah, OK, Ronan's got a nice enough voice for his own tedious blend of undemanding, MOR pop mush, but no WAY does he have the vocal range to tackle something like \"Make it Easy on Yourself\", and he does what no-one should do when covering a BB song; he makes them boring. Flat, uninspired, like the sort of thing you'd hear at the \"entertainment\" nights of some horrible hotel for the nearly-dead.Covers albums are often the last refuge of the artistically bankrupt (see Phil Collin's recent, shameful rape of Motown, itself a sure-fire future inductee into Amazon Room 101), and Ronan is, of course, no stranger to this. Having built a career out of singing other people's material (his last THREE albums before this consisted entirely of famous hits), it's not like his songwriting well has run dry, but any interest in his own solo career clearly has. Basically, if Ronan isn't back with fellow pop numbskulls Boyzone or singing songs that are already famous, the public simply don't want to know.The really galling thing about this album is the sheer pointlessness of it all. There are already fantastic hit collection packages of Burt Bacharach, from slimline \"Definitive\" collections to lavish boxsets documenting and celebrating the songs of Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Hell, one simple browse through iTunes or Amazon and you can have your own Hits collection, sung by the likes of Tom Jones, Dionne Warwick and the Carpenters. The name \"Ronan Keating\" just cannot be mentioned alongside those names, unless it's \"Ronan Keating is not fit to scoop up the excrement of..\"So people shouldn't live in the past. I get that. So if we really must have a modern interpretation of Baccarach/David songs, why make them sound as devoid of passion as this? And why rope in Ronan Keating, not only a guy who doesn't have the vocal chops to do these songs justice in the first place, but also an artist who ceased to be even approaching relevant 10 years ago? There is no justification for this record to exist.So what happened when Ronan Met Burt? A fading popstar was immediately out of his depth, singing songs he doesn't even deserve to have on his iPod, and the world as we know it just grew a little darker.\n", "val": 0.0002094791707349941}

Am I being cynical? Maybe, but I enjoy her solo music even though I question its classification as country, whereas I have no hesitation in classifying the music of the Pistol Annies as country.Some of the songs are amusing including Trailer fir rent, which has some mild expletives in the lyrics. I generally prefer songwriters to avoid expletives of any kind, but they work well here.This whole album is great from the opening Hell on heels to the closing Family feud.\n", "val": 0.01327233575284481}

{"text": "I've kind of got mixed feelings about the Pistol Annies' powerhouse debut, HELL ON HEELS. Yes, this is an incredibly strong release, full of killer harmonies, smart songs and lively arrangements.  However, I can't help but feel that the disc also cribbed a lot of it's best material away from co-founder Miranda Lambert's latest solo effort FOUR THE RECORD, resulting in her weakest release to date. As much as I love the Annies, this is something I do NOT want to see happen again.  But let's start off by talking about those harmonies! While Lambert is definitely the heart and soul of both the group and the disc, co-founders Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley more than hold their own. (Monroe, in particular, is a revelation, often sounding like a young Dolly).  Things kick off (no pun intended!) with the sultry title track. This tale of female empowerment (and maybe just a LITTLE bit of gold digging!) has it all...a hypnotic arrangement, sharp lyrics (\"I done made the devil a deal/He made me pretty/He made me smart/And I'm gonna break me a million hearts\"), tons of attitude. But it's the vocals that really shine...each lady stands out, but they also manage to blend beautifully together. A nice way to get things going.  Presley takes center stage on \"Lemon Drop.\" There's a whistful quality to both the song and her vocal that both tugs at your heartstrings AND has you rooting for her, all at the same time. Toss in little extras like Lambert's whistle, the sweet lyrics (\"My life is like a lemon drop/I'm sucking on the bitter to get to the sweet part\") and the closing \"Thaaaank God!\", and you have a track that's an absolute joy!  The same can be said about \"Beige\", one of my absolute favorite cuts off of HOH. There's no denying that there's a forlorn quality to the song, but in it's saddness comes a stunning beauty. There's just such a real, honest, organic vibe going on....I don't know if the track is powerful in it's simplicity or simple in it's power, but it works....boiy, does it work! And Monroe's lead vocal? WOW!!!  \"Bad Example\" is fun enough, what with it's toe-tapping groove and wink-and-a-nudge lyrics, but the girls will have to be careful in the future....Lambert has danced across this musical floor often enough in the past...they don't want to tread the same territory too frequently. Still, a fun little stomp!  I'm not a big fan of \"The Housewife's Prayer\"....I'm sure there are some women ~ and men! ~ who feel this way (\"I've been thinking about all these pills I'm taking/I wash them down with an ice cold beer/And the love I ain't been making\"), but what about all of those women who didn't? Women (like my Mom) who soldiered on, knowing this is what they wanted, knowing this is what they signed on for,  knowing there would be ups and downs. I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into the song, but there's just something....disrespectful....about the track for me. (The downbeat arrangement doesn't help any either!). By far, my least favorite track off of the disc.  \"Takin' Pills\" is a total country rave-up...with it's energetic arrangement and spirited vocals, this is often what's called \"good time music.\" But it's the lyrics that really bring it on home....lines like \"She's got a Tennessee mountain point of view/If you're gonna have one, might as well have two\" and \"No filter on her mouth or her cigarette\" just pop! Love, love, LOVE this song! One of HELL ON HEELS' best moments!  There's nothing terribly profound about \"Boys From The South\"....back in the 60's and 70's, this would have been considered a nice \"album track.\"  The arrangement and instrumentation is relaxed and evenly paced ~ sort of like a Summer night on the back porch ~ while Lambert's lead vocal is dreamy, coy and assured, all at the same time. Yep, nothing special, but a nice little album track!  The same can be said about \"The Hunter's Wife\"....is it deep? No. Is it songwriting at it's best? No. Is it fun? Without a doubt! Presley's lively vocal skates over the animated lyrics, resulting in an almost giddy groove. Proof positive that sometimes \"fun\" is much more important than \"profound!\"  \"Trailer For Rent\" is classic Lambert (if there can be such a thing after less than ten years in the business!)....the cut could have easily fit on any of her solo discs (particularly KEROSENE).Great instrumentation, great vocal, great lyrics..it's got it all! But the song's TRUE power lies in it's overall vibe...that feeling you get of wanting to be on this gal's side, to really have her back....or be sad for her....or help her torch the place! In other words, it touches you...and that's all you can expect music to do. VERY nice.  Things wrap up with another favorite of mine, the stinging \"Family Feud.\" Poppy and peppy on the surface, you don't have to dig down too deep to hit the anger, frustration and resentment. Each of the ladies once again shine on their respective lead vocals on the verses, coming together in pitch perfect harmony for the choruses. Another stellar moment!  And I can't help but believe that there are plenty more of those moments to come. Much like the members of, say, Fleetwood Mac, each of the members of the Pistol Annies is an amazing artist in her own right who just gets better when combined with the other members, resulting in something magical. Here's hoping that that magic doesn't take away from their individual solo careers, but that it does result in more moments like HELL ON HEELS! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).\n", "val": 0.017939915880560875}

{"text": "I had heard about this all-girls country super-star band, which includes country superstar Miranda Lambert, along with Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley, but I hadn't heard a single song, until now. I'm not particulary a country music fan to be honest, but I am a fan of great music, whatever the genre. The other day I was browsing my local library and curiosity got the better of me and I picked this up. Boy, am I glad I did!\"Hell on Heels\" (10 tracks; 30 min.) starts off with the title track, and the best track on here. The song is a delicious musical mash-up of country and sliding guitars reverb, and not to mention the choice lyrics (\"I'm gonna break me a million hearts/I'm hell on heels/Sugar daddy, I'm coming for you\"). After that, the album's musical vibe is more country-traditional, and that's fine, as it all sounds smooth and I really enjoy as the songs roll along. Several other outstanding tracks for me include \"Boys From the South\" and \"Trailer for Rent\" (with this rip: \"It's been ten years, ten thousand beers/And he's still sittin right there on the couch\" OUCH!).At 30 min., this album flies by in no time, and you'll play this again and again. This album is nothing short of a pleasant surpise to me. Would love to see these ladies live in concert at some point. Meanwhile, \"Hell on Heels\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n", "val": 0.031861912459135056}

However, the focal point of the songs clearly is the vocals, which are great, especially when the Annies are harmonizing or alternating the lead.  While the structure of the songs definitely is traditional, the attitude expressed in the lyrics definitely is brash and contemporary.  Not surprisingly, all of the songs come from a young woman's perspective, and they tell tales of women feeling sad, getting mad, or being bad.  Very enjoyable.

I'll caveat this review with my prejudice: I think Miranda Lambert is arguably the greatest overall talent to ever hit Nashville. This album really is classic Miranda, sassy, sweet, smartass white trash, and always on target. The addition of Angaleena and Ashley adds impressive dimension, and their contributions in writing and vocals are substantial. This is hardcore country, from writing to instrumentals. There's not a weak song on the album; in a fair world they're all hits, but I guess a few radio station program managers might need to grow up, get real, lose some piety and develop a sense of humor for that to happen. This album is the kind of stuff that made country music great, its ground zero and real with old time rural irony, all traits most modern country music is sadly lacking. Every song blew me away. Ok, I'm starting to ramble, but because I really want to say I like the Pistol Annies even more than Miranda by herself, and that would be blasphomy.\n", "val": 0.008974839001893997}

{"text": "The album starts off strong with the lead single \"Hell On Heels\" which shows that these gals are not the typical pop divas that's currently being played on country radio. The music from the first single is both haunting, sassy, and very country as the women sings how their looks and brains will break a million hearts as they used men to get what they want. The next single is \"Lemon Drop\" which is simple and delightful. \"Beige\" is slow, but the twang of the lead vocalist is what makes this song special. \"Bad Example\" continues where \"Hell On Heels\" left off by showing these gals as some 'bad chicks' (in a good way). \"Housewife's Prayers\" is so smooth and sad because you know millions of women can identify with being neglected in their marriages and drowning in despair in their homes. \"Takin Pills' is funny but it leads alot to be desired. I wished they had developed that song more. \"Boys From The South\" is a great tribute to southern men and I have a feeling this will be a hit record if every released. \"The Hunter's Wife\" is wild to me bcause when was the last time you heard a country song sing about eating coon's stew? \"Trailer for Rent\" might be the most daring song because its almost as if they are singing about putting themselves for rent---to another man that is not their husband. The last song is \"Family Feud\" which is a page from my own family experiences. I especially love the last line \"The good Lord give it and the family take it away\".For those who enjoy the safe, predictiable, and boring pop songs that's being played on today's country radio, this album is not for you. But for those who are missing real country done in a modern day style, with a twist of dare and spunk done by real southern divas, then this album is for you.

Their hooks are catchy, their harmonies and melodies are phenomenal, and the chemistry between them is perfect. This is definitely worth a listen!\n", "val": 0.04773588851094246}
{"text": "A lot.  I've always been a huge fan of Miranda's and never understood how she got such little respect and was passed over for the airbrushed Nashville studio voices who have brokers working deals buying songs for them and producers analyzing how best to market them; studio puppets!Now I know, Miranda said to hell with that, and did her own thing writing and singing making her own way.  And now she's turned some heads and I'm sure broken some hearts.I wasn't expecting much from this album and honestly thought, ug, really?  I've been wrong before and I'll be wrong again and I was wrong this time!  It's soulful old school without the cheese.  The 3 of these ladies complement each other so well which isn't easy to do.I'm proud to be a fellow Texan of great talent of this scale, and we've got talent!!\n", "val": 0.009127485565841198}

I am so grateful for his new song and upcoming album. I do believe that this song will encourage major growth in the Christian faith. I know that many Christians may at times feel that their past sins or even present sins define them but this song reminds believers that there is no need to go back to their life before Christ because Jesus paid it all with his life. So walk in that Repent and turn away from what we used to do. This song is awesome and I encourage everyone to give it a try I may be a blessing to you.\n", "val": 0.03341234102845192}

His technical competence is as good or better than anyone I have ever heard and his inventiveness with melody is great as well.This CD is very heavy, more like speed or thrash than some of his other efforts. \"In The Wake Of Chaos\" had much more of a joe Satriani vibe and sound, but this is a lot heavier. At times the drums almost overwhelm the guitar, but that is part of the sound and the brilliance of the guitar playing still shines through.I highly recommend this to all fans of instrumental guitar rock and I would recommend it above the Jeff Loomis solo disk.\n", "val": 0.04420969635248184}
{"text": "Andy James is the kind of guitarist most metal players wish they could be...this guy is simply excellent. However, unless you're well aquainted with the underground metal scene in the U.K. you've likely not heard of him. He does a bunch of stuff on Youtube with Lick Library, teaching the licks and tricks of just about every metal god out there from Vai to Satriani to Gilbert, etc...and he does this all very well. James plays with a relatively unknown group called Sacred Mother Tongue as well, but it is his solo work that truly astounds. James is a beast on the guitar. Have you heard Jeff Loomis' solo album? This guy is easily as good, maybe even better. I'm a loomis fan, but the new self titled Andy James album is even more listenable. His last album was essentially a home recorded effort with backup from small time grooveyard records. This one is top-notch production quality with a well known grindcore producer. Andy James' star is on the rise with this effort as well as new endorsements with ESP guitars and Blackstar Amps. Highly recommended!!\n", "val": 0.03505031391978264}

{"text": "This is Andy's second solo release and the music is a combination of metal, thrash metal and progressive metal.  It's an all instrumental effort, but it never gets old and its an easy listen which is unusual for an instrumental release.  Through all tracks there is an effort to pull the listener in and this effort works very well.  Days after my last listen i still have the melodies in my head.  Rarely can an artist with the type of technical skills Andy has harness the desire to solo all over the place just to show off chops.  Andy does lay down some of the most blistering solo guitar work i've ever heard here for sure, but the soloing always seems to make the music better...  Many are likely familiar with the work of Jeff Loomis and or Chris Broderick, these two guitarist are at the top of the food chain amongst modern metal shredders.  Andy's skills are right there with these two players but it is Andy's song writing skills and soulful playing that makes this release far better in my opinion than anything the two guys have put out.  Give this cd a spin - you will not be disappointed, top notch playing, song writing, etc...\n", "val": 0.01748662441968918}

{"text": "This review is specific to the Japanese 10 track CD (or mini-LP, as it's advertised), not the original vinyl release that came out in 1983.  All though it looks VERY professional, there's no way this is an official release.  The most obvious clue being tracks 4 and 5, which are only available on vinyl legitimately, (Son of Star Fleet is the B-side to the 45 RPM edited single and the Ford Advert came from a 12\" vinyl single of Brian May's \"Driven By You\" off his first solo album, Back To The Light), and on this CD you can CLEARLY hear the pops of a vinyl record on those two tracks.  It doesn't sound like anything was done to improve the sound of them.These two are the only tracks that appear to be sourced from records.  The first 3 songs are exact digital copies of the first CD versions of Star Fleet, which were originally extra tracks on the 2-part CD singles for the song, \"Back To The Light\".  Tracks 6-8 were also released on other CD singles from the same album.  Tracks 9 and 10 were new to me, which is why I bought this disc.  I don't know their origin.  \"Ride To Win\" is an excellent instrumental version of \"Resurrection\" from Back To The Light, and \"Somewhere In Time\" is a slightly different mix of track 7, (Nothin' But Blue - Guitar version), but with the drums much more in front in the mix.What's amazing about this disc is the packaging.  It's done VERY well.  It's basically a recreation of the original vinyl EP.  (I uploaded some customer images so you can see for yourself.)  It has all the liner notes from the original release, and even the explanation about what an EP is and how that helps make the vinyl version sound better!I'm giving it 4 stars based on the fact that these tracks are not easily available digitally anymore, so if you're looking for an actual physical product as a souvenir for this release, rather than a download, you'll be very happy with this disc.  But if you want a legitimate copy of Star Fleet, you have to hunt down either the 2-part CD singles from \"Back To The Light\" or the original vinyl EP.\n", "val": 0.00026515143690630794}

A random conversation reminded me of it, and as with lost friends, the internet proved a valuable tool in finally tracking it down. I would have been happy with the original E.P. \"Blues Breaker (dedicated to E.C.)\" is worth the price of the album, as any time you can get two guitarists the level of Brian May and Edward Van Halen playing blues together is almost historical, but this extended album is better yet with compositions credited to May, Jimmy Page and the late Cozy Powell.

One of the great 'lost' guitar solos of Eddie Van Halen appears here, with May's wailing Red Special a wonderful counterpoint.The bluesy companion pieces feature more dueling guitars, and provide a handy reminder of what Queen would've sounded like if they'd done more of this kind of stuff (See What A Fool I've Been and Soul Brother are rare examples).The disc also features a poorly-transferred (this def seems like it's from vinyl) shorter instrumental version of 'Starfleet', versions of 'Driven By You', and other later May tracks.\n", "val": 0.0001254692324437201}

With constant melodies submerged in raw basslines in tracks like \"Plugged In,\" \"Boomerang,\" and \"Above and Beyond,\" this album delivers with nothing but awesome. Norin also comes back to some old roots, instigating some breakbeat nostalgia with tracks like \"Disintegration Part IV\" and \"After Thought.\" Besides the heavy pounding melodies with numerous tracks, he also shines through with an older track \"Lights\" (a remix of Ellie Goulding's hit single) and it's damn near perfection. This track brings back a short-lived memory of a bootleg he made back in 2009, being the remix of Nelly Furtado's Magical World.

Also, in a funny aside, I was playing it softly while I had my 70+ year old mom in the car and there were air raid sirens as part of the mix which got her blood pressure up while trying to figure out \"what that awful noise\" was. Hilarious! I'm middle aged and still terrorizing my parents with my music.

This album isn't quite to focused on just heavy bass hits as it is with a unique sound. You won't find much in the way of extreme synthesizer effects and loud crashing, jarring noises. Some of his albums make want to get up and run around, but Divergent Spectrum always puts on a smooth flow with a stead beat that I always find myself nodding my head to, even if I'm studying.

His remix of Ellie Goulding's \"Lights\" is another highlight, albeit of the more chill variety. \"The Matrix\" is another personal fave. Clocking in at 15 tracks, you'd think this album would drag at the end, but Bassnectar keeps it tight the whole way though.

I wish I would have just downloaded a few choice tracks because this thing is nothing special. The greatest songs on here are his remixes of Ellie Gouldings \"Lights\", the rest are forgettable bores, he seems to rely too much on the big hitting dub step bass instead of real artistic merit.Though they do have some nice beats, they just all sound the same. To me, I can't stand when an artist doesn't mix it up and gives his/her album variety.On another note, the artist himself is a bit of of toolbag. I \"like\" him on facebook and he's begun to share his dumb political views. He posted a poll stating people who watch Fox News are \"ignorant\" and are less intelligent than people who watch regular news. Conviently the poll was done by some hippie little college in New York and he's posting that nonsense like it was gospel. Now I'm sure many of you will say \"HE'S AN ARTIST AND ENTITLED TOHIS OPINION LOOOLZZ\". That's great, but so am I. I just want to hear your music and not your political opinion. I wouldnt care if he was posting something about CNN, MSBNC views or liberals. I don't want to hear it. People backlashed against him and he literally cursed out anyone who disagreed with HIS view, even though it was some political hate speech.So - take this review how you will, should you buy the album? No, the music doesn't quite measure up to the last, and the artist himself is a douche. But give the tracks a listen and decide for yourself.\n", "val": 3.188184928148985e-05}
{"text": "The electronic nomad Ashton Lorin, better known as Bassnectar, has succeeded at creating an eclectic and diverse album that within minutes has you unintentionally bobbing your head in appreciation. His album Divergent Spectrum, released on August 2nd, 2011 through his label Amorphous Music, provides us with something more than just your typical dubstep album. Bassnectar's most recent album explores all facets of electronic music mixed with hard-hitting dubstep beats. Bassnectar, a California based DJ and producer, is famous for his electronic mixes and combining mainstream music with intense bass lines and the popular \"wobble\" bass used by a variety of dubstep musicians. For those not familiar with the dubstep genre, it is a type of electronic dance music that originated in London, England.  Dubstep music is most associated with prodigious bass lines, reverberant drum patterns and clipped samples and is often, but not always combined with vocals. A common characteristic of dubstep is the wobble bass, which makes quite a few appearances in the Divergent Spectrum album. It can be described as an extended bass note that is manipulated rhythmically and is typically produced by using a low frequency oscillator (an electronic signal that creates rhythmic pulses or sweep that are used to modulate synthesizers) to manipulate various parameters of a synthesizer (including volume, distortion and filter cutoff). However, Bassnectar is not solely a dubstep musician. His songs, especially in this album, present his use of various techniques of composition, whether it is a shift in meter and timings or enveloping a unique multiplicity of layers of synthesized harmonies, rappers and singers. Another interesting factor of his music is his use of various tempos that ensures the captivity of his listeners. He uses a wide-ranging scale of speeds to create what he calls \"omni-tempo maximalism\", meaning that all speeds, time signatures and rhythms are possible and in-turn creating a mixture of every sound you've ever heard. Surprisingly enough, this does not cause his tracks to sound overwhelming and instead flourishes the listeners' motivation to listen to every song in the album. The first album in the track, \"Upside Down\",  is a typical dub track with attractive bass lines and is most reminiscent of the more popular mainstream dub music we find playing in clubs and on the radio. This was a great track to start off the album for it is full of sirens, robotic and pitched down vocals and an overall appealing mix of sounds that would especially interest fans of heavy dubstep music. Other tracks like \"The Matrix\", \"Red Step\" and \"Heads up\" are also upbeat songs on the album that would fit well in a dance party playlist.The album also includes less upbeat tracks like \"Boomerang\", which with its synth-like melodies is much more ominous with lots of bass and wobble.  The song \"Afterthought\" is also a much more relaxed electronica track with ambient tones mixed with calm clapping beats.  The album also includes three remixes, \" Plugged in\", \"Immigraniada\" (Gorgol Bordello) and \"Lights\" (Ellie Goulding), which all present segments of the original songs mixed with pieces of heavy dubstep and wobbly bass lines characteristic of Bassnectar's pieces.Overall, the album presents a variety of songs that are not all similar in nature and are not all typically dubstep and electronic. There are, however, pieces in the album that do not add much to the mix. An example of this is the song \"Above and Beyond\" which felt more like white noise serving as filler track for the album. Divergent Spectrum, which within the first 10 hours of being released reached number 6 on iTunes Top 10 for album sales, lives up to its hype. It offers a collection of tracks that are representative of the signature trendy, bass-exploding, head-lolling hits that put Bassnectar on the map but also includes necessary low-key tracks to balance out the mix. The Best part of the album is that it successfully incorporates Bassnectar's take on many genres including anthem rock, heavy dubstep, and hip-hop, ensuring that listeners will, at the very least,  find one song on the album that they will instantly be adding to their iTunes library.\n", "val": 0.01705293357372284}

Production is usually a problem on these albums but the learning curve to a better sound may or may not happen. These artists need more seasoning. The fact that everyone has the ability to record music and publish it, is not any kind of indicator for what kind success or lack of success that a musical person will have. Most of this music is not mellow, it's amateurish and I don't mean that in a refreshing garage band sort of way.

She raps and sings, and does both in her own laid back style. If you plan on dancing, this is the album for you. The production is stellar.

It's a mix of dance, hip hop, rock, jazz, and classical music. I really love music that is a fusion of different genres so this is definitely an appealing album to me.She has a really sexy voice and it meshes well with her beats that consist of deep bass, strings, and a host of other electronically modified instruments. Some of her tracks sound like they have an international influence, particularly Latin and French.Favorites of mine include \"In My Trunk,\" \"Me,\" \"Breathe,\" \"In The Dark,\" and \"Bass Down Low.\"Maybe not for everyone, but I definitely dig it.\n", "val": 0.04657571017742157}

I am not the type of person that purchases CDs because I usually listen to them a few times then just put them in the basket and never touch them again but with Dev that's never gonna happen. No matter how many times I listen to this CD and all the tracks it never gets old! The tracks are solid and catchy which is what I like in music! I hope Dev's next album will be as good as this one is! Some people say that her music is all one genre but every song on this album has something different to it although it may not seem like there is! This album is definitely worth the money and I would recommend this to any one who enjoys partying and having music to dance to! 5/5 for me!\n", "val": 0.03391142934560776}

There are a lot of bands/singers that I like to \"keep\" as mine, but Dev and this album needs to reach as many ears as possible.  I am excited to see what she comes up with in the future.  The only downside to this album (in my opinion) reflect the typical Cataracs stuff - not bad, but I wanted more of Dev than I wanted Cataracs.  Regardless, each song is gold and I am content listening to this album on repeat for a long while.  I'll be sure to let my friends know about this album!  Great album Dev!\n", "val": 0.007841510698199272}

{"text": "I like to think the title says it all but I will explain. Artists release albums, a collection of their songs, for public consumption. In an album, there are a few singles that are enjoyable to listen to and distinct. The rest of the songs seem filler, after listening a while they all blend together. Albums are not cheap compared to singles. Because there are some songs in an album I'll probably delete after I buy it, I choose not to pay for those songs, buying just the songs I like instead.The closest I have come to buying a complete album was with Katy Perry's Teenage Dream. In that album, I liked most of the songs except for Circle the Drain, which I hated. With Dev's The Night The Sun Came Up, I enjoyed every song so I bought the entire album. It marks a first for me.It is hard to choose a favorite song because they are all exceptional. But if I had to make a decision, I would go with Kiss My Lips because the hook is amazing.I have listened to each song in the album at least 50 times and each song is still fresh.

{"text": "I like the way amazon has been putting these classical collections together--they seem fun with a massive amount of money for a couple of dollars. The recordings are high quality and I certainly have nothing bad to say about the distinguished fistful of composers they've brought together here.That said, I'd like a quick word with whoever made the selections here, as we clearly have very different ideas of what is sensual.Your first instinct comes from the album cover. What appears to be a nude woman shaped like a cello (which is more attractive than such a description would initially suggest). Classy and sexy--well done! Start us off with Offenbach's Barcarole, and we're getting along nicely. Things get a tad awkward at the Habanera from Carmen, but we make due. Tchaikovsky's isn't exactly what I'd call 'sensual', but it isn't jarring.It isn't until the grandiose, thumping climax of Bolero that you have to wonder if someone isn't asleep at the wheel here. Again, these are all exquisite pieces of music, but the operative word promised here was 'sensual'. Things get back to sorts with the cascading tenderness of pieces like The Swan and Claire de Lune's Moonlight, but then they wheel out the freaking Sabre Dance, a song scientifically proven to be as romantic and sensual as a dog riding a unicycle. You're delicately running your hands down the small of a woman's back and suddenly you expect to see a man spinning plates in the corner of your bedroom.This is a tremendous collection of music--please don't misunderstand me. And for two dollars I'm thrilled to own so much grandeur. But perhaps a more general title was in order before sensuality was promised. My suggestion? \"66 Randomly Selected Classics\". It might not be as exciting, but it isn't false advertising.\n", "val": 0.01738573983311653}

I deleted a handful of tracks from my iTunes library because they seemed out of place and some even quite annoying in a so-called sensual collection. I couldn't possibly call the frenetic Sabre Dance sensual, nor is the jarring rendition of Bolero (if you want to hear a lovely and unique recording of that one, check out Pink Martini's.)  Greensleeves, La Vie Parisienne Overture, and Easy Blood Polka, Op. 319 also just didn't really work in the theme, not that they're unpleasant pieces of music, but they just don't mesh. Greensleeves is a little hokey at this point.  That piece makes me think of any cheesy sitcom in which characters visit a Ren Faire and the writers have never been to one, Greensleeves is invariably what they'll play. It has become lazy TV writer's shorthand for \"We are at a Ren Faire now.\"  As for La Vie Parisienne, well, overtures are just too grand for the theme of the compilation.  Wine, Women, and Song is also just too big for it. Easy Blood is an okay piece of music, but polkas are not at all romantic.  There are a few others that had to go as well.  Some other pieces are little clich&eacute;d, but certainly likeable enough to keep. A few pleasantly took me by surprise. For example, most recordings of Moonlight Sonata usually sound very sad, this one comes off as more relaxing.After all, I'd say it is worth the few bucks they charge for it.  I have it on frequently for background noise.\n", "val": 0.0002716275630518794}

What you get for your download time is 500Mb of assorted classical pieces performed by a broad variety of ensembles, many of of them probably hailing from the el cheapo classical CDs of the 1980s and 1990s.

{"text": "In what is definitely the most important score release of the year we finally have the definitive release of Ennio Morricone's masterpiece. Days Of Heaven is director Terrence Malick's second feature and some may argue his best film. It's also surprisingly his shortest clocking in at 93 minutes even though it took a good year to edit. Malick's first film didn't have an original score, so this would be his first time working with a film composer. The end result, while not conventional, did leave us with one of the greatest scores in film history.Now, I could write for days about Morricone and Malick (but I won't). Malick happens to be tied for my favorite director and Morricone in my eyes is the greatest film composer to have ever lived. The way Morricone's music accentuates this tale about rationality failing to overcome emotions is dreamlike and sublime. If the idea of heaven were to have a score it would be this. However, the score is multilayered with many motifs. Morricone foreshadows tragedy with the music so when things finally erupt all hell does indeed break loose. Now, Malick did do some shifting around. Almost all the music you hear in the final film wasn't really intended to be where it was. Morricone did give him the rare permission to move things around. The only cue he wanted to stay put was the fire scene, and Malick kept it where Morricone wanted it. I think the music functions flawlessly in the film and it's due to the quilt-like nature of the score and Malick's signature flow of narrative. Malick still opted for a few classical pieces that sort of anchored his themes, but this is indeed a film driven by an original score unlike The New World of The Tree Of Life. The ending is haunting and the score reflects it. The music leaves a lasting impression as we are taken to the credits. The score is the very definition of a masterpiece.For this release FSM may have put out their best CD yet. Previously only a few tracks were available on a combo album from GSM that included Two Mules For Sister Sarah and a handful of tracks from Days Of Heaven. This 2-disc set includes the original 1978 soundtrack as well as the music in film order. The second disc houses pretty much all the music for the film as recorded including stuff that never made the final cut. It is indeed as complete a package as one could hope for. All remastered to the highest quality of course.This monumental release is cause for celebration and is a must buy for any filmmaker, film buff or score aficionado. It's very rare to see a release like this for a score with such a monumental significance. Now here's hoping one day we get something like this for Hans Zimmer's score to The Thin Red Line.\n", "val": 0.019203560426831245}
{"text": "Back in the early 1970s, soundtracks were still the half-forgotten stepchild of the recording industry. That all changed around the time of Jaws, Rocky, and Star Wars, but somehow Days of Heaven, one of Ennio Morricone's finest works, fell through the cracks. All we had was a 36 minute soundtrack that barely filled both sides of the LP. And that didn't even have the primary sources - the version of Saint-Sans' Aquarium on the LP was not the one in the film!So now, over 30 years later, someone has had the bright idea of taking this marvelous work and bringing it to us in full. We have over two hours of music on two CD's, about four times what we had before, and all wonderfully mastered. There's the music of the original soundtrack, all the cues from the original film, and a full CD of music from Morricone that largely didn't make it into the film. The music, however, is so descriptive that you can tell by listening where it might have gone, and how it might have changed the feel of the overall composition.Buying this version is a no-brainer, frankly. If you liked the original soundtrack, you've no choice but to get this version. Keep your old CD, because after 30 years you're used to the wrong version of Aquarium and you won't find that version here. And if you love the film and have never bought the soundtrack, the only one you'll need is right here. FSM releases sometimes go out of print - or they simply run out - with no warning, so if you're interested, pick it up. The two CD's are accompanied by a detailed booklet.One point - remember that this CD is taken from old master recordings and has some imperfections and occasional audible fuzziness. This is present on the original soundtrack CD as well and may well be the result of the recording levels being set too high at the original taping. But in no way should you let that change your mind. Grab this while it's available.\n", "val": 6.320932152448222e-05}

{"text": "Carolina Liar has been a band that has stayed just under the radar.  They have not grasped stardom as other trendy bands and it's shame.  Their first album Coming To Terms (2008) seemed destined for radio and rightfully should have gained popular status.  It might have been their marketing that restrained their stardom because their name does not hold a lot of credence in the rock world.  For those just discovering Carolina Liar, they will remind many of European influenced rockers like The Killers (especially from Hot Fuss) or even some of Coldplay's material.  Yet, I  never like to compare or give any labels to bands due to it always overwhelming new listener's judgments.Coming To Terms was a great album, but showed signs of debut inexperience that Wild Blessed Freedom (2011) does not fall victim to.  It's almost a continuation of Coming to Terms in regards to it's feel, but it is more polished and adds some pop influence among it's alternative rock roots.  The lyrics are smart and the melodies are placed exactly where they should be.1.) Miss America - 3.5/5 - Carolina Liar has always been a band that seems to hold much pride in their lyrics.  They never seem to get lazy in their lyrics because it has always been evident that each sentence has meaning and substance.  Miss America is exact proof of their intention.  It is obviously about not only America itself, but to females as well.  It holds a double meaning if one were to listen to the lyrics carefully.  The choruses and bridges are fit for any pop record, however, this is alternative rock music the way it's meant to be.  Even if the symbolism has been done (maybe even overused), it's a great song.2.) No More Secrets - 4.5/5 - This song has a bit more pop influence than their first album offered.  However, for those who judge a song because it does have pop appeal should know that Carolina Liar has not lost their edge, they have perfected it.  Therefore, the song being \"pop\" is only pop because its catchy chorus and bridge that seems fit for radio, but not as a #1 song.3.) Drown - 3/5 - The first single of the album.  It's a good song, but could have been just another song on the album.  There doesn't seem to be any part of the song that differentiates it from others, save for the lyrics.  They are meaningful.  Yet, speaking on \"single\" terms, it doesn't seem to be as radio friendly as others on the album.4.) Me and You - 4/5 - When it comes to relationships and women, Carolina Liar has never shied away from using them as topics in their songs.  Obviously, Me and You is a reference to a relationship.  It's a great track that shows it's greatness in its bridges and choruses.  Seems like it could have easily been on their first album in regards to it's lyrics.5.) Beautiful People - 5/5 - The first song that differentiates itself from others.  The vibe is dark and the lyrics tell a story of seduction and heartbreak.  The music and instrumentation seem to go to another level for the band on this record.  It's a slower song, but don't expect it to be romantic.  One of my favorite songs on the album.6.) King of Broken Hearts - 4/5 - This track seems to follow Beautiful People perfectly.  It continues the song of \"heartbreak,\" but adds more of an upbeat vibe to it.  It's a song of redemption from a broken heart.  The way of getting over it are told within in the lyrics beautifully.  A great song.7.) I Don't Think So - 5/5 - Lyrically, this is another gem.  Musically, it's a gem as well.  It sounds like a perfectly written poem that has substance worth discovering.  One of the best songs on the album.8.) Daddy's Little Girl - 3.5/5 - The first \"dance\" song on the album.  It seems to come out of nowhere compared to the track before it.  However, it works.  \"Daddy's little girl is dirty on the floor/she's dancing/she's dancing.\"  The lyrics will remind anyone of the classic story of a girl who might not be as innocent as she presents herself to be.  There are many of them in clubs and bars across the world and it seems as if everyone knows at least one.  But it has more to say than just a story of a girl.  It's a song about letting lose and independence.9.) Feel Better Now - 4/5- This is a track that will remind many of their song from their first LP, called \"Better Alone.\"  The vibe of the song has The Beatles or even U2 as a influence hue which gives the track a nostalgic feel, but explodes about 2 minutes into it with the band taking it to their own heights.10.) Never Let You Down - 3.5/5 - This track has a bit of a stadium rock vibe to it that only arrives during it's chorus, but feels more controlled and restrained throughout the verses.  It definitely sounds more rock than most of the album's offerings.11.) Salvation - 3/5 - The lyrics of Salvation propels it into a song that is much better than an average song from the band.  The chorus seems to be a bit off, in respect to it's generic hints.  But the lyrics hold it up.12.) All That Comes Out of My Mouth - 4.5/5 - The second \"dance song\" and maybe the most pop inspired track on the album.  The vibe is infectious.  It has the potential to a smash on the radio.  The only thing that holds it back from being the best song on the album is the lyrics and edited chorus that seems to be more of a distraction than anything else.  Carolina Liar fans from the past might not be too proud of their direction on this song, but no one can say it isn't catchy and does exactly what they wanted it to do.  Having at the end of the album might be a hint as to what it to come from the band in the future.Wild Blossom Freedom is a very solid alternative rock album.  Carolina Liar fans will love it and new fans will enjoy its broad range of vibes and meaningful lyrics.  It is one of the better albums of the year.  Download a couple of songs to see for yourself.  Chances are after listening to a couple of the tracks, the entire album will be in your collection.\n", "val": 0.003836933756247163}

{"text": "\"Singing From the Heart\" is a real high-wire act from a band that's so used to going out on the edge that they make it look effortless. The CD is all gospel, all a capella, and all quartets (except for one quintet).The singing is technically brilliant, of course. The pleasant surprise here is the passion and excitement that Dailey and Vincent and their guests (a bluegrass all-star cast including Doyle Lawson, Shawn Lane, and more) managed to capture in the studio. \"Singing From the Heart\" is every bit as thrilling as a D & V live show. The only thing missing is the stage banter.There are lovely, breathtaking versions of favorites here, including \"Amazing Grace\", \"Near the Cross\", \"Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho\", and \"The Old Rugged Cross\" among others. Each is completely fresh and interesting. \"The Old Rugged Cross\", with its country gospel quintet arrangement, is especially beautiful.The singers excel on tunes from the black gospel tradition. Two songs that are a part of their current live shows -- \"Moses Smote the Water\" and \"Don't You Wanna Go to Heaven? -- are standout examples of this, and two of the CD's strongest tracks.All in all, this CD is breathtaking. Don't miss it.\n", "val": 0.039355527609586716}

{"text": "I know I'll get a lot of flak for this review, because love is blind, but honestly this is not close to their best work. I LOVE gospel hymns. I also like acapella and have sung it, but I have two problems with this recording, 1, it is TOTALLY acapella. Think about how much time it really takes to produce an acapella album, they probably spent more time to pick out the songs they wanted to use, but you are paying FULL price as if they had all that time and effort in instrumental background. You know I'm telling the truth. 2, if you really understand and have an ear for music, the person who produced this work did a horrible job. You may love this album, and don't let my review sway you, but if you listen to this album closely, it sounds as though they are singing through an old floor fan, like I would when I was young, I MEAN IT'S BAD! Whoever produced this and their latter albums do not know how to use reverb or digital delay correctly. If the group has a natural singing voice vibrato - great, but don't try to digitally do it or it sounds wierd. Personally, I think their first recording was the best. They do an EXCELLENT job in person, they just need a better person to mix and adjust their recordings and never produce a totally acapella recording.\n", "val": 6.325852882582694e-05}

I'd stash them into the techno/dance genre but unlike a lot of techno and dance which basically relies on its dance beat and repeats the same 2-3 lines over and over again through out the song, Nero steps it up and *gasp* actually writes lyrics. Shock me shock me with that deviant behavior! I would compare them more to daft punk then probably anyone else and they are just as good. I'll be looking out for this up and coming band. For this download I do have to say for the first few seconds you may go \"huh? What am I listening too\", but stick with it, it's well worth it.\n", "val": 0.030117874965071678}

Yeah, seriously; this song is amazing.  It draws heavily from a 90's dance palate, but it stokes the coals with remarkable depth of energy, creating something completely modern and unique.  The eerie undertones that corrode the dynamic musical progression of the songs climax is perfectly played, adding an edge to the track that screams for attention.

What my mother would have a hard time with is that Cottrell soon adds a new refrain for the hymn. What she would have an even harder time with is that he creates new lyrics for a stanza or two.We all know that this approach can work well. Look at Chris Tomlin's \"Amazing Grace.\" True, Tomlin's \"new lyrics\" are an original stanza that before his recording was seldom, if ever, sung or heard. But Tomlin's arrangement will be sung for a decade or longer.I like Cottrell's arrangement, but I don't think it is quite as captivating as Tomlin's \"Amazing Grace.\" I don't think it will be sung widely or for very long.

{"text": "If you are a fan of Oh, Sleeper or metal, you will not be disappointed by this album. The album definetely makes its point through its music and lyrics. The reason I became a fan of this artist was for its lyrics, as the music was initally a little too hard for my liking. What drew me in was being completely confused by an album titled \"When I Am God.\" I listened to it for a while and it grew on me. So I read the lyrics after listening. Now that I've grown accustumed to the sound, I can see how technical and carefully woven all the albums are from Oh, Sleeper. I hope this may help people who would otherwise be deterred by this type of music give it a chance.I can't seem to stop listening to this CD, it is truly a work of art. The grueling screams combined with melodic singing, the trash found in the background such as in 'Hush Yael', deep base, insane guitars, and phenomenal drumming are an accurate discription of of sound for this album--Though, I doubt I can find the right words without making this an extremely lengthy review to explain it better.

I clearly underestimated them because \"Children of Fire\" is blowing me away.Being 20 years old, I feel like this band has been growing musically and lyrically with me. Aside from the impact they have had on my faith, I feel like I can sit, listen and digest their music for hours on end. The one thing I appreciate the most about Oh, Sleeper is the fact that they never just scratch the surface, especially not with \"Children of Fire\". Oh, Sleeper's lyrics force you to have questions because seem to love making you dig deeper and deeper into the lyrics for the answers, this is something I cannot get enough of. Bottom line is that YOU NEED THIS ALBUM. Don't skip tracks, go from front to back, its a big story-driven roller coaster that will leave you wanting more and more.

Songs in \"Children Of Fire\" can also be beautifully soothing at times, like in \"The Conscience Speaks\" & \"Means To Believe.\" Also, the great vocals present during the sung choruses remind me of Thrice. Oh, Sleeper is a diverse band who's album's sound quality has evolved along with their music since their initial release.  I only wish I found this album to be as catchy as \"Son of the Morning.\"The opening track on \"Children OF Fire\" bursts with energy, and the album's closing track doesn't loose that intensity!

Each song is a masterpiece that make this album as a whole totally awesome. The lyrics are deep, meaningful and passionate, and Micah's screams make them come to life in the music. The guitars are awesome, they lay some great groundwork for the pounding drums and bass. I know this is an overused term, but Oh, Sleeper's overall sound has matured immensely from their previous release Son of The Morning. There were one or two tracks I didn't much care for, but the rest of the album more than makes up for them. I give this album a 4.5/5.

{"text": "I truly loved Son Of The Morning, so I wondered what Oh, Sleeper would do that could top it... I was actually kind of worried about a \"junior\" rather than a \"sophomore slump\".  Well, I realized I worried for nothing after I heard Children Of Fire for the first time!  I have to say that this album, while having lyrics that tell wonderful stories with challenging subjects, rests squarely on the shoulders of lead shred-meister Shane Blay.  I dare say Shane has spent the time since SOTM in his woodshed... and it's walls must be splattered with the vestages of unused riffs and solos that most bands would kill to have as the foundation of one of their songs.The OS guys have crafted an album packed with songs that make you feel... and I mean more than just the ringing in your ears.  Songs like \"Hush Yael\" (which as a dad tears my guts out every time it plays... but I just can't hit the \"skip\" button) and \"The Family Ruin\" underscore what's truly wrong with us as people and a society.  Then, Oh, Sleeper brings you thought provoking hope and faith again with tracks like \"Children of Fire\" and \"Means to Believe\" (which was originally written for Blay's solo project, Anullaby).This is an album that punches you square in the mouth and screams \"LISTEN TO ME!\"  I suggest you do what it says!Top Tracks:  \"Endseekers\", \"The Family Ruin\", \"Children of Fire\"\n", "val": 0.0005250989925116301}

NOT the best jumping off point for the welcoming in of a new musical experience, but I had already listened to this album in its entirety and thought it was a cheerful, eclectic listen.I LOVE just about all these songs in their original incarnations. I will admit that I consider the OMT (\"Original Muppet Trilogy\") to be canon; I hold it up to the same (well, not quite) esteem as I do the Original Star Wars trilogy. I'm of course talking about THE MUPPET MOVIE, THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER and THE MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN. The songs from those movies I think are interesting, though ultimately unnecessary reworkings of classic movie soundtrack songs. The songs from the Muppet Show (with the obvious exception of the Main Theme and Ma-Na-Ma-Nah or however its spelled) aren't as familiar to me and are actually made even less interesting for it.There are some good bands that cover some of these songs, and others that I've never heard of and are quite forgettable.If you've got 8 bucks to burn you can listen to a lot worse, but after listening to it a few times it's unfortunately more of a merchandising tie-in (albeit a creative idea for one) than a legitimate musical creation that stands on its own.Getting there is half the fun, come share it with me!\n", "val": 0.0002552559308242053}

{"text": "Today I heard the \"Rainbow Connection\" remake on Alt Nation and immediately came to Amazon to buy the MP3 album. This seems like an EXCELLENT collection of old Muppet favorites, covered by some of today's most inspired rock and indie artists.I say \"seems like\" because, unfortunately, I cannot listen to the whole album. The Amazon Digital/MP3 version is incomplete--clearly some sort of technical glitch on Amazon's end. When I download the album and import it to iTunes, almost ALL of the tracks are cut short. (Tried it 3 times, just to be sure.) For example, \"Rainbow Connection\" shows as being 4:00 long on the Amazon.com track listing, but the iTunes import is only 1:15, cutting out in the middle of the 2nd stanza. Oddly, when I play the song on Amazon Cloud Drive, it shows the track length as being 4:00, but it also stops playing at 1:15.This is disappointing to say the least. I've submitted a Help request to Amazon, but there's no telling how long it will take to correct. I'm hoping--based on all the positive reviews I'm seeing for this album--that this is an isolated issue Amazon will be able to fix promptly. But it makes me fret for the other 30-or-so Amazon MP3 albums I've bought--are they broken, too? Time to give them all a careful listen.If Amazon corrects the problem, I'll edit this review. Until then, I've gotta stick with the 1 star to call attention to the problem with Amazon's digital version. (Yes, I know reviews should be based mostly on the PRODUCT. But when the VENDOR cannot deliver the whole product, prospective buyers have a right to know. For now... Caveat emptor.)---[EDIT - 8/31 at 4:50 PM]Amazon responded quickly to my Help request. They initiated a full refund, and told me to delete the songs from iTunes and my Amazon Cloud Drive and re-purchase/re-download them. I did as instructed, but 3 tracks still have problems. They are:Track 3 - Mahna Mahna - The Fray - Should be 3:33; downloads as 2:13Track 7 - Mr. Bassman - Sondre Lerche - Should be 2:41; downloads as 0:38Track 12 - I'm Going To Go Back There Someday - Rachael Yamagata - Should be 6:45; downloads as 4:16I issued a follow-up response to explain the remaining track problem and am awaiting further updates/fixes from Amazon.\n", "val": 5.4302825446939096e-05}

{"text": "\"The Green Album\" is a tribute to the Muppets to help promote the upcoming movie \"The Muppets\" and includes 12 tunes that sound awesome! If you're old like me, you're sure to remember this zany bunch of characters including Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy. The songs from the show were classic and helped define each episode. And now they've been re-made with a modern rock-punk-indie feel to it. The results are fun, the music is great, and talk about re-living some child memories! OK Go gets things started with the \"The Muppet Show Theme Song\" and they couldn't have done better. The tune has a melodic groove and is filled with fuzzy distortion. It's catchy, as it was back in the day, but the best part about it is OK GO seem to be genuinely enjoying themselves. Even Weezer seem to be having fun as they team up with Paramore's Hayley Williams and belt out \"Rainbow Connection\" (originally sung by Kermit from 1979's \"The Muppet Movie and nominated for an Oscar). The result is, believe it or not, beautiful! One of the most catchiest songs is \"Mahna Mahna,\" sung by The Fray with all the original silliness fully embraced. The piano and hand claps really add to the song and you'll be nodding your head in no time. My Morning Jacket add their own unique touches to \"Our World\" and make it sound like it could belong on one of their own albums. A banjo and slide guitar add a cool texture, and the sound is amazing. \"Mr. Bassman,\" performed by Sondre Lerche, features a cool acoustic guitar and is a great change of pace. Brandon Seller picks the pace back up on \"Night Life\" which is one of the faster, more rockin' songs on the album. The guitar rocks and there's  a great drum solo. It simply sounds incredible. Andrew Bird sings \"Bein' Green,\" my personal favorite. With a country influenced fiddle and crisp drumming, it has a lot of energy and is just beautiful. \"I Hope That Something Better Comes Along,\" originally sung by the dog Rowlf, is brought phenomenally back to life by Matt Nathanson. Who better to sing about dog related puns? Overall, The Green Album is a fun, worthy tribute to a bunch of my childhood idols. Highly recommended!\n", "val": 0.06104450300335884}

I'm glad I watched that video because it prepped me for what this album delivers! I've listened to it nonstop all day long- at work, at the gym, and right now as I write this review! If you're on the fence about Tisto's new style and approach, just watch the making of the video and give the album a listen. You'll be pleasantly surprised with the direction he's taking. For those of you who can't watch the making of video I'll just sum it up by saying he's combined a whole bunch of genre's for an ecclectic mix of music. There's still the catchy melodies like in trance but there's also intense bass lines, amazing hooks, and a ton of unique sounding vocals you don't usually hear in Tisto's selections. Be open and try this album out. Songs on constant rotation are \"Girls with Bangs\", \"Bullets\", \"Don't Ditch\", \"We Rock\", \"Zero 76\", and \"C'Mon\".\n", "val": 0.016393031924962997}

{"text": "I was pretty hardcore into the trance/house scene from 2001-2003 when I was wrapping up college.  Back then deep progressive house reigned supreme with guys like John Digweed, Satoshi Tomiie, Danny Howells, Steve Lawler and many others.  Back then I loved Tiesto's Magik and ISOS albums but the two times I saw him live were very underwhelming.  After a 7 year layoff I got back into the dance scene in 2010 only to see how dramatically the landscape has shifted.  When my friends and I heard Tiesto established a monthly residency at the Hard Rock in Vegas, I had to give him one last shot to hear him live.  I'm so glad I gave him another chance as not only did he not disappoint but it may have been the best live performance I've seen in the last year topping even Armin and Markus Schulz!  What I loved most about his set was that he know longer spun his usual trancy tracks but evolved into a whole new style of uplifting and beaty house.This album does well in capturing the magic and energy I felt that night I saw him in Vegas.  Much like his live set he mixes it up a bit with the happy vocal house tracks along with the some entertaining beat driving progressive tunes that set and sustain your mood throughout the evening.  One thing I've noticed since returning to dance is the copious number of songs with uplifting and melodic piano and guitar riffs.  This album has plenty of tracks that feature many insatiable piano melodies melded together with well produced electronic beats.  I would highlight some of my favorite tracks but I would say overall it's just a magnificent mix.While I truly appreciate dj's that go out on a limb and like to produce experimental mixes  when they release cd's but what I enjoy above anything else is a album that brings me back to how it felt to hear and see that dj perform live.  The tone, energy and overal quality of this album is exactly what you should expect when you see him live.  Listening to this over and over just excites me to see him at EDC and hopefully one or two more trips to the Hard Rock before the year ends!\n", "val": 0.03327832743525505}

The clicking noise that was formerly audible in the background of most of the tracks has indeed been removed from the MP3s.  It still  has not been repaired in the sample tracks.  But I was curious enough to download it anyway, and the tracks have indeed been fixed.THE MUSICI own a large library of classical music.  There are two primary reasons to purchase a compilation like this.  It can either be used an introduction to a variety of classical music or out of the laziness of not wanting to make it yourself by picking the more relaxing movements from your collection.  I gave in for the second reason.  The music is excellently selected.  It's always nice to listen to complete works in their entirety.  But sometimes it is nice to have a relaxing playlist that won't surprise you with the occasional loud or fast movement.  Then again, this compilation does have a few that could fit that category, such as \"Sylvia\" which is track 11 on disk 2.For some reason, half the tracks list the performers and the other half list the composers.  Here are the composers for all.Disk 1Track 1 - J.S. BachTrack 2 - DebussyTrack 3 - BeethovenTrack 4 - JanacekTrack 5 - HandelTrack 6 - J.S. BachTrack 7 - Saint-SaensTrack 8 - Saint-SaensTrack 9 - Saint-SaensTrack 10 - PaillardTrack 11 - ChopinTrack 12 - SibeliusTrack 13 - TchaikovskyTrack 14 - MozartDisk 2Track 1 - BrahmsTrack 2 - BeethovenTrack 3 - J.S. BachTrack 4 - BoccheriniTrack 5 - Johann Strauss IITrack 6 - MozartTrack 7 - MascagniTrack 8 - MussorgskyTrack 9 - TchaikovskyTrack 10 - Johann Strauss IITrack 11 - DelibesTrack 12 - Carl OffTrack 13 - ShostakovichTrack 14 - MendelssohnTrack 15 - Rimsky-KorsakovCONCLUSIONThe performances are good quality and the sound quality is acceptable.  The title is absurd.  But maybe they were going for irony.  Maybe they meant this was the most relaxing classical music in the entire multi-verse.  One or two track changes might be necessary for that claim.Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.0003622586955316365}
{"text": "This seemed like a bargain, but some of the tracks have random low level clicking noises. You can even hear the noise if you listen carefully to the short sample of track 2 on Disk 1 - Clair de Lune. Not very loud but it is there. I missed it before the download, but discovered the noise after buying the album. There are maybe 4 or 5 tracks with this very low level noise on Disk 1. Disk 2 seems to be OK, but I did not listen to all the tracks completely. I notified Amazon and they gave me a refund and said to wait a few days to give their technicians time to correct the defective tracks before downloading again. Otherwise the music selection is good and most are well played - I would give it 4 stars if no defects.\n", "val": 0.0005855311173945665}

It's so nice to know who composed pieces of music since I am not a classical expert. My question is: Why doesn't amazon get a clue? People want to know who the composer! They list composers/singers etc. for other \"Various Artist\" products but not for classical music. It's a pain to have to input the composer (again thanks to Mark) name. Anyway, the music is grand and pretty relaxing.

{"text": "Oceans smacks of Green Day, with a good driving beat and especially in its almost matter-of-fact vocals, both of which work pretty well. Where this all changes is in the backup \"vocals,\" which have some nice conventional harmonies, but are also punctuated with what is really just screaming. And while musically I'm not necessarily a big fan of screaming, in this song, it works for me. Because the screaming brings a raw quality to the sound that fits with the character and ambiance of the song itself, wrestling with the experience of loving and worrying about someone who is stationed in a war zone overseas (\"a never-ending summer in the sand is not vacation\"). The expectancy coupled with the dread that is never quite there but never fully gone come through well. So this song makes for pretty good listening, and it also gives voice to an important experience in today's society that often isn't recognized. Especially for free, it's worth a listen. (While the album is marked \"Explicit,\" I didn't find anything in the lyrics of this song that would so qualify.)\n", "val": 0.0161063764244318}

From the angry \"WTF\", the honest \"Apology\", to the personally uplifting title song, \"Change Begins With Me\" is a complete package. The subject matter really hits hard if you allow yourself to let your personal experiences blend into the songs. Matt's solid voice carries strongly throughout even when showing great vulnerability.\"WTF\" steals the show with it's high energy and danceable beat. The two included remixes bring a different angle to the song but the original is still my fav. While other songs on the album are being promoted as ear-catchers I find the real hidden gem is \"I'll Always Remember.\" It's backtrack finds a comfortable place in your head and remains there playing throughout the day. The Broadway-trained Zarley really exploits his roots when singing \"Change Begins With Me.\" I can imagine the song as the climactic show stopper of a coming-of-age musical. The only misstep is \"Trust Me\" which suffers from trying too hard to be hip. It's out of place amongst all the other solid songs of heartfelt passions.Allow this album to roll over you several times and you'll find yourself coming back whenever you want your emotions to go for a ride.NOTE: be sure to check out the WTF video. It's an over-the-top campy romp that's a wink back to the fun videos of the '90's. Fun, fun, fun!\n", "val": 0.011618259362876415}
{"text": "Dionne Bromfield's Good for the Soul sounds like an instant classic from start to finish.  No surprise in a way, as the Brit Neo-Soul pop artist's production team have borrowed styles from some of the best, including Phil Spector, Al Green, Motown's Ashford & Simpson, and a whole host of other American R&B superstars from the 1950s through the 1970s, as well as her own soulful mentor, the late, great Amy Winehouse.  But this is no mere throwback. Dionne has a strong voice and delivery style of her own to bring to the mix, and these original songs, mostly collaborations between Ms. Bromfield and some of the UK's finest songwriters, such as Steve Booker (Duffy, Lindsay Lohan, Natalie Imbruglio), and Francis White (Duffy, Diana Vickers), capture the genuine upbeat energy and excitement of the classics.  Her singing is as nuanced and articulate as the greats of yesteryear, yet paradoxically fresh.  As a native Detroiter who grew up with the Motown Sound in the 1960s and 70s, I can vouch for the authenticity of style and feel, as it takes me right back to those days, but without sounding hokey or anachronistic.  The playing and arrangements are tight and in the pocket on every song.  In fact, the CD's a sonic textbook for anyone interested in learning the techniques of classic R&B orchestration and production with a modern twist. Having said all that, it's greatest attribute is that it's just great fun, and has got to make anyone with a shred of rhythm want to get up and dance.\n", "val": 0.02275974676012993}

{"text": "Ashes Remain recently popped up as an Amazon Recommendation after a recent Christian Rock purchase.  I've been away from Contemporary Christian music for the last 5 years -- so, I'm not really in the know of 'Who's Who' in this particular genre.  But, I do know what I like - and \"What I've Become\" was an album I wanted to immediately purchase.  Yes, they are rocky; but, much more than having a driving beat -- their music is lyrically complex.  An example of this comes from the song, End of Me, that says \"Black and white melt into gray, 'til every truth is stripped away, when nothing's wrong, nothing's okay, everyone has been betrayed!\"This album is refreshingly different than other 'artists' out there with all-fluff-no-substance lyrics.  In my opinion, the lyrics shows a depth in doctrinal understanding of contemporary teachings of the Christian faith.  Warning:  Listening to this album with headsets on in the middle of Cubical City at work, may cause one to unconsciously head bang, fist pump, and sing out loud -- resulting in strange looks from coworkers as they pass by....(of course, I wouldn't know anything about that -really). :-)\n", "val": 0.01344393752515316}

The songs are well thought-out and fit together. There has been a several year gap between albums. My advice to Ashes Remain -  get into the studio more often so the albums come out more frequently.

{"text": "Okay, so I listen to all kinds of rock:  From TFK to Skillet to Theory of a Deadman and Shinedown:  These guys are right there!  Too many Christian rock bands all sound the same: no real power.  These guys should be up at the top of the rock charts.  Anywho, here's an evaluation of each song:1.  Keep Me Breathing:  A solid rock song with a good chorus.  It is very powerful, and a great opener as it shows what the rest of the album is going to be like.  7/102.  On My Own:  Wow!  Just great!  Powerful, great lyrics, great instruments, great voice.  Flawless, but in order to show how great other songs are, I have to rate it 9/10.3.  Everything Good:  So I don't listen to much \"Christian music\", just songs from Christian bands.  I find a lot of them to be chessy, but this song is actually really good.  A new sound for them, but they hit it.  9/10.4.  Without You:  Get it.  Don't even think twice.  Even people who aren't huge rock fans will love this song.  It was written about his brother and is just flat-out awesome.  He puts a lot of soul into this one.  10/10.5.  Come Alive:  First one of their's I heard and couldn't believe it was a Christian band.  Great song.  9/10.6.  Unbroken:  Running out of time, so I'll keep it short.  It's a good song.  Solid, but not overpowering.  7/10.7.  End of Me:  Probably my favorite of their's.  Really really good.  Definite buy!  10/10.8.  Right Here:  Another really good one.  8/10.9.  Change My Life:  See #3.  A little more rock than \"Everything Good\".  But good message too.10.  Take it Away:  Very rock, but kind of messy.  Not my favorite of their's.  5/10.11.  Inside of Me:  Likewise, not that great, but still pretty good.  6/10.12.  I Won't Run Away:  AWESOME!!!!  Great ending to a great album!  Love the guitar too!  9/10.So overall, if you want a CD you can just put on shuffle and listen to all of the songs, get this one!  Honestly, one of my favorite bands!  Buy the whole album, not just a song or two.\n", "val": 0.016037670895457268}

I was sooo glad I did after I listened to the whole thing. I bought CD's of 7 other well known groups that night and this one is my favorite. The music is rich and full with plenty of bass. The electric guitarist is awesome. Lead vocals are great with words enunciated so you can understand them. Each song has a good Christian message. This is not 'screamo' music. It's good solid Christian hard rock, just edgy enough to not be boring. Great melodies with a fantastic blend of instruments. This group is bound to hit the big time before long, and they deserve it.

{"text": "Baltimore Christian modern rock outfit Ashes Remain has undoubtedly produced one of the modern rock highlights of 2011. Full of hooks and great songs, `What I've Become' hits all the right buttons whilst harnessing it to a hard edge that fans of Skillet and Kutless will fully appreciate. Held together by Rob Hawkins (Disciple, Fireflight) uncluttered production this album has the appeal to crossover into the secular market and at the same time be relevant in both the rock and the pop markets. Opener `Keep Me Breathing' boasts a chugging guitar riff, killer hook and a sublime guitar solo, whilst the undoubted jewel in crown is the Skillet-like `On My Own'. Of the more ballad like material on offer, the Remedy Drive tinged `Without You' complete with powerful finale, and the electro-acoustic pop of `Everything Good' demonstrate a band that do \"finesse\" as well as \"crunch\". Although if it's low end clout you're after then look no further than the `Take It Away' or `Inside of Me' which have enough going on to keep the hard rockers happy. Special mention should also go to the quite brilliant `Change My Life' ,a piano driven Remedy Drive style song with a punchy guitar led chorus, but to be honest-save for the slightly dull `Come Alive'-it`s all high quality punchy modern rock albeit a little generic.Whilst winning no awards for originality whatsoever `What We've Become' nevertheless deserves high praise for it's great songs, high quality musicianship and overall consistency making this an album one of the surprises of 2011.\n", "val": 0.017397906631231308}

My biggest pet peeve is when you hear a good band that just doesn't push or \"reach for it\" in the studio but, as I listen to Gemini, the first track, it's apparent to me that the band put everything they had out there and it shows; the guitars are played with reckless abandon (you can literally hear how hard he's working that pick). the drums are completely untamed and the vocals...man, the vocals are fierce. While I am a longtime stoner-rock fan, I admit to having no prior experience with this band before this release but I'm a fan now and I can't wait to catch them live.

{"text": "Dead Roots Stirring is a great new album by Elder.  It combines awesome vintage hard rock aesthetics with newer heavy rock/metal instrumentation.  Super heavy guitars, thundering bass and kick-ass drums.  The singing is good too, he's got a nice gruff-sounding voice to fit with the music without having to scream or growl to sound heavy.  The best descriptor of this album is HEAVY, while still retaining good melodies and catchy riffs.  Its not overly fuzzed out of oblivion like other 70's metal revivalists and stoner rockers, its just the right amount of doom.  The shortest song is around 9 mins, so these babies are all epic jams with multiple movements in each song, so they definitely don't get boring.

It's officially my Pick of the Week...You've gotta get it and treat yourself. This band's tight, from NEIL MASON's big, fat, hit-you-in-the-gut drums & KELBY RAY's locomotive & reliable bass lines, (Einstein once said, \"The reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once,\"  so let's have an Amen for this rythym section,) to BEN BROWN & JAREN JOHNSTON's dual, roadhouse-worthy, twangy, guitars, (gotta love 'em!) and hang on to your hat, cause JOHNSTON delivers down and dirty, whiskey-soaked vocals, (with just enough yowl to complement that Southern Rock drawl.)I've got a music crush on their swaggering \"Whiskey Walk,\" (imagine Sunset Blvd. in the middle of Nashville,) from the opening riff to the group sing-a-long, (it works, trust me, you're gonna sing-a-long too,) you know you're hearing an instant rock anthem. (BTW, \"Wild and Young\" is the official theme of WWE NXT, do ya know them now?)

What do I like about it...some familiar songs (Something Good from Sound of Music, Laura) some I hadn't heard before, all hark back to the stellar days of songwriting when the lyrics were as important as the melody.  I don't know if it is MacFarlane's day job voicing animation, but the lyric delivery is crisp, clear and enunciated so you get the full impact.  His singing voice is very nice and expressive as well, reminiscent of Sinatra.  I do like the vocal flourishes that some reviewers are critical of (e.g., in \"It's Easy to Remember\") I find it thrilling and shows that MacFarlane has been studying vocal singing seriously and indeed has the chops.  I love the duets with Nora Jones and Sara Bareilles; I picture them in a period movie where there was witty dialogue and women were ladies (or sassy dames) and men were gentlemen.Keep recording Seth, we appreciate it!\n", "val": 0.030816255137324333}

She used to hear Sinatra live at the Palladium back in the day, as did my parents; Seth brings back Happy memories of a generation who came back from world wars to deeply immerse themselves in living life to the fullest, of which music was a huge part of that lifestyle. The vinyl version of this album is beyond compare in quality, and the CD will grace your stereo with a richness of sound not often heard in today's musical offerings, for it was recorded using the microphone that Frank actually used, with an incredibly talented, lively band. This album is a must-have for any serious music lover. Hope to hear more offerings from this astonishly talented artist.\n", "val": 0.035092923790216446}

Seth McFarlane, the goofball genius behind Stewie and Peter on \"Family Guy\" pays playful homage to some of the standards and showtunes of the '30's and 40's.And here's the thing:  it's actually really, really good!McFarlane lends his considerable vocal ability to covering a set of lushly orchestrated pieces from the early part of the 20th century.  Backed by a full orchestra, he pays respect to a full range of tunes, from \"Anytime, Anywhere\" to \"Love Won't Let You Get Away.\"  He lets his voice savor the melodies, playfully crooning out the notes to songs he clearly loves and has tremendous respect for.

Instead, he chose lesser known songs from the same era (plus one new song).  Seth's singing is good, but equal praise must go to the arrangements by Joel McNeely.

(And when discussing great singers, I don't mean to omit female vocalists like Billie Holliday, Ella Fiztgerald and Rosemary Clooney.)  Singing is more than just hitting the right notes and replicating vintage recording techniques.

If you like any of the well recorded male voices of the last twenty plus years, i.e., Michael Feinstein, Harry Connick, Jr., John Pizzarelli and Michael Buble, you will absolutely love Mr. MacFarlane's vocals.  In his very erudite liner notes, Mr. MacFarlane eloquently explains what he, his producer and recording engineer were attempting to accomplish with this exemplary recording.  I can only add that they achieved an A+ for effort AND results.The choice of tunes was outstanding and, again, an A+ for picking songs that have not been sung ad nauseam.  The only quibble I have in this respect is the choice of \"Laura.\"  Though it could be argued that this is an often recorded tune, you cannot find fault with Mr. MacFarlane's performance of this 'chestnut.'  In fact his performance of all these tunes is especially good.A rare Sinatra single from 1953, entitled \"Anytime, Anywhere\" gets a particularly great treatment with respect to the arrangement and performance.  He and Norah Jones do a fabulous duet with \"Two Sleepy People.\"  A Van Heusen and Cahn number, \"Love Won't Let You Get Away,\" is performed as another great duet with Sara Bareilles.  I know this number from a favorite LP by Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney entitled \"Fancy Meeting You Here.\"  Ms. Clooney also does a version of this tune on her Concord Records LP (CD?) \"Rosemary Clooney Sings the Music of Jimmy Van Heusen.\"  This newer duet version cedes no ground to the lovely original. The only original song was the final track co-written by Mr. MacFarlane entitled \"She's Wonderful Too.\"  Surprisingly, this tune works well with the older material produced on this CD.In the end, if you enjoy this style of American Popular Song, you will love Mr. MacFarlane's first, and hopefully not last, effort.\n", "val": 0.016576210036873817}

There is definitely something that this album could teach many of the \"pop stars\" of today about musicality and what \"cool\" and style are all about.That all being said, there is something missing for me in MacFarlane's vocals on a couple of the songs on this album, almost like he was trying too hard to imitate the Sinatra/Rat Pack style instead of singing his own songs...Either way, I own it, and will continue to listen because that little gap isn't enough to deter me from enjoying some great recordings!\n", "val": 0.004256485495716333}

{"text": "which harkens back to the classic American Songbook that was the meat of the classicalbums of Frank Sinatra, Nat Cole, and all the others from that era who made all those great albums with Capitol Records with the great arrangements of the two bestarrangers from that era, the legendary Nelson Riddle and Billy May.  Upon first listen I love the fact that MacFarlane has a pleasing baritone and he does not try to sound like Sinatra. He's got the chops and I find his singing milesabove Michael Buble. Also, MacFarlane was right for not attempting to do all the signature tunes that made Sinatra in the 1950s and went to lesser known material bymany of the same songwriters who supplied those classic tunes. He does, however, give a fine rendition of \"Anytime, Anywhere\" that Sinatra did as a single in the mid-50s when his teaming with Riddle was starting to gather strength.  MacFarlane also knows that having a good voice alone is not enough for the successof such an album. Without good arrangements you're dead in the water (a lot of reasons many of Dean Martin's albums didn't really do it for me) and he turned to one of our finest composers of film music, Joel McNeely, to supply the orchestrations, and he does a really first rate job. It is truly lamentable that both Riddle and May are no longer with us because MacFarlane is a singer who would be right up their alley. MacFarlane knows and respects the enormous contribution toAmerican music these two guys made and such a teaming would have been a ball. Parts of the album really appeal to my love of arrangers and their contributions and I also really like the \"Two Sleepy People\" duet with Norah Jones and also MacFarlane's take on the David Raksin-Johnny Mercer classic \"Laura.\" As fine an album as I think this is I think a second such album----should MacFarlane do anotherone, and I hope he does-----would give him a chance to really develop a style of hisown because I think some of his delivery is a wee bit generic sounding, but, this is only his first album. I look forward to that next one and I will continue to enjoy this one.  And yes, I'm a big \"Family Guy\" fan and a MacFarlane fan.

But the ballads (particularly \"Laura,\" and a spectacularly misfiring \"Easy To Remember\" -- the operatic flourish at the end hasn't been EARNED by anything that's preceded it) reveal zero emotional investment in the material -- he's far too concerned with his scoops and his vibrato to make us feel anything.  There's musicianship at work here, but no heart.  (Obviously I can't judge his actual level of emotional involvement -- he may have been feeling up a storm in the studio, but if he was, it certainly hasn't penetrated the recordings.)Vocally he's a dead ringer for Steve Lawrence (whom I generally like), with a fairly equivalent \"cheese factor.\"  He always seems a hairsbreadth away from throwing in a \"Jack!\"  al Sinatra at his most annoying.  While not nearly as cheesy as Bubl (whom I really can't stand), he verges on that Bobby Darin \"lounge act\" feel.If you like Michael Bubl, or the Rondstadt/Riddle stuff, this album will probably satisfy you.  I opt for fewer vocal pyrotechnics and more heart, so I'll stick with my Bennett, Crosby, Sinatra, Torme, and, yes, Steve Lawrence recordings.\n", "val": 4.386180080473423e-05}

{"text": "Seth MacFarlane's debut album impresses me; I never knew he could sing so well! True, some will say he's not quite on a par with Sinatra and the likes of the \"Rat Pack;\" and they have an undeniable point. Nevertheless, Seth sings these songs with a certain passion that is very convincing; he comprehends the importance of feeling emotions in the lyrics of these songs and it shows in his very good performance here. The duets with Norah Jones and Sara Bareilles work well and that's a plus. In addition, the sound quality is excellent and I like that artwork, too.There's really not a dud in the bunch; this is a solid debut CD and it makes me want more from Seth! He writes well in the CD liner notes; the big band/50's-60's type musical arrangements by Joel McNeely work very well. I also like the way Seth chose a mixture of pop songs--some quite popular when they were first introduced and others which are not too well remembered in our times.Of course, I have my personal favorites on this album as you will, too. \"It's Anybody's Spring\" and \"Music Is Better than Words\" start the track set off with Seth singing from the heart; the music that accompanies him enhances the songs even more. Seth croons beautifully on \"Anytime, Anywhere\" while \"The Night They Invented Champagne,\" a Lerner and Loewe classic from \"Gigi,\" gets the royal treatment from Seth who delivers this without ever letting go of a single superfluous note! \"Two Sleepy People\" features Norah Jones performing a duet with Seth; they sound great together and I hope they collaborate again! \"You're The Cream in My Coffee\" is easy on the ear while \"Something Good\" is most romantic. \"Nine O'Clock\" just plain sounds good and we get another duet, this one with Seth and Sara Bareilles who perform \"Love Won't Let You Get Away\" with panache.\"It's Easy to Remember\" and a number from \"The Music Man\" entitled \"The Sadder But Wiser Girl\" also demonstrate Seth's ability to do a cover song with sensitivity; and listen for another gem when Seth MacFarlane sings his rendition of \"Laura.\" \"You and I\" is very well done and the album ends strong with Seth performing \"She's Wonderful Too.\"Seth MacFarlane proves he has the vocal chops to sing alongside the best of them on this album. People who treasure classic pop vocals recorded the way they were recorded when the \"Rat Pack\" ruled will want this album for their collections. I hope we get more CDs by Seth and it would be terrific if he did a concert tour, too!\n", "val": 0.03983776271343231}
{"text": "America has given the music world many important gifts: jazz, blues, rockabilly, and bluegrass are a very abbreviated list. The Great American Songbook is on the short-list of the greatest contributions to mankind's body of music. Seth MacFarlane has produced an amazing collection of recordings from the GA Songbook.Most of the songs are not covered frequently by other artists. Perhaps my favorites are from well-known musicals (Sound of Music, The Music Man). Rich orchestration lends an authentic, big-band feel and MacFarlane's voice, while not perfect, is reminiscent of a cross between Mel Torme's and Frank Sinatra's.This item is highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.03845278546214104}
{"text": "I really wanted to like this album, and I have to say I'm very disappointed.  I'm also stunned by the number of glowing reviews it has accumulated, so let me offer a different perspective.  First I want to say that I'm a huge Family Guy fan, and I've especially enjoyed Seth's singing in the show over the years.  I'm also a big fan of the big band sound that Seth tries to reproduce here.  To be completely fair, considering that he is an amateur singer, the results here are quite passable (which is why I'm not giving it one star).  But passable isn't good enough, and anyone who tries to rank Seth with the greats (Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, etc.) is out of their mind.  Seth's voice is thin, his vibrato is weak, sometimes he sounds like he's trying too hard, and the overall effect is very sterile, like the music is a technical exercise instead of a living thing.  This is most evident on the duet with Norah Jones, whose warm, rich voice makes Seth sound ridiculous by comparison (I actually felt sorry for her while listening).  Also, Seth commits a cardinal sin with the song \"The Sadder but Wiser Girl\" (from the musical The Music Man, a MacFarlane favorite which he's dipped into several times on Family Guy): he changes the words!  And not a little, no: he completely rewrites the intro and adds a whole new verse.  This is a travesty, and the fact that Sinatra used to do the same thing does not excuse it (Sinatra was viciously, and rightfully, parodied for doing this).  Even letting this go, the song just doesn't work; the big band arrangement doesn't suit the material.  And as for the arrangements, they are reasonable but nothing spectacular.  So to anyone who thinks that this is the bee's knees, do yourself a favor and listen to Sinatra at the Sands and see what this music is really supposed to sound like.  I applaud the fact that Seth MacFarlane is pursuing his passion, but like Michael Jordan playing baseball, he should stick with what he's good at.\n", "val": 2.335417411813978e-05}
{"text": "I've been waiting YEARS for Seth to come out with a CD, he has a magnificent voice.  This selection of not-widely-known songs is quite nice - as Seth says in the liner notes, why sing the same old power standards when they've been done before, and done well?  These are beautiful songs, with a nice mix of soft and swing.  He even made me enjoy \"The Night They Invented Champagne\", a song I DETEST as originally presented in \"Gigi\", yet here it's presented smoothly.The reason for only 4 stars?  These songs are all sung within the same octave, or close to.  Seth has a larger vocal range yet the richness of his voice isn't best showcased here.  I do wish he had included at least one really well known standard to belt his heart out to, because he certainly has the talent for it.  His voice throughout this CD sounds hesitant, albeit gorgeous.  I wanted to hear him really belt out that smooth, rich baritone and make me FEEL it.  As it stands, this CD is lovely but doesn't move me.One thing that impresses me is that (as per the liner notes) most of the songs are done in one take, with the singer and orchestra together, and recorded on analog to get that distinctive crisp 1950's sound.  Nothing is too loud or overpowering, it's perfectly balanced.All in all, a lovely CD.  I sincerely hope he records more.\n", "val": 0.020642360672354698}

{"text": "Seth MacFarlane obviously thought carefully before he put this album together.  In the liner notes, he identifies the alchemy that made some classic pop albums so enduring; the mixture of great songs, terrific arrangements, and fine singing.  One reason Frank Sinatra is the touchstone for this music today is because he only did the best songs and chose top-notch arrangers to frame his voice.  MacFarlane has his own great arranger in Joel McNeely who successfully channels Nelson Riddle, Billy May, and Claus Ogerman, while not sounding derivative.  I love the way some of the songs lingered on as McNeely experiments with all the different sounds of a jazz orchestra.  Just like they used to do back in the day, MacFarlane gives McNeely arranging and conducting credit on the cover of the album.Another pitfall MacFarlane avoids is doing overly familiar tunes.  What's the point?  While there are several songs sung by Sinatra on the album (\"Laura,\"  \"Anytime, Anywhere,\" and \"It's Easy to Remember\"), there's several really good songs that are probably unfamiliar to modern audiences, even those who like classic pop.  I especially liked \"Music is Better than Words\" and \"Love Won't Let You Get Away,\" both of which were new to me.  On the other hand, there's songs that a singer like Sinatra probably would have eschewed such as \"You're the Cream in My Coffee\" and \"Something Good.\"Finally, unlike classic pop efforts by other contemporary singers, the album doesn't sound overproduced.  Apparently, MacFarlane recorded these songs live in the studio with the orchestra, just like they used to do in the old days.  There's a real spontaneity and warmth that you only get with a live performance.  MacFarlane has a great baritone voice - he could have made it as a band singer in the 1940's - and he knows how to do justice to these songs, although they could have cranked up the tempo just a little on some of the ballads.  Also, guest vocalist Sara Bareilles is a revelation.  She sounds as if she's channeling singer Keely Smith on her duet with MacFarlane on \"Love Won't Let You Get Away.\"In case it's not obvious, I love classic pop music, and I really liked this album.  Many older fans who would be inclined to buy it are probably unfamiliar with MacFarlane, but hopefully word of mouth will spread.  This deserves to be widely heard.\n", "val": 0.01335897296667099}

{"text": "As a person who thinks Family Guy is overrated and a very hit and miss show (in other words, I'm not a huge Seth MacFarlane fan), I looked at this CD and said \"he's got to be kidding\".Well, this CD is actually quite good.  Seth's voice is very, very good.  As Family Guy fans know, he does most of the voices for that show, and he also sings on Family Guy's musical numbers.  Recording a CD like this isn't that far of a jump for him, but to do one with great sincerity and to do it very well is impressive.  The band behind Seth is first class with great arrangements.  He even recorded the album/CD in the old studios where Sinatra recorded, and even used a special mike that they used back in the old days (the mike specifications elude me at the moment).When TV/film stars venture into singing territory, the results can be either mediocre (like Hugh Laurie's recent attempt at New Orleans blues), or a complete disaster (William Shatner's \"singing\" comes to mind).

{"text": "I heard about this album from a friend who excitedly told me about it \"You won't believe this!\" he said, and of course I did.  I know Seth Macfarlane loves music, especially broadway musicals and 40s and 50s jazz.  Of course he would record a collection of Jazz/Orchestral arrangements of classic lesser-known charts.  Of course he would record it the old fashioned way, on real tape, live along with the orchestra.  And of course, since it's Seth, he'd record it on Frank Sinatra's old microphone, at Frank's old stomping grounds, Capitol Records.So is it any good?  Hell yes!  This guy has a great voice, and terrific musical instincts.  I especially like how he's a truly masculine vocalist, like Frank and Dean were.  I don't mean he sings particularly low, but that he sings like a man.  It just seems to me that most male vocalists today are tenors, and lack the resonance of a good baritone.  What I also noticed from listening is that he's loving every minute of the music.  You can't fake sincerity, and you tell Seth pours his heart and soul into every song on this album.  I also really admire him for doing an album of music like this.  I'm a big fan of jazz and big band, and to see a big name like this essentially putting his stamp of approval on this kind of music is really encouraging.  I'd love to see more stuff like this.What about the music?  All first class charts with great arrangements.  I'm an instrumental musician, so I was curious about who he would get to play in the band.  It's basically all the top L.A. scene jazz guys, including a big chunk of Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band.  Wayne Bergeron, Andy Martin, Dan Higgins, Chuck Findley, Pete Christlieb, Bill Liston, WOW!  So you've got A+ musicians playing great arrangements; it wouldn't even matter who was singing.  If this were an instrumental album, I would still love it.  The musicians complement Seth's singing perfectly and I really can't think of any serious flaws with the album.  If you like Seth's singing from Family Guy, or you like the Big Phat Band, or you like Frank Sinatra and crooner jazz, or just jazz in general, this album is for you.Thank you Seth!

Unique as in \"there is no equal\". As with Norah Jones - It's the best example I can present of uniqueness. Just listen to her voice; Norah Jones brings a unequaled quality which Seth MacFarlane lacks. She is a wonderful singer, but the key difference (between MacFarlane) is that you won't hear another Norah Jones for decades to come. His monotone presentation of 'It's Easy To Remember (And So Hard to Forget)' refused to hold my attention for the 5 minute duration. I refer to the Bing Crosby uplifting tones or the broad range of Billie Holiday by comparison ... there is none. With the available talents that have complimented the Rodgers and Hart creation, Seth MacFarlane's may as well be background filler during the dragging of dead bodies by a steamboat.  I won't be too critical (anymore). As I said the man can sing very well. I can admit 'Music Is Better Than Words' will become a collectable album, not because of the talent of the singer, but because he has a cartoon fan base that loves him.  This album is an average collection for a standard in music that won't easily be replaced.

Imagine being shocked and awed by a disc that just sneaks up on you and wows you off your chair. MacFarlane's a comic genius and now we need to add accomplished singer to that list of credits.

Joel McNeely's sprightly, overblown arrangements fit the creator of TV's \"Family Guy\" like a splendidly tailored suit.  MacFarlane's full and warm baritone makes this collection far more essential than just some run-of-the-mill celebrity vanity project (yes, Mr. Laurie, I'm talking about you).If you have a fondness for the great pop LP's of the mid-to-late 1950's (Sinatra, Como, Bennett, even Jackie Gleason's collections), this will make you very happy - and not in any post-modern ironic way.  MacFarlane MEANS this stuff!  After using the great Broadway and American songbooks as fodder for his tasteless - but hugely funny - animated empire, MacFarlane's sincere respect for the material and the era is obvious and very vivid on this disc/slab of MP3's.Later this winter, you can even play this while sitting next to the fire with a brandy - the way Seth obviously meant you to hear it.\n", "val": 0.05251796543598175}

His tone recalls Sinatra without being overly derivative, and his technique is marvellous--vibrato right on key.  Melody is king here, beautiful melodies, wonderfully sung.

I had the feeling this was just him playing around with his money, putting out something \"different\" for his fans so he can make even more money. But then you delve into the details, and you see that he played with his money out of his passion for the music, and for the genre. He used his fortune to allow him to live his dream, and for that, I applaud him. He really pulled out all the stops, not just from the microphone choice, but the fact that he was recording to tape as well. For the truest authenticity, this should have been a live to 2-track recording. That would've made the overall mix more difficult to pull off, but it shouldn't have been too hard to do, considering the tracks were cut live anyway.I also wonder what microphones were placed on the orchestra. That many mics wouldn't have been used back in the day. It results in a much more modern sounding record.Good to see he used ATR tape as well, even if they did use 2\" in the initial tracking phase, which would have not been used in that time period. For authenticity, they could have also gone with a much warmer, vintage tape. One that would have had a hard time getting hit at 0 VU, let alone +9 VU.I can only hope that the LP was mixed to tape as well, and mastered from the original mix master and not some digital transfer, or on a digitally delayed tape machine.Well, there's my rant.

Now, I'm happy to add, this new set of performances by the Alexander String Quartet proudly joins their ranks (the earlier Alexander set, while good, never quite achieved the same level of performance to my ears). The instruments produce a gorgeous tone, exquisitely captured by the recording. And what delightful interpretations, with dancelike melodies interspersed with mournful, haunting passages. I began in the middle with the op. 59 performances and found them fluid, forceful, sprightly, and lyrical as appropriate. Then I moved to the op. 18 selections and then to the latter quartets. Velvet tones brought out hushed, lyrical movements. Fleet, dancing rhythms were very accurate. Darker tones brought out the edgy quality that is sometimes lacking in more sedate renditions.  I \"connected\" with all the interpretations, which captured the various moods very well. This is very difficult for such a large body of diverse music, and is the main reason I place this new set alongside the few I mentioned at the beginning of the review.

{"text": "As anyone who has heard them knows, these guys are as good as it gets.  When Professor Greenberg recommended this set in his The Teaching Company course, \"The String Quartets of Beethoven\" (also outstanding by the way), I purchased them right away and expected great things.  Somehow, they are beyond even those expectations.  To start with, they use a quartet of extraordinary instruments on this particular set, the \"Ellen M. Egger Quartet of Instruments\" crafted by Francis Kuttner.  I'm not kidding you when I say that just listening to the sound of these instruments is worth the price of admission alone.  They sound that good.  There's a small booklet included in the set that describes and explains them so I won't go into that here.  The Alexander String Quartet does not own these instruments by the way, they're part of a \"trust\" of some kind and are loaned out for various purposes, this time for this recording.  And, how great they sound is perfectly obvious because the quality of sound in this series of recordings is likewise fabulous - FABULOUS!!  I would describe it as \"nearly realistic\". I don't say that lightly, I freely admit that I am a complete, total sound snob with a ridiculously expensive sound system, the components of which were slowly, painfully selected over many many years solely for the purpose of listening to just this kind of music.  The quality of the sound of these recordings is unusual.  Now, if the performances were merely good, that alone would be more than enough justification to buy these even if you already have several sets of Beethoven Quartets.  But the playing is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!  I can not imagine anyone who cares about this music not falling in love with these performances.  They have that \"inevitable\" quality that great performances have.  Everything fits together perfectly and effortlessly. Everything works; makes sense; is compelling, compelled-by-the-music compelling. The intonation is flawless.  The dynamics are breathtaking (and correct based on following along in the score - don't laugh, its far from always the case!).  And, best of all, one has that experience of insight that happens with the finest performances.  One hears things, or perhaps recognizes or understands things, never heard before.  I guess what's going on is something like this: great music is, of course, always something much greater than the sum of its parts.  Everything going on works together resulting in some kind of greater organic whole.  When the music is this great, the better it's performed, the more music emerges. That in itself is obvious but my point is, even after you're hearing everything being played, there can be even more music if its played still better. That might be a defining characteristic of classical music (jazz too).  A good example of this is Artur Schnabel or Richard Goode playing Beethoven and Schubert.  Maybe that can go on forever in the case of Beethoven's String Quartets I don't know but in any case, these guys get way WAY up there.  So between the rare combination of great performances and sound I can honestly say that out of many thousands of classical recordings, these are already among a small set of my very favorites.  If you're looking for a set of Beethoven String Quartets, this is it.  Even if you're not, buy them anyway because you will be delighted with them.  They are unbelievable.\n", "val": 0.013368786312639713}
{"text": "********* Update *********The way these recordings are listed is very confusing so I'll try to explain whats going on.The Alexander String Quartet released a set of Beethoven's complete string quartets some time ago (Late 90's early 2000s?) which is no longer available.  It was on Arte Nova's label and features a boat on the front.Just recently (2009) they totally re-recorded the entire String Quartet catalog of Beethoven on the Foghorn Classics label.  This newer version has the 4 members on the cover holding their instruments.For some reason Amazon is saying that this version won't be released until January 2010, even though it's already out.The confusing part is that I'm not sure which version Amazon is selling on the \"Buy Mp3\" page.  It appears they have a separate listing for both new and old versions, but when you try to buy the mp3s of either, they direct you to the same page.  I have a feeling these mp3s are from the old version, so buyers may want to err on the side of caution and just buy the physical box set.For anyone wondering, I bought the newer Foghorn set in Fall '09 from The Great Courses (The Teaching Company) for $50.For those REALLY into Beethoven, the teaching company also has a whole series of lectures on Beethoven's Quartets which features this newer version recording done by the Alexander String Quartet.

{"text": "I became an instant fan of O'Hearn when I bought \"Ancient Dreams\" as a teen in 1985. While I had initially thought that the private music label was the magic, as that New Age stable of artists collapsed into BMG I began following O'Hearn's work through his many label incarnations and realized the magic was O'Hearn himself. I have remained faithful to him in the 26yrs since that initial purchase, chiefly due to HIS remaining faithful to himself and his incredible ability to evoke emotion, pure and simple, through instrumental moods. I have had the privilege of corresponding with him on two occasions and found him to be genuine and gregarious. This new recording is a continuation of his vision of simple, direct mood, movement, and flow through instrumentation. It sounds like an effortless combination of his nostalgic \"Slow time\" (where he brought back his old analog equipment)and \"Glaciation\" which was more of a return to his works of the 1990s, like \"Indigo.\" There are also wonderful moments, as in \"Patterns\" where you almost feel you are listening to extra tracks that didn't make it to the \"Ancient Dreams\" recording. I have learned not to try and fit O'Hearn into any one category, as his work is really it's own dimension, only having vague reference here and there to the recordings of Harold Budd, or Later Brian Eno. But O'Hearn is always richer, and somehow seems to capture the truth of emotion through sound. \"Transitions\" is a solid O'Hearn offering and strongly representative of his general style and work ethic. buy it, you won't regret it.\n", "val": 0.03557927906513214}

{"text": "I went through a big new age kick in the 80s.  I have about 50 CDs that sit in a corner gathering dust.  There was a sameness to the music that at some point clicked off as being interesting.  Patrick O'Hearn is an artist whose music I began to listen to while that genre still had legs for me, but his music has never been placed in the corner and still has a pulse and energy that sets it apart.  Yes, there are beautiful sonic washes such as on the opener \"Reaching Land,\" but O'Hearn always creates a tensiveness with the percussion booms to keep it interesting.  \"Patterns\" seems like a quieter cousin of \"Tubular Bells\" with its building chimes.  \"Flight\" is a gorgeous track that brings to mind Jimmy Webb's gorgeous title track from his 1974 album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Land-s-End/dp/B000E112OI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Land's End</a>; O'Hearn gives us a similar sense of freedom in flight and the track marries a lovely melody to a great atmospheric arrangement.  O'Hearn opened with \"Reaching Land\" and then \"Flight\" and creates another wonderful track with \"Sea\" that might well be the soundtrack as one sits on the beach contemplating the vastness of the ocean and the smallness of man.  \"Transitions\" is a beautiful contemplative album filled with colors and emotions.  Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.03653132915496826}
{"text": "Patrick O'Hearn's music has always been like chicken soup for the soul to me. His beautiful, haunting melodies don't invoke momentary happiness or sadness, but instead a true feeling of being uplifted and inspired that stick with you, even after you've been done listening for a while.Mr. O'Hearn reminds me a little bit of Pixar... Each of his albums is amazing, and could almost be better than the last one if the last one could even be topped! There are never any albums I do not play often, nor are there ever any songs I skip. Same with his new masterpiece \"Transitions.\"Just like with any great album, you'll have to listen to it multiple times to really soak it all in. You'll love it on first listen, but the more you listen, the deeper the music gets. It's best to dedicate a good amount of time to listening this album without distractions. I truly enjoy it through headphones with no distractions, or turned up loud in my car stereo when driving!The title track, 'Reaching Land' is ... epic! It constantly builds up and ends with many beautiful sounds and melodies. 'Playground' lives up to it's name as a playful, uplifting song with great sounds used with the instruments and melody. 'Patterns' is an absolute gem. The notes all go together to create one complex melody that is haunting and wonderful. The ending track, 'Frontiers Revisited' is a masterpiece. I am not much of a musical person (just a listener) so please bear with my descriptions as best you can, hehe, and take my word for it... This is ambient music that will inspire you, that you will get addicted to, and that will make you think!!!I have a little rule that I don't listen to my favorite music as I drive to work because I find that when I listen to the music again, it reminds me of work!

{"text": "I've been a longtime fan of Patrick O'Hearn since at least the summer of 1998 when I began buying his CDs starting with his collection \"The Private Music of Patrick O'Hearn\". Since then, I have bought all of his albums starting with 1985's \"Ancient Dreams\" and everything released since then including \"Glaciation\".  While I enjoyed it a lot back in 2007, it left something to be desired for me. A four year wait ensued but it culminates in his 13th studio album (Not including soundtracks) entitled \"Transitions\" and it is MAGNIFICENT! I can't even begin to justify the sense of wonder at how O'Hearn has kept his magic and his Midas Touch intact for nearly 30 years, both with Missing Persons but also as a solo artist.  \"Transitions\" heralds a return to O'Hearn's roots as both a cellist, a pianist, and composer and blends all of his classic styles ranging from the electronic keyboards of his early albums, and the echoing pianos of post-Indigo works and yet creating a style all of it's own. A good four years after his previous release, that time frame shows in how different this one is from its predecessor. The opening track entitled \"Reaching Land\" harkens back to the days of 2001's \"So Flows The Current\" with the combination of echoing pianos echoing amidst a musical palette of watery keyboard arrangements both climaxing with ceramic percussion rhythms that only O'Hearn can create. It blends echoes of, \"The Stroll\" from \"Rivers Gonna Rise\" and echoes of \"Crossing the Divide\" from \"Metaphor\". A must-hear and the first opening notes convinced me this CD would be great. \"Courage\" is a holdover from 2007's \"Glaciation\" with a wintry, orchestral atmosphere, and similar atmosphere, like the evening sky in mid-winter. \"Playground\" is pure paradise with a mid-tempo rhythm built entirely from keyboards and a unique blend of joyfulness and suspense all blended in one. It is probably among his sunniest and happiest songs since \"Traveler's Rest\" and it is among my favorite songs on this entire album. I was instantly grabbed by the first keyboard notes coming out of my headphones and it is likely to become a favorite of his 21 century works. \"Restless\" is a marvelous blend of ominous atmospheres, dark-gray mood, heavy suspense, and electronic keyboard arrangements. The deep echoing ringing hum in the background gives the song even greater suspense along with it's strange pneumatic-air sound effect rhythm.  This particular song is like a natural sequel to \"Northwest Passage\" from a decade ago as it has a very similar, dark-gray cloud atmosphere. \"Patterns\" is a departure of sorts with a subtle mix of dazzling keyboard arrangements like droplets of water hitting a pond for every note heard culminating in an ambient blend of ambient trademark keyboard arrangements, and a unique atmosphere. Easily among the simplest songs on this CD. \"Well-Mannered\" is another departure from his normal styles and has heavier acoustic arrangements with a somber, melancholy tone reminiscent of a trip through the Appalachian Mountains on a rainy early spring evening. If you liked \"Narada Sampler `96\", you will love this song. \"Flight\" returns to his classic style with trademark echoing keyboard arrangements alongside echoing piano arrangements. I often imagine flying over the sea in winter or early spring on with clouds just below, with crepuscular rays visible from both above and below, casting shadows on the sea and landscape. Mentioning the sea, the eighth track ironically entitled \"Sea\" is pure ambience that rises and ebbs in very slow crescendos like watching slow-moving waves from high above. It is like a vastly improved version of \"Gradual Understanding\" with greater atmosphere. The feeling is very similar, albeit brighter and warmer. The final track \"Frontiers Revisited\" is exquisite beyond recognition, and is a very bittersweet blend of his sunny atmospheres of \"River's Gonna Rise\", the echoing haunting pianos of \"Metaphor\" and finally a new unique style of electric guitar arrangements. Beginning with beautiful echoing pianos and then a beautiful blend of bass-guitar sounds that are almost perfectly lifted from his \"River's Gonna Rise\" days but then blended with the beauty of \"So Flows The Current\" ambience, and a very bittersweet atmosphere. There's even an odd chord progression and again 0:53 to 1:05 where it seems to momentarily morph into a slight C-Minor before morphing right back to a C-Major. This is heard again at 2:06 to 2:14. It is a very interesting melodic pattern there. Finally culminating in a radiant blend of joyous and somber ambience starting at the 2:20, becoming more intense, and with marimba's towards the final minute, it finally echoes away with electric guitars bringing this album to a close. It is a magnificent way to close out this wonderful album and is my favorite closing track since \"Traveler's Rest\". In conclusion, \"Transitions\" has already become among the best New Age albums I've heard in many years and absolutely worth the wait. I've read in some sites criticizing O'Hearn's direction since his days at Private Music and Deep Cave records. Although I can respect their opinions, I have to respectfully disagree with them. Although I previously might have said that I wanted another \"Ancient Dreams\" or another \"Indigo\", the fact that \"Transitions\" is so wonderful and moving has convinced me that I'm open to just about any change of style that each album of his has. Another criticism I read was that it was `slow' once more. Now granted, there's no \"Downhill Racer\" nor \"Step\" or anything truly `danceable' in that context, but still, the sense of renewed magic and beautiful atmosphere, and soul present on here, makes \"Transitions\" a masterpiece. It's far too early to tell, as of this writing, where it will stand with me among his entire body of work, but for me, while not knocking on his 2003-07 works, it is safe to say that this is my favorite album of his since \"So Flows The Current\".\n", "val": 0.01564045250415802}
{"text": "I have been listening to Patrick's music since the `80's, and I can say that this release does NOT disappoint.  His opening track, `Reaching Land', which was previously released as a single, sets the tone for a wonderfully fresh if not slightly nostalgic new journey.  `Courage' is a fragile cinematic piece that could have been an Edward Shearmur piece, but there is something distantly disquieting that we eventually catch a glimpse of at the conclusion of the piece - awesome, Patrick!  `Playground' evokes an eerie innocence like a half-remembered childhood dream.  On `Restless', new and older familiar timbres blend with mechanical and metallic precision, while still infusing the woodiness of the fretless bass / cello lead, which creates a vista only O'Hearn listeners could recognize.  Crystalline `Patterns' offers a simple and lovely look at musical structure and complementary substance, which leads us to a similar piece - `Well-Mannered', which is a more classically-inspired version of the similar pattern structure, using more natural and signature O'Hearn tones.  Taking `Flight' is a fairly minimalistic O'Hearn piece, with the occasional burst of soaring textures.  My favorite piece of the album is `Sea', with is warm pads and strangely inverted rolling \"waves\" and subtly flanged swells; the addition of the sparse reverberant piano lead is just perfection, and evokes the huge vista of being on a sailboat at sunset when the sun is golden bronze and the water flows like molten copper.  The final piece `Frontiers Revisited' is a bit of a quirky piece with a clockwork-like lead-in that builds with piano, marimba, and is a nice nod to some of Patrick's other work that doesn't necessarily fit neatly into any \"ambient\" category.I wish Amazon would make lossless downloads available - this release would be an excellent candidate, as I find Patrick's music much more suited for headphone listening.  He's put this much effort into delivering such an excellent album, I want to make sure that I put some effort into listening to it properly.  Overall, I'm really enjoying Patrick's newest work, and I sincerely hope he can continue to make wonderful music like this for years to come!  4.5 StarsEDIT 2012-01-20: 'Frontiers Revisited' sounded familiar to me for a while, and now I know why -- can't believe I didn't \"get it\" previously!  This is a re-worked \"cover\" of 1980's Group 87 track of similar name, played by none other than Patrick O'Hearn / Pete Maunu / Mark Isham!  Prog / fusion, par excellence: my favorite track on this release is probably 'Magnificent Clockwork', but other tracks may appeal to more O'Hearn-focused fans (check out: 'The Bedouin' and 'While the City Sleeps'). If you dig Larry Fast's 'Synergy' releases, Level 42, Jean-Luc Ponty, you'll probably like Group 87's material as well. [Listen to 'Sublime Feline', and tell me that Level 42 didn't \"kang\" the whole first minute for 'The Sleepwalkers' on their 1987 chart-topping 'Running In The Family' release.  Funny that two of my all-time favorite artists are both bassists! -PKEDIT 2014-06-12.  Does someone here know of a place to purchase the CD of this release?  It's been out of print for over a year now, and I originally purchased the MP3 version (as indicated above).  I am DYING to get my hands on a copy of the CD to give it the proper treatment.  Post a comment here if you can help me out with locating a copy -- THANK YOU!!!!EDIT 2014-06-21. FINALLY I've located and purchased this CD via eBay.  Can't wait to give this a proper listen/rip...

Like most artists, his creativity bends and flexes over time, producing different sounds at different points in their career. Most musicians' output doesn't run in a straight line; there are twists and turns along the way. Tangerine Dream is a fine example of this. Some people won't listen to anything they produced after about 1980, and that's okay: to each their own. In Patrick O'Hearn's case, Glaciation sounds nothing like Trust. Interestingly enough, Transitions sounds, at least to me, like he's bending back toward his older sound. It felt familiar from the first play, whereas it took me a while to adjust to Glaciation.

{"text": "While Baba Yetu was written in 2005 for the video game, Civilization IV, I didn't hear it until May of this year when I was watching a video of the dancing waters at the recently-opened Burj Dubai. I found the song to be incredibly moving and with just a little Googling, found Christopher Tin's web site. I was delighted to learn he had an album in production and spent the entire summer eagerly anticipating its release.  As Jame DeLaHunt has stated, and with which I entirely agree; Chris didn't just meet my expectations, he far surpassed them.I highly recommend this work for anyone who appreciates orchestral and choral masterpieces.\n", "val": 0.032155830413103104}
{"text": "I'm one of the fans who discovered Christopher Tin through his \"Baba Yetu\", the Swahili-language hymn which opened the game \"Civilization IV\" and went on to dazzle in the \"Video Games Live\" concerts. I followed the progress of this album through his blog posts, and the preview clips he posted on his website.  But that led to high expectations: could he possibly meet them?He didn't just meet them -- he beat them, and left them in the dust!\"Baba Yetu\" is back, with more epic orchestration, and a thrilling chorus by the Soweto Gospel Choir. \"Mado Kara Mieru\" is a beautiful song in Japanese, about a cycle of seasons; this alludes to the cycle of human life within the song, and the overall cycle of day-night-dawn in the album.  \"Lux Aeterna\" (Latin) and the \"Hymn do Trjcy Swietej\" (Polish, featuring Frederica von Stade) plant a foot solidly in the classical tradition -- this is an album that welcomes lovers of the orchestral and operatic traditions. And so on through eight other tracks, each in a different language.Part of what makes the album so brilliant is the clever interweaving of themes from one track into another. Here are riffs from \"Lux Aeterna\" and \"Mado Kara Mieru\" woven into \"Baba Yetu\" and \"Hayom Kadosh\". There the opening chant and strings of \"Hayom Kadash\" recall starts of \"Baba Yetu\" and \"Caoineadh\". But what I think is most compelling is how the ending of the final track, \"Kia Hora Te Marino\", segues so seamlessly into the start of the first track, \"Baba Yetu\".  This makes the whole album a circle. You can start it at any point, and it will roll forever. In fact, I normally play the album starting from \"Sukla-Krsne\" (near the \"end\"), and put my player on repeat.I'm used to any work, even ones I really like, getting stale after one or two hearings. I have to put them away for some days or weeks before I'm ready to hear them again. Somehow, Tin has, with this album, written such a delicious confection that I can listen to it over and over for hours.  If it were possible to wear out a digital music file from repeated playing, my bits would would be in tatters. But fortunately, the files hold up just as well as Tin's music.\n", "val": 0.016779476776719093}

That alone would be enough to get me to buy the disk, but the other songs are also really good: a sampler from around the world.This is a particularly good album if you want to be inspired.

Twelve songs in twelve languages, the album progresses through life, death and rebirth, the final strains of Kia Hora Te Marino echoing the album's beginning, ready to start the cycle over again.I was drawn to the album because the first track, Baba Yetu was the opening credit music for Civilization IV for PC, the only game I let go through the credits each time I loaded it.  Each successive song (perhaps with the exception of Rassemblons-Nous, which I found a bit repetitive) draws you in so that you share the sorrow of Anonymous Four as they sing a Gaelic Keen and the reverence of the Polish Hymn Do Trojcy Swietej.The final three songs, in Farsi, Sanskrit, and Maori are jubilant and many times in the car I've just played those three over and over.I can't say strongly enough how amazing the entire album is, and is absolutely worth the price.

Each selection has its own unique charm and its a fun game to mix up the playlist and discover additional common themes between the songs. As a simple example, you can pretty much loop the first and last songs (Baba Yetu and Kia Hora) endlessly and they fit together at both ends. Other themes echo and re-echo throughout the album.My one complaint is that sometimes the arrangement is too \"Hollywood\" - like a movie soundtrack or even a commercial jingle. The songs themselves never fall into this trap, with top notch performances all around, but you'll sometimes find yourself thinking that with such an international cast of performers, why does the music sound so American? Despite this minor complaint, I still listen to this several times a year, so it's definitely worth the investment.\n", "val": 0.019141389057040215}

{"text": "Pick one of the many five star reviews for the standard CD version of 'Calling All Dawns', then amplify its recommendation ten-fold. Not only do you receive the same critically acclaimed CD score from Christopher Tin, but the real gem of this package is the DVD audio. What it lacks in special features it soars in audio fidelity - the DST 26/24 bit audio adds greater depth to an already outstanding score in full fledged 5.1 surround sound. The scores on the DVD are actually video files which contain the audio and lyrics in both the song's original language and an English translation casted simultaneously and in time with the vocals.I have listened to both the CD and the DVD version and the DVD version is far superior, provided you have a good 5.1 surround sound system to play it from.If you already have the original CD version and a decent 5.1 sound system, I would highly consider replacing it with the surround edition as the difference in depth and clarity is really noticeable. Most of the main vocals enter through the centre channel, and each channel has an even balance with none being overbearing. If you are considering the CD version, I would recommend stretching out for this version instead, as you are essentially getting two copies of his work (the DVD also contains the track in stereo recording) with the chance to taste it again in DTS.It also happens to be a very good audio demo disc, if you like this kind of music.Lose yourself in one of the best awe-inspiring music ever created with Tin's ultimate CD/DVD surround edition.

{"text": "Christopher Tin's album is a diverse, yet very well-formed piece of work - the pieces are grouped into parts depending on how moody, dark, epic or euphoric they are and what emotions they convey. The parts are named after temperate seasons and form a full circle - and the CD is actually easy to listen to over and over :) It even contains transitions between some songs. There are some major standouts as well; I particularly like Mado Kara Mieru, Hamsafar and Sukla-Krsne. Also, I don't usually listen to world music, but the flavours of different cultures are very nice.The only gripe I have with the album is the quality of the mixdown/mastering - it is good, but not outstanding, and it seems to be much better on Baba Yetu than the rest of the tracks. It may be, however, just because I come from an electronic music background and my ear might be too accustomed to overcompressed music.Overall, a delightful album - you do need an excuse not to get it.\n", "val": 0.011867877095937729}

Oh, man -- where to begin? The performances are fabulous, and the all-star international cast of artists is absolutely amazing. Where else are you going to hear Japanese pop stars next to giants of the opera world? The extensive use of interlocking motifs throughout the disc is refreshing and intriguing, and always keeps me listening for more musical details. The brilliant song-cycle concept and the sheer musicality of the various languages used are amazing.But if I had to name just one thing, it's that Tin has taken elements of musical traditions from all over the world and has seamlessly fused them together into a Western/classical framework. The result is a musical composition that sounds simultaneously exotic and familiar.And you don't need to have a background in classical music to appreciate Tin's work. People keep stopping by my desk and asking what I'm listening to. Probably the most common comment I get on this is \"Can we hear that international music thing again?\"You won't be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.03605583310127258}
{"text": "This a great album with a really cool concept. The theme is humanity, diversity and how we're all in the same boat on the same planet facing the same cycle of life and death.Each of the 12 tracks are in different languages, drawing on the culture, literature and religious texts of many different societies. In a particularly bold stroke, English was excluded from the album; it gives more space for other cultures, especially non-Western ones, to breathe.Especially inspiring is the Persian-language piece featuring Iranian singer Sussan Deyhim; it just soars and summons images of the young supporters of Mir Hossein Musavi during the June election riots.There's a few weak spots, the Chinese track is repetitive and makes use of only a couple of sentences, which is unfortunate given China's outsized role in the world economy and its huge population.But overall, there is nothing else like this album and no one else like Christopher Tin who can remind us of the ties we share and are all too quick to forget.\n", "val": 0.011200963519513607}

There was nothing of the grating cacophony of the concert venue in the polished track.Naturally, when I heard that Christopher Tin was planning an album, I was intrigued and very excited. I pre-ordered the album off of his website and was absolutely delighted with the album.Calling All Dawns consists of twelve tracks in twelve languages, each moving seamlessly into the other, Chinese into Portuguese, Hebrew into Farsi. An amalgam of fado with gospel and opera. A song cycle of day, night, and dawn. Woven into the notes are an ardent fascination with other cultures and a deep respect for the world as a whole.

It is comprised of twelve songs, each in a different language, all of which are connected through themes of life, death, and rebirth, and results in an utter masterpiece. The songs flow perfectly into one another, and even incorporate some of the same bits of music, reinforcing the album's idea that everything is cyclical, that everything is connected.Even without the rest of the CD to back them up, each of the songs is beautifully orchestrated, and (even though I have no idea what they are saying) perfectly sung.

The album.  The only thing that was disappointing to me about this one was that for all my perseverance, I didn't get signed disc number one.Listening to it for the first time took me on a fantastic journey through all that is surreal, and all that is sound.  It was moving, mesmerizing, simple and yet complex.  It raised the hairs on my arms a few times, I must admit, and when it was over, it left me wanting more.  And if you're saying to yourself, this sounds like someone who has something to gain from Christopher's ultimate (and clearly imminent) success, you'd be right.  And I would benefit from it.But so would you.I'm just a fan.  Perhaps not an ordinary one, no... but just a fan.  And although I might not benefit in a financial way from his success, I can clearly see the path between more of his music, and more of my satisfaction.Plus, if I ever get to make a feature film of my own, I'd like to be able to hire Christopher to score it for me.As for the CD, you should just get one, already.

One of the most interesting coincidences of the year was to learn that an acquaintance of mine was also familiar with the song through her work as a Catholic youth minister; the song has appeal in that space as a meditative piece.The second track, Mado Kara Mieru, is a lot of fun to blast out of my car stereo in the morning on the way to work.Like these two songs, the rest of Tin's ablum beautifully blends orchestra and vocals together in ways that are at times subtle, at times powerful, and frequently moving. Some themes are repeated across songs, which ties elements together in interesting ways. The use of non-English language appeals to me personally because I cannot listen to music with vocals in my native tongue and think clearly; too much brain power is used in deciphering the lyrics. On the other hand, I'll probably have to sit down with the liner notes to fully appreciate some of the pieces.I rarely hand out five-star ratings, and this album certainly isn't perfect. But I can't deny that it was my most listened-to piece of musical work in 2009.

{"text": "I am yet another fan who started following Christopher Tin after playing Civilization IV. I say \"playing\", but the title screen theme \"Baba Yetu\" made it difficult to actually start the game, knowing the song would have to end. Eventually I researched the song, and found Tin's website with a downloadable track of it, and played it nonstop for months.I did not know what to expect from Calling All Dawns. \"Baba Yetu\" was so well done that I did not know if Tin was another one-hit wonder, or if he would be the next genius composer of this generation. But, in anticipation I preordered. To put a long story short, once I listened to it, I bought albums for several friends too.Called a \"song cycle\", you should really consider it a soundtrack, but a soundtrack to no movie or game. It's really a soundtrack to our world, the heartbeat of civilization itself. Spanning all languages and styles, it somehow unifies it all into a common theme of life and death, day and night, all while interspersing religious themes that are treated with dignity and respect. It's emotional, and inspired, and like taking a journey through song.I'm not really a fan of \"World Music\" in general. But I like good music and well-composed music, and Calling All Dawns does not disappoint! These songs are brilliant in their own right, which just mirrors the brilliance of the composer. Christopher Tin is truly an innovator, and someone to watch for the next few decades.

I read that her last album was recorded in studios in the US and Europe!  Check out the recent Nicki Minaj song \"Fly\" which heavily features Rihanna.  The video is weird and I had to watch it 6 or more times before I warmed up to it.  I like the new single \"We found love\" but it is overly repetitive and the video has enough 80's style sex, drugs, and rock and roll to be a soft core porn.\n", "val": 0.004969970788806677}

That unfortunately wasn't a very strong record, yet she is about to try it again later this year with Loud, her 5th album. Her debut single from that album, Only Girl (In The World) isn't a driven song, in fact it feels less than strong. She tries to bring out more of an electronica sound to her voice, but the feeling of the song, doesn't score a home run. I really wasn't very impressed with the song, in fact it felt like the wind didn't even take my breath away. I really think Rihanna should take her time, rather than rushing her music out there.

The `look at me, I'm edgy and need attention' antics of songs like \"Hard\", \"S&M\", and \"Rude Boy\" just undermine a voice that, under the right circumstances with the right lyrics and music, can be quite good (such as \"Umbrella\" or \"Love the Way You Lie\").  This latest release by her, \"Cheers (Drink to that)\" doesn't even have the negative attention grabbing aspects of those other songs.  It's just really dull and boring.  It uses the \"yeah a yeah\" sample from Avril Lavigne's \"I'm With You\" and plays it over a really droning beat along with Rihanna's disinterested vocals.  In addition, the lyrics tap into such clich&eacute;d `hip' phrases such as `hella good'.  Then it has this really odd interlude where the music cuts out and it sounds like a group of drunks at a bar trying to sing along to the lyrics.  All in all, this is a very forgettable song.  However, given RiRi's fan base, it will still probably make some noise on the charts.\n", "val": 3.3570409868843853e-05}

{"text": "On first listen, this album might be hard to understand, to listen to and to accept, its quite different from their previous albums, but its nonetheless a Bombay Bicycle Club album through and through. Its just an evolution, one that contains all the great parts that their previous albums imparted.1: How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep; A great opening track with jangling guitars a little electronic beep and bop give this album a fresh driving beat accompanied by Suren de Saram's great drum beat, it really is a great song to wake up to and get moving.2: Bad Timing: This starts out a little melancholy, kind of reminds me of the band Ultra in its structure. \"with all your powers I am pushing back\", the song sings of loss and the inability to stop it happening, slightly dour for the second track, but hey I like it dour, so another great track.3: Your Eyes: Picks up the mood and offers a slightly more aggressive mood than the other songs so far, the great thing about this track are all the little instruments they use, here and there, just make it very interesting to pick through. I just love the way the song ends...4: Lights Out, Words Gone: Ah man the beginning of this song is delicious, \"my heart is breaking like you heard\", great structure, reminds me a little of ska. I believe its Lucy Rose singing with them, great haunting song.5: Take the Right One: Hits its stride straight away, very reminiscent of late 80's early nineties Seattle movement, but brought up to date.6: Shuffle: Oh boy this song is just stupendous (sorry had to use that word) \"You gave to me, All I know, I will stay here, I will not go\" doesn't that say it all, Lucy Rose also sings on this song as well, its just an extremely uplifting song, and makes you want to bounce all over. \"Once you get the feel of it, It wants you back for more\"7: Beggers: Possibly one of my favourite songs on the album, it starts soft album, folksy, but then shoves that aside for a driving forceful song, the drums, lyrics, bass are all wonderful \"so carefully planned, each word you have spoken\"8: Leave It: \"Dont you go leave me now, come see what you've done\" A good song about leaving or being left, seems to be a theme across the album.9: Fracture: Possibly my least favourite song, thats not to say its bad, just that each album has to have one :) Reminds me of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel10: What You Want: I like the fact that by the 10th song on an album that is still good, great even, that's the magic of this album, \"You tease this love\", \"watcha want, watcha want, anything you want\" Seems to be an song of someone taking advantage of another, has a great melody, and awesome drum line, great use of song structure to bring the feeling of helplessness across.11: Favorite Day: \"strange dream\" little fairies sing, well that's what it sounds like anyway. The song is interspersed with a baroque sounding piano. A really good penultimate song. \"Don't stop, till you feel it all\" Shouldn't everyone live their lives to that lyric.12: Still: \"Simple promises you said you'd never break, but now you have\" A very haunting song, i'll leave you guys to see what its all about, but its something that stays with you for a long time, wonderful way to end a song. The piano sounded like the one U2 used on October, it makes you think of a cold autumn day just as winter is about to fall.So in closing this entire album from start to finish is just a wonderful journey through life and its struggles but also its joys and loves. Thankfully its an album that simply gets better and better with every single listen.\"My lips they stay perfectly still\"\n", "val": 0.013901199214160442}

The band really is the real thing; their songs are original, the sound is varied and inventive, even fearless; and enrgetic and alive.

{"text": "Bombay Bicycle Club are the latest indie rock band from England. They were initially started by three of the four members while they were still in high school. After recruiting the fourth member at a funeral, they went off to to play numerous gigs around London. They were entered into a network competition that was sponsored by Virgin Mobile where they would get the chance to perform at a huge live venue. After they won the contest, they were given the opening slot at the V Festival. A few years late into their career, they released a couple of well recieved EP's and signed with Island Records to release their informal debut. 2009 saw the issue of \"I Had The Blues, But I Shook Them Loose\"- a song named after a line on A Tribe Called Quest's \"People Instinctive Travels And The Paths Of Rhythm\". The following year saw the release of their sophomore effort- the stripped down \"Flaws\". In 2011, they issued their third album- and first American release under A&M/Octone Records- the most accomplished outing \"A Different Kind Of Fix\".On this new album, they reunite with the producer of their first album Jim Abbiss (Best known for his work with Arctic Monkeys, Adele and the Sneaker Pimps). This new project sounds like a hybrid of early Radiohead with a little Joy Division thrown in. They start the album off with \"How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep\"- a song that originally appeared on the deluxe edition to the soundtrack of \"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse\". The channel the sound of early new wave on \"Bad Timing\" while also delivering the uptempo \"Your Eyes\". They get vocal assistance from fellow British singer Lucy Rose on the radio accessible romance themed \"Lights Out, Worlds Gone\", the catchy \"Leave It\" and the ballad \"Favourite Day\". On the first single \"Shuffle\", they employ an unusually quirky distorted piano riff and close the album with the stripped down and melodic \"Still\". Overall, Bombay Bicycle Club's \"A Different Kind Of Fix\" is a great recording from this quartet and should be the album to break them through to the American market. Though this record is all over the place stylistically, there's no shortage of great songs on here. It's the kind of album that once it's heard, it can never be put down.\n", "val": 0.003818400902673602}
{"text": "This record has the goods. The production and song writing are simply top notch. The melodies are lovely and catchy without being cliche. The lyrics resonate with the music while lingering in your head long after the tune ends. Jack Steadman's vocals effortlessly flow while exhibiting impressive range and tone - at times breathy, other times soft, occasionally heavy, yet never abrupt or out of place. The vocal harmonization provides depth and is evidence of stellar production. There are many melodies and rhythms frequently coming in and out during various sections of many of the songs, but they never feel crowded - each note is crisp and recognizable. The record sounds fantastic with a pair of quality headphones, yet doesn't sound muddy when turned up even on low-end speakers. As for the individual tunes themselves, Luke's review below is pretty spot on. The record has it all - a few catchy pop singles, slow grooves, ballads, and a rocker or two. Simply put, this is a fantastic record by talented and promising musicians in a top quality recording studio with seasoned sound engineers.

Their newest collection of songs is almost a compromise for Jack Steadman (lead vocals, guitar), Jamie MacColl (guitar), Ed Nash (bass) and Suren de Saram (drums)--it combines the standard electric feel of their first album with the softer, almost more sentimental tone of their second. Songs like How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep and Lights Out, Words Gone will catch you from the first listen, and others like Beggars and Your Eyes take a little more time to chew over, but will rapidly become your favorites.This album is unlike anything I've ever heard.

I felt so much better afterward.BACK TO THE SONG:  I have heard earlier acoustic arrangements of this song live in Amy's concerts, but the production here is big and epic, with gorgeous background vocals.  (When I heard that Vince was going to do the song \"big,\" I just couldn't hear it in my head.  But as always, he delivered a beautifully produced track that has very gentle, vulnerable moments, followed by well-earned displays of theater and emotion...tasteful, not over-the-top, but BIG, nonetheless.)I daresay, this song, in this configuration of theme and style has not been done before.  I love the fact that the dying narrator is full of acceptance and calm wisdom.  Yet, he is also WONDERFULLY DEFIANT!  He's saying to his loved-ones, to his doctors:  I realize my time on earth is winding down...the world is telling me that I'm looking into the dark abyss, facing extinction.  But I'm here, right now, facing the yawning nothingness of death and, well, I'm giving death \"the finger.\"  I'm not pious or doctrinaire, but I have faith.  I have no idea what the other side is going to look like, but I believe it's going to be soaked with mercy, grace and a pure and healing light.So yeah, \"Threaten Me with Heaven\" is a riposte to those who believe that death is the end.  Mankind's greatest fear is death.  This narrator, in plain-speak, says \"bring it on.\"  He acknowledges he'd happily accept a miracle (a temporary reprieve), but he has accepted his ultimate fate.Every person who has ever walked the earth or ever will, dies.  This narrator--never grandiose or martyr-like--accepts that simple, but hard-to-swallow truth with courage and grace.  Part of the song's poignancy rests in the fact that the song recounts a conversation between a dying man and someone who loves him.  There is no reason to doubt the narrator's bold conviction regarding eternity...but does he have doubts?  Is he, by saying the mantra \"threaten me with heaven\" over and over, trying to convince himself?  Is his bravery mainly for the person with tears on his face, who so fears that soon the man will be gone?These lyrics are genius because all of the options above--and more--can all be true.  The dying man is human; he is not God.  His speaking these brave and consoling words might just be the closest he has ever come to holiness...maybe he's awaiting execution on death row.  Maybe he has lived an exemplary life and is dying of old age at 103.  This song will find you where you are...it will cast the narrator and his loved one in the situation you most relate to and need.Consider the difficulty of writing a song of such humility...such defiance...such authority...such bemused surrender to all those \"theys\" who tell him he is dying...and the elasticity to allow the narrator to be, well, anybody on his death bed.  Is this a moment of clarity...or the culmination of a life of unwavering faith?Vince Gill has written many beautiful songs about the deaths of loved ones.  \"Go Rest High...\" is a mainstay at funerals across America.But \"Threaten Me with Heaven\" may eclipse \"Go Rest High\" as the essential funeral song.  I have never heard a song that faces death so fearlessly, while offering such comfort to both the dying person and the loved ones left behind.This song should be a classic.  It deserves serious attention at country and adult contemporary radio stations.  This song should be a hit and should compete for Country Song of the Year...maybe Gospel Song of the Year as well.  I have a gut feeling that this will be a new chapter of success for Vinnie.Regardless of whether this song finds commercial success, it moved me deeply enough to write this lengthy reflection/review (I think my second review in several years) and it has changed me.  It goes into my small, personal pantheon of pivotal moments in popular music.BOTTOM LINE:  DOWNLOAD THE SINGLE AND GATHER THE KLEENEX.  GORGEOUS.  SENTIMENT IS EARNED.\n", "val": 0.012791755609214306}
{"text": "I have been waiting 5 years for a new album from Vince Gill.  His last album release of new material was the amazing four disc album \"These Days\"&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/These-Days-Dig-Slip/dp/B000HKDEN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">These Days (Dig) (Slip)</a>&nbsp;from 2006.  \"Threaten Me With Heaven\" is the debut single from his upcoming album, \"Guitar Slinger,\" which is scheduled to be released on October 25, 2011.I may be biased, because I would probably listen to Vince Gill sing the phone book, but I love this song!There is no doubt from the opening chord that this is a Vince Gill song.  The first, oh, 20 times I listened to this song, I did not know the background to it, but it brought tears to my eyes.  After reading Vince Gill's description of the background to the song on his own website, I am even more affected by this beautiful, heartrending song.  Mr. Gill created this song with his wife, Amy Grant, and Dillon O'Brian and Will Owsley.  Since the song was recorded, Mr. Owsley, who played guitar and sang on the track and is described by Vince Gill as \"my guitar-playing buddy,\" took his own life.  This adds to the poignancy and sadness of the song for me.  At the same time though, the song gives me hope and some comfort.  Once you listen to the song, I think you may feel the same way.Besides the lyrics and the back story of the song, the vocals and musicianship displayed on as great as any of Mr. Gill's other songs.This song is as heartbreaking and at the same time uplifting as some of Mr. Gill's other songs that have touched on the subject of death and the lost of a loved one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Go-Rest-High-On-That-Mountain/dp/B000W239UY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Go Rest High On That Mountain</a>&nbsp;- He started to write this after the death of country star, Keith Whitley, but never finished it until the death of his older brother Bob Gill.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hey-God/dp/B000W273AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hey God</a>&nbsp;- The song Vince Gill wrote for his friend, the pro-golfer, Payne Stewart.

In the meantime, Vince Gill has worked on other artists' recordings and albums such as:Playing lead guitar on two new songs for Alice Cooper.[ASIN:B002HEOLK2 Tennessee Line]] The track \"Tennessee Line\" on Daughtry's 2009 album, \"Leave This Town.\"&nbsp;The track \"Tennessee Line\" on Daughtry's 2009 album, \"Leave This Town.\"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Can-You-Give-Me-A-Drink-Feat-Vince-Gill/dp/B004X0XTEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Can You Give Me A Drink?

A little bittersweet to listen to, because it reminds me of the days seeing Jimmy playing small venues and having as much fun, as we, the audience, did. Those were days when Jimmy would be putting on one great show after another and every show was different based on audience interaction and participation. Now that Jimmy is a \"brand\", the shows are generic and dull compared to the old days. I'll never forget Jimmy's acoustic set in a theatre on Broadway when the late, great Ed Bradley came on stage, tossing boxes of pizzas out to the crowd and singing \"Sixty Minute Man\". The place went wild. Now, Buffett \"Inc\" plays soldout mega-stadiums. Can't blame the guy for making the big bucks when he struggled for so many years. But, man, to see and hear Jimmy live, back in the day, that was something special. This album gives you a small taste of that and is rock solid on song selection from the early years. I'm sure \"critics\" will not agree with me, but I think this is one of the best live albums ever released.

I'm not a fan of any of Buffett's other live albums, because he comes across to me like he's just punching a clock trying to get through another show. Not the case here. This is Buffett genuinely having a blast playing his music and telling stories to a raucous crowd that just eats it up!Almost all of his best known songs are here, along with some lesser known great tunes. All of them are played with enthusiasm, which is why I say this is THE Buffett album to have. Buffett was a great songwriter in his early days, but often the studio versions of those songs just came across flat, with no emotion or enthusiasm behind them. In addition to Buffett's enthusiasm, the fabulous Coral Reefer Band is absolutely outstanding here in this live setting.This live album was culled from live shows in August of 1978 at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, GA and the Maurice Gusman Cultural Center in Miami, FL. While all live albums contain cuts and edits, this one included, you'd have to really be paying attention here to notice. The entire album flows well and comes across as one amazing live show from start to finish. The album is called \"You Had To Be There.\" Put it on and you feel like you ARE there.I have worn out a cassette and two CD copies of this album since the early 90s, and have now purchased an MP3 copy.

{"text": "I've been a RSB fan for a few years, and I'm so glad their music will reach a wider audience now that they're signed.  This album is great.  It's worshipful, honest, beautiful, earthy, and rockin'.  Robbie's got an incredible voice, and it's about time churches pick up on honest songs like this.  The songs are about God, life, history, roots, community, grace, and hope.  Musically, it's laid back acoustic rock similar to Travis, with some Texas influence.  Ryan, the bass player is one of the most creative and talented players you'll ever hear.  Do yourself a favor and get this CD.

Their lyrics are crystal clear on where they stand, yet approachable and intelligent all at the same time.Robbie sings like a weird hybrid of Bryan Adams and Derek Webb, with a whispery delivery.

{"text": "I heard their song \"Better Days\" and thought it was pretty decent.  I had no idea who they were -- and really still don't.  But I got a really good deal on the CD and I have to say, I am delightfully surprised.  Their music isn't anything new, but I like it.  It's pretty mellow, it has a really good sound, and I like the lyrics.The only real complaint -- or perhaps reservation is a better word -- is that the songs tend to blur together; there isn't a whole lot of variation.  One of the things I look for in any album is a progression of the music.  In essence, the songs at the beginning progress into a different mood by the end of the album.  There isn't that with this album.  I mean, I like all of the songs, but their tone and tempo could probably have a little bit better range to them.But all in all, I'd say it's worth a listen (I'm listening to it right now : - )- The Wildman -\n", "val": 0.021294167265295982}

{"text": "This is a very good Vivaldi set and an excellent bargain, particularly at the introductory price of $1.99. The recordings are overwhelmingly by Budapest Strings, a well-respected Hungarian ensemble I saw in concert several times, always with great pleasure, when I used to live in Budapest.Budapest Strings has recorded quite a bit of Vivaldi on the Naxos, Capriccio and LaserLight labels. While I can't be 100% sure, I suspect much of this material may be those same recordings released here under some kind of licensing arrangement. The quality of the performances are all very good to excellent.The set starts out with the ubiquitous \"The Four Seasons\", which I always think I've heard too many versions of already. But this one stood out for me as being particularly lively and engaging. I'm still a little tired of The Four Seasons, which seems to be obligatory fare almost any collection of classical music that has the number \"99\" in the title, but this is quite a good performance. The other performances are of similar high quality. I particularly enjoyed the slow, tragic Sinfonia in B minor \"Al Sancto Sepolcro\" -- RV 169.One of the positives on the set is that it includes, with very few exceptions, complete works rather than excerpts.A negative, however, is the lazy track listing, which has been a frequent issue on previous collections from Cobra Entertainment as well. Vivaldi's works are generally identified by their \"RV\" (Ryom-Verzeichnis) catalog number. This is important since Vivaldi had a lot of different concertos for a lot of different instruments in his total 813 cataloged works, and to keep them straight the RV number is very handy. It would be nice if it had been included for all the works here rather than on just selected works.Total download size for 4 hours and 20 minutes of music is 433 MB, and the bitrates are variable, averaging a respectable 210-237 kbps.This is a good set of serious Vivaldi recordings. Warmly recommended.\n", "val": 0.020944377407431602}

The strings are very, very beautiful. Many performances of the 1812 use cannons and carillon in the finale; this one does not. Thundering bass drums replace the cannons, and orchestral bells replace the carillon.

{"text": "Bastion, released on Steam and Xbox Live Arcade ($15 USD on XBLA), is an amazing video game.  While the artwork, music and gameplay all stand up very well on their own, the game's truly unique feature, reactive narration, ties it all together.  The end result is a game that truly draws you into its compelling storyline and instantly connects you with its unforgettable characters.Of course, this review is about the soundtrack.  You get a glimpse of the narrator's charming voice and sense of style in the first track, \"Get Used To It\", and this makes a nice prelude to Bastion's excellent background music.  The music ranges from simple, innocuous themes like \"Twisted Streets\", which accompanies you as you first begin to explore your shattered world, to the driving beat of the India-inspired \"Terminal March\", punctuating most of the fights with the game's bosses.Each theme has a place, even if you've never seen or played the game.  Feel the ground crumbling away beneath your feet in \"Percy's Escape\".  Get lost in the Wild Unknown with themes like \"Brusher Patrol\" and \"Slinger's Song\".  Or be touched by Zulf's sadness in \"Mother, I'm Here\" and the quiet introspection of the Ura in \"Pale Watchers\".  There really is something for everyone in this album.If you have an Xbox 360 or a Steam account and have not played Bastion, you owe it to yourself to experience everything this fine game has to offer.  And in my opinion, this soundtrack is worth the $15 that Supergiant Games is asking for the entire game.\n", "val": 0.03862926736474037}

Included with the score are four original songs (Build That Wall; Mother I'm Home; Setting Sail, Coming Home; The Pantheon), sung by some talented singers.

The gameplay was the second thing.  And lastly, the colorful visuals topped everything off.A lot of the tracks has a western style theme to it, which fits quite well to how the game and its story is narrated.  Every time I hear \"Slinger's Song,\" it tickles my funny bone because it felt it was done for a classic western film.  And after playing through the game, it finished off with the song \"Setting Sail, Coming Home\" which really fits the sequence perfectly.  It felt like an ending theme all the way through and the mixing of both vocals is fantastic.Video game music has always been a tricky thing.  Very rarely does a soundtrack really made the game that much better and very rarely does a soundtrack stand out for being so great to listen to.  The game should have included the soundtrack with the game rather than as a separate add-on.  But then again, the soundtrack can also be purchased directly from them if you want the FLAC version instead of lossy mp3s.Verdict: Oh my GOD just get it already!\n", "val": 0.01477032620459795}
{"text": "I am not normally the kind of person that buys music, let alone video game soundtracks.  This has been the case for me since the late 90's.  But sometimes, you'll just come across something that stops you dead in your tracks and captivates you.  Bastion is one of those games.  Bastion has one of those stories. Bastion has one of those soundtracks.If you haven't played the game (buy it!), the feel of the soundtrack is a kind of a funky industrial western tinged trip hop.  Despite the overarching western themes, Darren Korb successfully utilizes a wide variety of synthesized exotic instruments, such as the berimbau and sitar, to paint the locales of Bastion.  The atmospheric album progresses through the tracks, themes and pacing like the game's story. It is, dare I say, almost akin to OK Computer in the sense that it is an album that should be played from start to finish.  The album itself is a story that like the Bastion, you want to keep revisiting.This actually costs a buck less than purchasing through Steam at the time of writing this.  If you liked the game and loved the soundtrack, buy this and support the studio and composer!  Maybe we'll see more from them.  Maybe we won't.

{"text": "Bastion is a great and stylish adventure game recently released on Xbox Live Arcade and Steam by Supergiant Games. Not only does it have amazing visuals but it has an amazing soundtrack as well. Darren Korb, the \"one man band\" from Supergiant Games, composed this incredible album for Bastion. He describes the soundtrack as being a \"acoustic frontier trip-hop\", and I can't think of a better description.  You'll notice from the start with \"Get Used to It\", that there is a narrator. Although he has an important role in the game, he doesn't show up much in the album. To be clear I'm not a big fan of narrated tracks on albums, but it's not long and it is a good intro for what's to come. Once you the next track plays, \"A Proper Story\", you'll understand what Darren Korb meant in his discription. Almost all the songs have this feel to it and never do I feel like I'm listening to the same song over and over again, which happens quite a lot in video game soundtracks.  With tracks like, \"Bynn the Breaker\" & \"Terminal March\", they make you want to turn up your stereo just because of the heavy bass alone. Seriously, if you have a sub you will enjoy this album even more. You'll also notice a hint of Arabian like music from \"Terminal March\" and some Spanish tunes in \"From Warf to Wilds\". It's also obvious when listening to \"Percy's Escape\" that Darren Korb knows his way around with percussion and strings.  When hearing \"Build That Wall (Zia's Theme)\" & \"Mother, I'm Here (Zulf's Theme)\", the album takes a turn by slowing down and dropping the trip-hop to allow some vocals. Towards the end of the album, the two songs make a reprise together in \"Setting Sail, Coming Home (End Theme)\". A nice touch if you ask me.  Even if you're not a gamer the soundtrack to Bastion is great by itself. This is the first album I've heard from Darren Korb and I'm quite impressed. I will be keeping an eye on his future career, as should you.[...]\n", "val": 0.021882303059101105}

However, I must say this song will have you drifting away to a place only few things can get you. It's what I would call meaningless, lack of content, and without a message. On the other hand, the arrangements are downright brilliant while the vocals have you drifting away in the abyss. Overall, the song is a stroke of generous, and will have you playing it over, and over, and over.Well done Guetta.....keep the hits comingYou now have a new fan.Mike\n", "val": 0.0062639000825583935}

{"text": "Yes the song has been out a while, (2012?). But the song still appears on the Billboard charts, still played at clubs, still on the radio. The year end charts rate it highly, and was a worldwide hit. At about the same time, Sia was also top 10 with Flo Rida's \"Wild One\". She has a huge voice, very unique and powerful. If you listen to some of her Zero 7 stuff, you would say WOW she let loose!Personally, I have been listening to Trance/Electronic/Club/House etc since the nineties and last year finally it hit the top 10 here regularly. David Guetta is one reason, with his many collaborations. This song just hit the mark, it built up slowly, people started to listen, hit top 10 and stayed in the top 100 for a VERY long time.The song is one of my all time favorites, just plain inspirational. The beat is tremendous, the words mean something, the vocals are plain spectacular. A true anthem. I usually double play it with iO's \"Rapture\" and Zedd's \"Clarity\". Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.030359838157892227}

{"text": "Are we really at the point now where we have songs that sample songs that sample other songs...?!! Why... good God, look at that: YES, WE ARE. That's EXACTLY where we are; this is EXACTLY what we've come to. We've finally arrived at the audio jigsaw-puzzle as the airplay unit of choice. Eventually, of course (and you mark my words on this) somebody will come along and sample this unit from Flo Rida, and we'll then have a song which samples a song which samples a song which samples a song.Bruh....Now that I've said all that, let me go ahead here and note how well this record works: I LOVE the end result here -- although I do gotta admit that when I first heard LEVELS from Avicii, my first thought was NOT, \"...you know, what this thing really needs is more Flo Rida in it!\" Still, what Flo Rida does here with Avicii's work is all kinds of commercial -- and I definitely hope that Avicii gets a bit of real and true organic (commercial) growth w/re his audience from this. Too, I am quite pleased that Etta gets highlighted in what will almost certainly become a Top 5 SKU at retail (assuming this incredibly radio-friendly unit gets the push it deserves from the label, literally millions of new eardrums will become exposed to Etta's fine voice in what ought to be an absolute orgy of airplay). The final result here is an absolute eargasm.Which really brings me to my point, here -- and YES, I do have one: Flo Rida, if you read these things, I'd like to suggest something for your live show... and it's this: before you break into Good Feeling, take a moment and play a short clip from Etta and let your audience know who she was -- and IS. She DESERVES that consideration -- and let's be fair here, okay? You OWE her, and you owe her a LOT. Take a moment during your live show, man... show a short video clip of Etta... and intro Miss Peaches to a whole new generation of listeners. Partly because it would simply be a hella cool thing to do -- but mostly because she's EARNED IT.Thanks, man.This is actually some very good work, but hey... you know, give Etta her props.I just kinda wanted to say that.4 stars... mostly because I just can't give 5 stars to something that samples a sample of a sample -- even if it IS all kinds of big-time awesome.\n", "val": 0.00643455283716321}

Problem fixed,thanks amazon.) Also The Fatty is one of the funniest bits that I ever heard.\n", "val": 0.030067013576626778}
{"text": "When I heard that Joe DeRosa was coming out with a new album, not even a year after the phenomenal The Depression Album was released, I was - for lack of a better word - stoked.Not because DeRosa was the first comedian ever written about for this blog (although the sentimental part of me admits that may have been a small part of it), but because this guy cracks me up. He's hilarious, and to be given another album (a full hour!) of brand new material so soon after his last release is a more-than-generous gift from the comedy heavens.With Return Of The Son Of Depression Auction, DeRosa is back in all of his Can-You-Friggin-Believe-This glory and it's a welcome return to the comedian who is funniest when he finds himself amid a whirl of unfathomable idiocy that can sometimes be this world we live in. And like his last album, DeRosa is just as willing to call BS on himself as he is those around him. With track titles like \"I've Never Been In Shape\" and \"A Pussy, That's Me,\" DeRosa makes it clear that none of us - not even he - are going to make it out unscathed.And, if you happen to be a homeless guy on the subway with DeRosa while he chokes on KFC...well...let's just say it's going to be a bad day to be a homeless guy.This particular track (\"I Eat Like S***\") begins with DeRosa's love for KFC, takes a quick detour to explain why fancy restaurants need to just stop it, does a quick Smoothie store drive-by, and comes back around to land on the worst thing that's ever happened to him. Ever.* It's so bad that it's funny, so unbelievable that is has to be true, and should come with a warning that you shouldn't eat while listening to this track lest you laugh so much you suffer the same chewed-up chicken fate as DeRosa.DeRosa is an engaging storyteller and this is especially true when he tells us about the time he decided to join a mosh pit (and the laugh-out-loud way he brought it to a halt) and a crowd in Michigan who proved to be less-than-ideal. In both instances we relate to DeRosa and are pulling for him, despite the seemingly insurmountable challenges he faces. And, in both cases, the more DeRosa explores the situation, the more laughs he's able to bring.When he's not struggling with the consequences of his own actions, he's taking aim at some well-deserving targets that have, for some reason, flown under the radar up to this point. Whether it's PBS and their ridiculously-priced donation thank-you packages or ill-behaved children who manage to compensate for \"25-year-old hot chicks\" by running into poles, DeRosa always presents an air-tight case. Once he's given his side, there really isn't much you can say to contradict him. If he were a prosecutor, after hearing DeRosa's opening statement, I wouldn't be surprised if the defending attorney simply threw his hands into the air and said to the judge, \"He's right. I got nothin'.\"It's because he's so good at getting his point across that he can tackle topics like choosing a skinny girl over her fat friend at a bar and the truth about Europeans with absolutely no fear. Regardless of where we stand when DeRosa starts in, we all end up on the same side, and we do so laughing all the way.---*Food-related Division**Ed's Note: DeRosa uses a phrase on this CD that immediately jumped out at me as simultaneously hilarious and fodder to be stolen and used. I freely admit it. So, in the future, when I enter a kitchen and randomly exclaim, \"I'm gonna eat all the egg sandwiches!!\" and I laugh and you just look confused well...now you know where I got it.\n", "val": 0.004251645412296057}

It all works wonderfully. The Tyler Bates tracks feature all sorts of subtle touches to convey a Spanish, Catalonian or Basque feel by turns.Hang on, I forgot that James Taylor's \"Country Road\" is in there too. Also \"Fusco\", a Spanish song credited to Berroguetto. It's a lively song sung to a full rock band backing. Oh, and David Gray's \"My Oh My\" is included.Oh heck, check the track listing for yourself. And while you are at it listen to the samples.On the basis of this album I'll be looking for other stuff by Tyler Bates.The perfect soundtrack to the film too, which if you haven't seen you should.Definitely one of my luckiest finds musically.

So many gifted artists have their abilities diminished by bad arrangements and productions. This second K D Lang cover of Leonard Cohen's song does not have that problem.

{"text": "\"Hallelujah\" has to be one of the most covered songs in recent pop history, and I swear I've heard it in every genre except, possibly, heavy metal or rap. This live presentation by Ms. lang is almost typical, using a slow, regular tempo and relying upon a simple orchestration.(When American television developed a fad for ending dramatic shows with at least a portion of some pop song this and Green Day's \"Time of My Life\" (sorry if that's the wrong title) were particularly used a lot and also entered the vernacular via American Idol - I own at least three versions of each already.<g>))What makes lang's \"Hallelujah\" absolutely stellar, however, are at least three things:  1) (L)ang's voice has the range and power to present the song clearly and fully, with clear enunciation and perfect pitch.  2) Her precise, emotive singing will make you listen and respond to the lyrics better than ever before.  3) It premiered during one of the most cluttered Olympics Closing ceremonies in which it seemed that every resident of Vancouver participated, but within a few seconds of lang's taking the floor, solo, in that enormous conference hall, she had the crowd mesmerized so nothing conflicted with her performance.Buy it; the quality of your life depends upon it.One last comment: As I cut my teeth as a lover of folk music in my teens in the '60s, everone knew Canadian singer/songwriter Leonard Cohen's \"Suzanne\".

{"text": "If you have listened to the RHCP catalog, saying that they are an ever-changing group is a vast understatement. They have had their highs, lows, rap-heavy, funk heavy, pop heavy and rock heavy albums with all mixes thereof in between. Why then would it be a surprise to fans to see another evolution of the band to follow up Stadium Arcadium?The hot topic of discussion has been John Frusciante's departure from the band and his replacement by longtime friend of the band Josh Klinghoffer. Josh is not John, and he should not try to be. That being said, he does as well, or better, as anyone else could be wanted to. If you are bent on hating the album because of Frusciante's absence, then the actual merits of the album itself mean nothing to you. Enough on that kick.As for the album, look for more layers, different grooves, styles and approaches than you have before and welcome them. Give it a few listens before passing a judgment (positive or negative). Flea is still slappin the bass and keeping it funky, Kiedis is still singing in his own signature way (with considerably less rapping for what it's worth), Chad is creating his beats that drive some songs and flow with others and Josh is fitting in very well if you ask me.What's the consensus? I think this album falls on the more chill side for RHCP, with songs with slower tempos and less in your face instrumentals, but have found that that's not such a bad thing. In fact, letting the album stand on its own, it's quite good.\n", "val": 0.01726190559566021}

This one does not disappoint. \"Monarchy of roses\" has stood out for right now for me. Josh has added plenty of good nuggets of sound. Flea has the groove rolling. I love the New Orleans R&B feel of \"did I let you know\". Being from New Orleans it is always comforting to pick up on the Meters that seem to creep into their sound. \"Police station\" will make my poolside mix for sure. Anthony K.s voice is really great.  He truly has an original sound that carries a true soul in every breath. Ive been waiting for this issue for a long time. will be a classic.\n", "val": 0.04074480012059212}
{"text": "Solid album that seems largely to have flown under the cultural radar.

{"text": "While I've been aware of some of the Red Hot Chili Pepper's hits over the last 20+ years, I never got hooked in enough to buy any of their albums - until now.  I'm starting my adventure at the end, and the only reason I tell you is so that you will know that I have no meaningful past to influence my review one way or the other.With that being said I think that I have been missing out if I'm With You is at all representative of what the RHCP are capable of.  The variations in style give this album depth that so much of today's music lacks.  This is not mass produced drivel aimed at the American Idol/Pop Radio crowd.  While this is not meant to be exhaustive, here are some of the styles that you will find on I'm With You.Let's start with what I call the rock and harmony tracks.  The main reason to start here is that the first track \"Monarchy Of Roses\" fits into this category.  It opens with a distorted vocal track, but it moves into a more melodic straight ahead rock with nice vocal harmonies in the chorus.  Another song in this category is \"The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie\".  This is the only song I had heard prior to buying the album.  RHCP score major points for mixing in the seldom used cowbell (insert joke/movie reference here).  It is a pretty basic rock song, and you could even argue that the chorus is somewhat of a give up with the stretched out opening line of \"Hey now.\"  I'm willing to overlook the simplicity because it's just fun to listen to.  Other songs in this bucket are \"Goodbye Hooray\" and \"Happiness Loves Company\".The next category is one that I'll call funk/rap.  Anthony Kiedis does a great job of the rhythmic spoken word style of delivery on \"Look Around\" and \"Even You, Brutus\".  Both of these songs also showcase the funky side of Flea's bass playing.  When you mix in some heavy \"wah\" pedal on the guitars, you have all the necessary ingredients for funky rap rock.Finally there are the slower, more purely melodic songs.  Calling them ballads doesn't seem quite right, but many would probably put these songs here.  Acoustic guitars and clean vocals are the highlights of \"Brendan's Death Song\".  \"Police Station\" has a slightly different feel from the undistorted electric guitar and the female background vocals.  The driven chorus gives it more of the \"power ballad\" feel, but that really isn't the right image.  However, the crown jewel of this category is \"Meet Me At The Corner\".  It is similar to \"Police Station\", but the chorus starts out with great earnestness but retreats to almost a whisper at its end.Hopefully this gives you an idea of what to expect from I'm With You.  This is one of my current favorites on my mp3 player.  It has a lot of variety, but what is truly great about is that the Red Hot Chili Peppers seamlessly transition between these styles throughout the album without missing a beat.Download this:  The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie\n", "val": 0.00218169204890728}

{"text": "Each and every song is brilliant. It takes about 2 or 3 listens to each song before it  fully \"sinks in\". Like described by the band, this album is quite different from previous work but still very much RHCP. The new guitarist is very much a subtle texture creator rather than a solo monster - influences the songs from the background. I only wish he was a little louder in some songs. His beautiful style is on display in \"Monarchy of Roses\" as soon as the initial grunge part ends. Flea, Kiedis and Smith all shine beautifully in each song.To all the people lamenting the departure of Frusciante and are unable to adjust in order  to witness the brilliance - I feel sorry for you :-) The new RHCP is every bit RHCP, every bit as brilliant, every bit as original, every bit as passionate and every bit as committed as before. These guys give it all for their music - and that has resulted in another album very pleasurable to listen to.I could try to describe how each song is beautiful but that somehow seems inappropriate, each song is unique in a multitude of ways - please discover each of these gems for yourself.\n", "val": 0.011976687237620354}

I know they lost another band member at some point, so it's always good to see a band pull it together and get something going again.With that said, you can definitely hear some of the influence that a new member can add to a band's music. And I would have to say for the better. Stadium Arcadium was MIND BLOWINGLY BAD, and I feel that this album is a COMPLETE turn around from that! The music feels fresh. In all, I would say that there was only one song that stood out as bad, and that's the last track. But the rest of the entire album is just SOLIDLY good!If you want a sample of what's best on here, listen to \"Brendan's Death Song\". Just pure Peppers!

{"text": "Unlike several great bands of the early 90s, these guys have been hitting it on the road hardcore all along for the most part.  Pearl Jam, Incubus, and Smashing Pumpkins stand out for me as the most disappointingly drastic changes in sound over the past 20 years.  If they start changing their live show, and refuse to play old material, then that is something to complain about.  Even though this production is a little poppy for my taste (which may be a gravitation on Rick Rubin's part), I like every song on the album.  These guys are the best live band ever in my opinion.  The show is energetic and incredibly entertaining.  The first single off this album \"Rain Dance Maggie\" is very lackluster.  However, I wasn't as disappointed with this album as I was \"By the Way\", because \"By the Way\" (the song) was a major flash-in-the-pan.  This album definitely reminds me of By the Way, in the fact that it is very poppy and lacks the funk we love from the Peps.  However, the songs are catchy (not in an annoying way), and I think these guys have so much respect from their fans, that it is hard to dislike anything they put out.

{"text": "This is probably my most-anticipated album of recent memory. Considering Stadium Arcadium, By The Way, and Californication are still in regular rotation (I actually just started going backwards; downloaded from here Blood Sugar Sex Magik, since I've never actually owned it, in seething impatience for this thing to be released) I could simply not wait to wrap my ears around it.I'm the type of music listener who tears apart an album. I know that while I may be immediately grabbed sonically it might not hold up with repeated listens. If I love an album I'll basically keep it on repeat for 3 months. I know I'm not the only one.There are those albums (what do we call them anymore? This is my second or third time buying an \"album\" that's not a physical product) that the opposite happens. On initial listen you're less than impressed. \"This is nothing I haven't heard before\" or \"eh.\" But then something happens. You find a day later your brain is singing to you, and you can't quite place why the music is so familiar. It's stuck in your head. And just like that, you love it.This happened to me for Red Hot Chili Peppers' I'M WITH YOU. At first it sounds very similar, almost boringly so, to the sprawling, eclectic, creative masterwork that was Stadium Arcadium, with sprinkles of the band's previous couple albums sprinkled in, minus the tight guitar genius that is John Frusciante. His presence is missed here but Klinghoffer's certainly no slouch, and adds in my estimation a more classic-riff, edgy guitar sound to the mix, where Stadium Arcadium, led admirably and beautifully by Frusciante's guitar (Flea is always, simply, awesome), had the tendency toward more chamber-music-y happy poppy sounds. I LOVE that album, but I agree with the criticisms that it had gone too far away from RHCP's funk-groove-nutjob vibe. Here, I'm With you seems to fully embrace where the band comes from while at the same time building on the musical education and evolution that took place in their music since they broke out and became a super-famous rock band.I will be listening to this \"album\" for a long time. It works its way right in there with Red Hot Chili Peppers' body of work, shows they have indeed grown up, in fact grown waaay past their \"sock-on-the-flop\" days, and they're mature, skilled, very talented musicians. Anthony Keidis is, to me, one of the most able and versatile rock vocalists alive. Even though his lyrics are wacked-out-almost-mostly-nonsense, they're consistently fun to sing along to, and I look forward to knowing every lyric to I'M WITH YOU before long.Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.002950668102130294}
{"text": "I bought the album the day it came out, and after a couple weeks of getting to listen to it, I feel like I have more of an objective opinion about it.This is their first album since 2006's Stadium Arcadium, and the first album with new guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. I thought I would give my opinion of the album over-all, why, and then write which songs are my favorites or stand out.If I had to give the album a rating of 1-5 stars, I would give it a **** (4/5). This is for several reasons. Like some reviewers have said, there seems to be a 'John Frusciante'-shaped hole in the sound of the songs. This is true. Although many of the songs sound more layered and textured than anything they have done since One Hot Minute, this textured approach has left many of the songs with somewhat of a sonic 'hole'. Where many of the Chili's fans would expect to find a catchy or interesting guitar/bass hook there are usually wide, open sonic spaces. For me, this makes some of the songs forgettable and blend together a bit too much for my taste. Josh Klinghoffer's approach to guitar-playing makes for interesting casual listening (textured and rhythmic), but I don't find much of I'm With You, that I would want to emulate with my own guitar. I will, however, say that I enjoyed I'm With You far more than I enjoyed Stadium Arcadium. I know that many fans were devastated when Frusicante left the group, but imo, Frusciante had done all he could with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He had given all he could, musically, and to me Stadium Arcadium suffered because of this. I find many of the songs on that album to almost be 'repeats' of Peppers work from By the Way and Californication. I truly believe the only way the band could have evolved from Stadium Arcadium was to do exactly what they did - they needed more percussion, more keys, songs with more layers. I will also say that I'm glad that they brought back a bit of their trademark funk-rock for several songs on I'm With You, such as on Factory of Faith, the Adventures of Raindance Maggie, and Ethiopia. As Chad Smith said in an interview this summer, this is a new band. It's the same name, but it's a newly revitalized and inspired group of musicians. The songs are more experimental than in the past, even with a song in 7/8 meter. As fun as some of the album's moments are, it is clear that this is a debut album from a 'new' band. The songs aren't perfect yet, but hopefully the Peppers will find their groove and the Sophomore effort will be well-worth the wait.My Favorite Songs:-Factory of Faith-Did I Let You Know-Goodbye Hooray-Happiness Loves Company-Even You, Brutus?The 'Best' Songs (not necessarily my favorites):-Factory of Faith-Brendan's Death Song-The Adventures of Raindance Maggie-Police Station-Even You, Brutus?\n", "val": 0.0007209274917840958}

The industry is full of such morons I guess that I can't understand them at all...Was it the engineers fault? Is he the one that should be shot? The guitars are ok but not on the level of Frusciante but possibly Josh was held back from taking more decent solos is my only other gripe. Some nice chords and arrangements he plays though.

{"text": "I admit it.  I had given up the Chili Peppers for dead after two lackluster albums, 2002's moribund \"By The Way\" and 2006's too-sprawling-for-its-own-good double album \"Stadium Arcadium.\"  Although I am a John Frusciante fan, I was curious what new guitarist Josh Klinghoffer would bring to the uplift mofo party.  I am pleased to say that he brings nothing less than a revival of energy, heart, and melody to this legendary band.\"I'm With You\" opens with a blast of distorted feedback and vocals, leading to the driving disco beat of \"Monarchy of Roses.\"  Flea's nimble fingers take center stage here, along with Chad Smith's crisp high-hat work.  Singer Anthony Kiedis sounds confident as Klinghoffer's subtle but persistent backup vocals provide solid support.  Klinghoffer offers a brief, Dave Navarro-like guitar interlude in the middle of the song before the groove returns and the song ends on a sunny note.The rest of the album lives up to this promising beginning.  \"Factory of Faith\" features a bubbling Flea bass line and a soaring chorus demonstrating impressive vocal simpatico between Kiedis and Klinghoffer.  Gentle acoustic guitar opens \"Brendan's Death Song,\" a plaintive song for a fallen friend.  The song builds slowly as Smith's drums provide propulsion and Kiedis' voice soars over Klinghoffer's atmospheric guitar.  Voices weave and dart in the song's final minute before ending on a melancholy note.  \"Ethiopia\" features more rich vocal harmonies (particularly in the chorus) and some interesting guitar textures from Klinghoffer.  The song is a good example of how the Peppers use space to let the compositions on \"I'm With You\" breathe rather than fill every moment with sound.Other highlights include the exotic syncopation, juicy trumpet and pounding percussion of \"Did I Let You Know,\" the surging, soaring \"Goodbye Hooray\" (featuring lyrics that could be the Peppers' creed: \"Well I'll see you around/I'll see you around/I'll play all night/Hey, don't get uptight\"), and the bouncy, buoyant \"Happiness Loves Company\" (which namedrops the Mothers of Invention).  In \"Police Station,\" the Peppers have one of their most beautifully constructed songs since \"Californication\" from the 1999 album of the same name.\"I'm With You\" concludes with three interesting tracks: the mid-tempo, piano-driven \"Even You Brutus?\", the gentle \"Meet Me At the Corner,\" and \"Dance, Dance, Dance,\" an intriguing blend of island percussion and airy, richly-layered vocal harmonies that features the optimistic lyric: \"The light is right/Let's play tonight/Let's make the ride/The summer thrives/Let's play.\"\"I'm With You\" primarily succeeds for two reasons: precision and melody.  Songs are tightly constructed and fully-formed; there is no \"I Like Dirt\" or \"Throw Away Your Television\" here.  Extraneous instrumental wankery and meandering are nowhere to be found.  The Peppers also seem to have rediscovered strong melody, something that had eluded them for more than a decade.  Rick Rubin's production, which I have criticized in the past, is warm and organic.  Klinghoffer could have been louder in the final mix but that is a small complaint.\"I'm With You\" shows a band maturing with grace and confidence, emerging from their 5-year hiatus refreshed and energized.  I, for one, welcome the change.\n", "val": 0.021876517683267593}

It's been a pleasure since then to explore the band's past and watch their evolution, but that album still has my heart most of all.Like everyone else, I was worried with Frusciante's departure.  Klinghoffer does a decent job, and my several play-throughs reveal that he's competent, and I'm sure I'll appreciate his efforts more as I become more familiar with I'm With You.  However, there's nothing jaw-dropping like John's effort \"Don't Forget Me\" on By the Way (still my favorite of Frusciante's).My first play-through gave me one conclusion: this is their most mellow album to date.  Nothing very high energy.  But it grows on you.  There are some standouts so far: \"Brendan's Death Song,\" \"Did I Let You Know,\" and \"Even You Brutus.\"Like all of RHCP's work, no two albums are the same.  This is proof of that.

{"text": "Five years ago, The RHCP releaed, IMO, an album for the ages...Stadium Arcadium.  28 tracks of rock, funk, punk, dance, ballads, R&B, and most importantly, guitar jams.  John Frusciante played his heart out on Stadium Arcadium.  The guitars just jammed throughout 2 cds. And then John quietly exited for the 2nd (and perhaps, last time). Enter the new guy, and you have an album so vastly different from the first time John left (the One Hot Minute effort with Dave Navarro) Their first single the Maggie Dance song, got me pumped, it sounded like Stadium Arcadium yet the guitar was something straight outta Freaky Styley...got me thinking \"Sweet...this album will be golden\". Upon first listen to I'm With You, it sounded more of the same S.A.-vibe, and the guitar the solos have a distorted, fuzz sound, and a tone similar to original member Hillel Slovak. But after numerous listens yesterday...I really can't hear any guitar licks stand out on this new cd.  I mean, of course the new guy Josh Klinghoffer(?) is playing on it, but as far as just letting the guitar rip on some songs...unless my ears and going, it ain't here!

{"text": "I've been a steadfast Red Hot Chili Peppers fan for many a year now. I own most if not all their music from the early beginnings to I'm With You and I thoroughly enjoy all of it and all their variety. A lot of the \"professional\" reviewers have seemed to made a lot of seemingly erroneous claims, for one reason or another and I'd like to address at least some of those.As many others have, I too have noticed that there are plenty of songs that are driven by the bass over guitar. Many people seem to attribute this to the lack of Frusciante and the presence of a \"lesser\" guitar player (either in terms of band presence or just simply skill), but I did not see it that way at all. Bass dominated songs are nothing new to RHCP; Flea has always been a prominent player compared to other bassists in other bands, but people seem won't to now place that on the lack of Frusciante. I think this is severely underrating Klinghoffer on the part of people who clearly don't have a good grasp of the breadth of RHCP's music and Klinghoffer's skill. I think there are plenty of songs that show off his talent quite well. For example, how many RHCP songs prior to Klinghoffer can you name that prominently feature the piano? Yet there are several songs on I'm With You that do so, such as \"Happiness Loves Company\" and \"Even You Brutus\" that feature piano or other keyboards. From the interviews and information I've been able to collect it seems that Klinghoffer was a large influence in the use of keyboards (as well as Flea). There are other songs that are heavily dependent on guitar. \"Meet Me At The Corner\" is a perfect piece that showcases Klinghoffer's skill with a very Hendrix/Frusciante style guitar line (but with its own twist), excellent backing vocals and even some surprisingly good lead vocal work from Klinghoffer as well. All in all I've been very impressed with his contributions to the band. Personal taste may dictate whether or not one appreciates the album as a whole, but I do certainly feel like it is unfair to Klinghoffer to underestimate his role just because of Frusciante's shadow.Overall I feel like this album is an excellent culmination of the various styles and sounds that RHCP has delved into over the years. Kiedis' singing and lyrical content seems to have further matured, although he still maintains his signature quirks and odd lines. Yes, you can still listen to the album and tell it's the same band that was releasing albums decades ago, but there's so much more to this album. A song like \"Ethiopa\" clearly shows that they're trying and experimenting with many new things, not just doing the same old thing over and over again like some generic pop band. I think \"Ethiopia\" might show this the most clearly. The song is largely written in 7/8 time and starts off with a driving bass line. Klinghoffer's first entrance on guitar seems innocuous enough, yet through it's simplicity they create an amazing effect as Klinghoffer is essentially playing in a different time signature, 4/4, with just one note on every beat. It creates a subtly twisted sort of hemiola effect where in one measure he's in sync with Flea while in the next he is playing the upbeat to Fleas downbeat. They continue to play off of each other in this sort of opposing fashion off an on throughout the song. It's absolutely brilliant!\n", "val": 0.003588973544538021}
{"text": "I wasn't sure what to expect from \"I'm With You.\"  'Rain Dance Maggie' was pretty good - but we're all used to getting blown away by singles like 'Dani California' and it's not like that at the moment.  Still, this album holds its own and, style-wise, it sits comfortably alongside 'By the Way' and 'Stadium Arcadium.'  Very much on the mellow side of the RHCP repertoire.  The track, \"Happiness Loves Company\" is sure to raise some eyebrows.  It sounds positively like late-60's pop-- reminiscent of something the Monkees might have played-- but a likable song overall.  There is no real RHCP funky thrashing on this album.  The days of head banging are over since they want to explore new approaches and I applaud that.  But I still kind of hope they prove me wrong on their next release.  I like Josh- but it feels like he hangs back even more than Hillel did.

But they all flow smoothly one after another and equally display Nevue's talent for balancing virtuosity, elegance, taste, and restraint.The result is an album that is an absolute delight to listen to. There is no single track or group of tracks that I found myself wanting to skip to and play over and over. They all fall easily on the ears. However, if I could only listen to one track, it would be Nevue's masterful interpretation of \"Jesu Joy Canon in D.\" Also, \"The Garden Swing,\" \"Just Because I Love You,\" \"Hand in Hand\" and \"Goodnight Sweet Angel\" are particularly affecting.A truly amazing aspect of not only this CD but also Nevue's music in general is the fact that he does not write or notate any of his original compositions or covers of other people's works. He plays everything by ear and memory.This wouldn't be so remarkable if this was jazz improvisation, where general thematic and chord structures usually serve as a launching pad for free-form solos. However, every one of Nevue's originals or covers is intricate and detailed, especially a piece such as \"Jesu Joy Canon in D,\" making Nevue's prowess on the piano even that more extraordinary.Whether you are a piano aficionado or a casual listener, this is one album that can be enjoyed by fans of all musical persuasions.\n", "val": 0.05302075669169426}

From the heartwarming cover photo of Nevue's daughter Noelle in a field of tulips to the last notes of Nevue's medley of \"Jesu Joy of Man's Beholding\" and \"Canon in D,\" this album celebrates the simple beauties and joys of life. Nevue's liner notes describe it perfectly: \"The music on \"A Delicate Joy\" is about living fully and joyfully. It's about freedom from worry, and about walking in faith, knowing God has all things in His hands. It's about love, family, and spending precious time together enjoying God's creation. It's about making the most of every single moment, because there isn't a moment to lose. Every moment matters. Life is a treasure to be enjoyed.\" All but two of the fourteen pieces are Nevue originals. The other two include the medley mentioned above and Nevue's arrangement of the traditional Irish song, \"Down By the Sally Gardens.\" I have to admit that I've always been partial to Nevue's darker music, but these pieces sparkle and dance, radiating the happiness of a peaceful heart and soothing our cares away.\"A Delicate Joy\" opens with the title track, a reflective and gently flowing piece that could be a prayer or meditation set to music. \"Traveling Light\" has a lighthearted lilt that hasn't a care or worry in the world. The simple melody and left hand rhythm pattern in \"The Garden Swing\" create a tranquil interlude - effortlessly kicking back and doin' nothing. \"A Vision in White\" was inspired when Nevue saw his toddler daughter in a white dress as a flower girl in a friend's wedding and thinking about how she would be walking down the aisle in her own wedding sometime in the future. Bittersweet and introspective, this is one of my favorites. \"My Happy Dance\" was inspired by Mike Strickland's \"foot-tappin' music\" and is quite different from most of Nevue's other music. It fits this album perfectly both theme-wise and musically - free-flowing fun. \"A Tiny Heartbeat\" conveys the wonder and awe of hearing a baby's heartbeat for the first time. The swirling and carefree \"Happily Ever After\" is a more-restrained yet effusive happy dance. \"Hand In Hand\" is a simple, heartfelt love song - slow, melodic, and honest. Love it! \"Under the Setting Sun\" is my favorite track. I love the gentle ebb and flow of the peacefully rolling rhythm and sensitive melodic line. I can't wait to play this one myself! \"Jesu Joy Canon in D\" is an effervescent ode to joy that combines the two classics with Nevue's improvisations and interpretations, ending the album with a happy smile.David Nevue has created another gem with \"A Delicate Joy\"!

While I enjoyed his two previous albums (\"Adoration\" and \"Revelation\"), those were arrangements of traditional hymns in a contemporary piano style.  The current album, on the other hand, is the first of Nevue's to highlight original compositions since his 2005 \"Overcome\" album. Just comparing the cover art on the two albums makes it clear that Nevue is in a different place, emotionally and musically, with \"A delicate joy\" than he was with \"Overcome,\" which had been written following the death of Nevue's father and was darker in emotional tone.The cover of \"A delicate joy,\" on the other hand, features Nevue's daughter, Noelle, walking in a field of tulips under a glorious blue sky, and the pieces on the album reflect a similar atmosphere of joy and a delightful feeling of being alive. This is \"feel good\" music at its best, lilting and jaunty and full of the promise of a bright new day.

{"text": "It has been a dissapointment that Kelly Clarkson hasn't really brought out her A-Game into her songs recently. With following-up to All I Ever Wanted, Kelly has had a strong gamble to make it worth while, but falls into fair territory with Mr. Know It All, the lead single from her 5th album Stronger, It is nothing to honestly rave about, and isn't really is driven as her harder songs had shown like Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Ms. Independent. Overall, I think Kelly Clarkson needs to find better strides in her music, than sing the same old thing again and again, musically. It shows a crack in her feeling of songs that she may noy know Mr. Know It All as it seems to be.Song: C\n", "val": 0.0006484592449851334}

{"text": "Kelly is back on the pop charts, and now, she is sounding more natural and live than ever.  Her voice on this song is amazing, no over-compression and none of that auto-tune used all too frequently on today's hits.  It is basically a mid-tempo jam, with a bit of attitude and a solid hook.  This song is feisty, and plays to Kelly's persona... but it has a bit of soul mixed into the groove, and I love how she uses her voice to advance the rythym and beat of the song.  Although not as immediately catchy as one of her pop-rock, guitar driven anthems, this is a grower and a total ear-worm.  I love it!! The more I hear this, the more it sticks in my brain, and forces me to listen again! Welcome back to the charts Kelly, we deserve to listen to a real vocalist and artist when we turn our radios onto top-40 stations!\n", "val": 0.026194103062152863}

This is one of her strongest efforts to date, with an excellent hook and beat, and very well produced. With With many other top female artists albums being a little older now, She should shine now with her own. While people put her down because of her Idol Days, she has consistantly been one of the most successfull, (with Carrie Underwood). Her selling power as American Idol winner no longer matters, she is earning it on her own now as a true music star. The American audience has voted, she is one of the best.\n", "val": 0.046739187091588974}

{"text": "Everyone who knows me knows how incredibly eager I have been for new Kelly Clarkson music since wearing out her previous effort \"All I Ever Wanted\" (her song \"Don't Let Me Stop You\" has scored 132 plays and counting on my iTunes). I search Google news for Kelly daily, and have been tracking the progress of the new album since its infancy. This is all to say that my expectations for this song were impossibly high. The weekend before her live webcast to debut the single, a demo version of the track leaked online, so I broke my rule to wait for the official release and gave it a listen. My first impression was a rather negative one, but that's how I feel upon listening to all of her work for the first time. Like all of Kelly's songs, this one just got better with each successive spin. I found the song a bit sleepy and formulaic (much like \"Already Gone\" in that sense). The ubiquitous comparisons to Bruno Mars's \"Just the Way You Are\" are entirely warranted; the drum track is resoundingly similar to Mars's song. However, I see the merit in mimicking his style, given the landscape of pop music today. Because Kelly is not a Gaga, Ke$ha, or Britbot, heavily produced dance artist, it is smart for her team to steer her toward a style that has had recent success with a more nuanced sound. The R&B flavor of this song dates back to Kelly's Idol and \"Thankful\" days, and it is difficult to stifle a sassy finger-wave or snap while singing along. That sassy swagger is Kelly's signature; even though this track isn't a guitar-heavy break-up song expected of a lead single, it still delivers that same girl-power punch. I appreciate her ability to defy the audience's expectations and completely own any avenue she decides to pursue. Her exquisite vocal delivery is a constant throughout the eclectic and fickle production that backs her from single to single and album to album. Some of my favorite moments in the song are the beautiful and soulful bridge (another Clarkson trademark), and the mouthful of lyrics that almost reminds me of the hook in Donna Lewis's \"I Love You Always Forever\" when Kelly wails \"you ain't got the right to tell me / when and where to go, no right to tell me.\" Overall, the song also reminds me of then sentiment in Ben Folds's recent single \"You Don't Know Me.\" It's a phrase that many of us go back to time and time again for self-empowerment, a theme of which Kelly is Queen.\n", "val": 0.0069227092899382114}
{"text": "There is no question that to so many, Kelly Clarkson has been the queen of the American Idol era. But just being the 1st winner of the reigning cavalcade of reality competitions, doesn't mean you really have the best when it does come down to music. Her latest song, Mr. Know It All isn't bad, while not the angry-getting angst song she had made so often before. It shows that Kelly is trying to take her foot moving forward, while not feeling like she has been copying someone else, like she had with those gimmicks from All I Ever Wanted in 2009. I do hope her upcoming album works well for her this fall. Hopefully, then we could possibly someone as a hopeful Ms. Know It All.Song: C 1/2+\n", "val": 0.004574056249111891}

{"text": "Levitation is my favorite Hawkwind album, and one of my all-time favorites of any genre of music.  Awesome space rock with a hard and slightly progressive edge.  Ginger Baker is an outstanding drummer, and this was the only Hawkwind studio album he participated on.  He adds a lot to the songs.  So does synthesizer player Tim Blake (of Gong fame).  This was also his only studio album with Hawkwind.  His synths sound very futuristic and spacey and cool.This was also Huw Lloyd-Langton's first studio album since the 1970 debut album.  His guitar work sounds very fresh and exciting.  I think this was his best lead guitar work of all the studio albums he played on.Fritz's review covers the packaging and sound quality.  I wish they had put Nuclear Toy right after Dust of Time.  Nuclear Toy was the only \"leftover\" song from the Levitation studio sessions, so it doesn't make sense to put it 15th, after 5 Hawklords songs.As for the concert material on discs 2 & 3, there are some real gems.  Baker is just smoking on Space Chase, disc 3.  Also, Keith Hale's Dangerous Vision was an excellent, overlooked Hawkwind song, and the live version here is great.I highly recommend this to Hawkwind fans.  Newbies should check the samples.\n", "val": 0.023277785629034042}
{"text": "The first 3000 copies will be the 3 cd set, then it will revert to being a single cd.  So don't hesitate too long in ordering this one. The packaging is outstanding.  You get a clamshell cd case, 3 cds in cardboard slipcases, 3 postcards, and a 35 page book.The sound quality of the original Levitation album on disc one is fantastic.  Although it was one of the first ever digitally recorded albums, the sound hardly suffers at all from the primitive DACs they must have been using in 1980.  Much more important than that though, is the new mixing and mastering are first rate.  This album has never sounded so good.  There is no clipping or distortion so prevalent in today's rock/pop world (go to wikipedia and look at 'loudness war' for more info).  This version has lots of dynamic range and even some headroom, which is almost unheard of on post 2000 rock releases.  I am so happy that Atomhenge treated this one as an audiophile company would have, giving us the best sound quality possible.  The sound is crystal clear, with outstanding separation, and the top end is so much better than earlier releases.  And the bass is mighty.The sound quality on the extras on disc one is so-so, but that is because of the source material, not the mixing/mastering guys.  There are some Hawklord tracks from '79.  The line was Brock, Bainbridge, King, and Swindells.  \"Douglas in the Jungle\", \"Time of\", and \"British Tribal\" are loose jams and mostly instrumental.  There is also the first version of \"Who's Gonna Win The War\", and the full length \"Valium 10\".  Nothing new, but still great to hear in better quality.  The disc also includes tracks with the Brock, Bainbridge, Lloyd-Langton, Baker, and Blake lineup: \"Who's Gonna Win the War\" and the b-side \"Nuclear Toy\".  The only unreleased track on the disc is a so-so live version of \"Brainstorm\".Most of the dec 18 1980 Lesisham Odeon gig appears on discs 2 and 3. Most of this material has been released before on the \"This is Hawkwind\" and \"This is Hawkwind Do Not Panic\" live albums. The gig was one of the great ones, and this set is with out a doubt the best sounding.  However it is not the complete gig.  One of the owners of Atomhenge has said:  \"We had to leave a few tracks off because the recording quality deteriorated vastly at various points.\"  Some hardcores, myself included, wish they would have left the bits in with the poor sq.  The Atomhenge people might be surprised what fans who listen to audience recorded boots will put up with. I should mention also that the earlier versions aren't complete either.  In fact, the music presented in this set is the most complete out of all of them.In summary: for Hawkwind fans this set is an absolute must have.\n", "val": 0.004343024920672178}

Quite a bit of variety for the waltzes, which made the composer so popular. Some polkas and 'marches' are included.  I'm not a music major or dance hobbiest.

{"text": "I've been waiting for this set to be released for a while now--and it's been worth the wait.  Like always there's no booklet, only a short essay on Leiber & Stoller  (LS)  and a few of the songs/artists.  The remastered sound is good overall.  The discs snap inside a tri-fold package.  I notice that Amazon has misspelled Leiber as \"Lieber\" on their page--oh well.Any fan of popular music of the Twentieth Century will have come across the names of Lieber & Stoller.  Together they've written some of the best and most popular tunes in popular music.  The evidence can be found in this collection which spans a number of musical genres.  You'll know many tunes here, but having them all in one collection, by some of the greatest artists of the period is almost overwhelming.  And when you add lesser known (but still good!) songs by L&S, the depth and range of their songwriting talents becomes very evident.  This collection is just a small sample of the duo's songwriting talents--it's by no means comprehensive.  But you can still hear their unique talents.Besides the obvious artists like Elvis Presley, The Drifters, The Coasters, Big Mama Thornton, Wanda Jackson, Big Joe Turner, Etta James, The Clovers, Ben E. King, Wilbert Harrison, and a number of others,  there's great tracks from lesser known performers like Little Esther, Mabel Scott, LaVern Baker, Jo Stafford, Linda Hopkins, The Robins, The Diamonds, and many others.  Some artists are represented by more than one tune--which is just fine.  L&S wrote so many good/great songs, and there were so many artists who gave those tunes life, that it's pretty difficult to find any filler among the 75 tracks included here.Suffice to say, if you're a fan of Twentieth Century popular music, you'll find a whole lot of good music collected here.  And the price, coupled with the good overall sound,  make this a no-brainer as far as purchasing this collection.  Once again European copyright laws make collecting tunes like this into one nice, neat package a real bargain.  Buy it and enjoy it.And if you want to know more about L&S, look for the book \"Hound Dog:  The Leiber & Stoller  Autobiography\".  It's a good read all about their lives both in and out of the music business and has some great information on many of the great songs they've written.\n", "val": 0.020179128274321556}

{"text": "This expanded British version of Ellie's debut album Lights (which topped the UK album charts) includes seven extra tracks. Among the extra tracks you'll find her excellent cover of Your song, which inspired me to make a rare foray into the world of contemporary pop music, and which closes the album.The bulk of the album (everything except Your song) comprises original material, all of it written or co-written by Ellie, which I regard as danceable pop music. It isn't really like anything else in my CD collection but Ellie has a great voice that is easily heard above the music. Prior to Your song, Ellie's biggest hit by far was Starry eyed, but three other singles (Under the sheets, Guns and horses, The writer) also made the charts with varying degrees of success, while Lights became a minor UK hit following the success of Your song.Your song, Ellie's biggest UK hit up to that point in her career and which also charted higher than Elton John`s original, isn't typical of the album but that's OK. Being recorded without any electronics, but  just cello, piano, timpani and vocals, it is more typical of the kind of music I normally listen to and will therefore remain my favorite track, but I also enjoy the rest of the album and will follow Ellie's future career with interest.\n", "val": 0.02791205234825611}

{"text": "With a gravelly voice and grinding guitars not to mention groovy drums and a grumbling special sound effect, Lifehouse blows off the roof with their smash hit `Hanging by a Moment.'  The song's philosophical edge is tempered by a tone of youthful desperation as well as a deafening defiance.  While primarily a love lyric to a girlfriend, the song speaks to the transitory and sometimes brutish nature of teenage life as relationships between boys and girls come and go moment to hanging moment.\n", "val": 0.004353923257440329}

Yet, she did save her best for last as a nice final bow to her voice, teaming up with Tony Bennett on Body & Soul for his Duets II record. The song is really classic as 2 singers could really make. It is a nice piece of art, and a very delicate swan song from Amy's voice. Tony and Amy really showed a classic style in their voices, yet it is so sad that Amy was not here to know how good her work with Tony was.

{"text": "When it has came down to Tony Bennett after 5 decades of making music, he has shown no signs of losing his voice, and especially his spirit. The 85 year old still sings like he is in his 30's and just knocks it out of the park each time. But for Lady Gaga, she has had really awful music with the past several years, and not really flexed her voice. Instead, she flexed her provocative image which made her voice absurd and weak. But surprisingly, she finally shows she shouldn't be considered a tramp. The Lady Is A Tramp, the second single from Tony Bennett's Duets II is a big surprise. Lady Gaga shows that she can be a voice, without the provocative image, and the chemistry fairs better than almost all of Gaga's songs she has ever made. I really was pleasantly surprised. It is a great follow-up from the somber Body & Soul he did with the departed Amy Winehouse. We'll see what sort of witchcraft Tony has in store for his next duet down the road, and that shouldn't be a tramp.Song: B-\n", "val": 0.002717840950936079}

Make sure to see the film as well, as knowing how they're used will only make you appreciate the songs on this album more. The one small problem is that this disc is missing at least one great song from the film. It's the song that Darlin plays on her radio while sitting on top of the cellar. I believe it was called \"Hat\", and, unlike the rest of these it was written and performed by Rian Johnson. I don't know if this is the same Rian Johnson who directed Brick and The Brothers Bloom (I would assume that it is and that only makes the song that much cooler), but I would have loved to have had that added to the track list here.

A great mix of hits from Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons (with a little Jersey Boys twist), The Mamas and the Papas, Beatles, The Drifters, The Zombies, Marvin Gaye, and the Turtles.  It is hard to pick a favorite song on the CD and once you hear it you will not be able to stop listening to it.  The only downfall to this CD is it leaves you wanting to hear more songs!

{"text": "If you're a fan of 60's pop then this CD is worth a listen as it is far more (and way better) than a standard cover album. The \"Midtown Men\" are made up of Christian Hoff, J. Robert Spencer, & Daniel Reichard (three of the original leads in Broadway's \"Jersey Boys\") along with  cast replacement Michael Longoria (the \"Frankie Valli\" role). If you were around in the era you'll know (and remember) all of the songs presented here - they are wonderful renditions, true to the genre and always note perfect. The CD contains eleven tracks(14 songs) with track 1 containing a medley of two 4 Seasons songs (\"Let's Hand On\" & \"Working My Way Back To You\") mixed with the Neil Sedaka classic \"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\"  and track 10 a mix of \"Big Girls Don't Cry\"  & \"Sherry\".  I think they rely too heavily on 4 Seasons identified songs with 7 of the 14 songs coming from their catalog of hits but it's impossible to argue that they don't perform them well. If you have the \"Jersey Boys\" original cast album you already have  about half of this album (by 3 of the same performers) although there are some arrangement changes here. This would be a perfect group to see live as they don't seem to rely on all of the studio tricks that so encumber, overshadow and often enhance weak performances by recording artists today. Problem here is that this 32 minute CD is selling for upward of $30 - a lot of money for a first recording of pretty generational specific cover material - no matter how good it might be. I'd say shop around until you find a good deal - it's definitely worth a listen but I'm not quite sure that it's worth the price currently being asked. However, if you're interested in a download you can buy it here for less than $10. The performance deserves 5 stars but the cost of the CD along with the fact that so much of the material appears on the \"Jersey Boys\" cast recording makes me wonder if maybe an overall score of 4 stars would be more representative of the entire \"package\" - but I haven't the heart to give it less than 5 stars.\n", "val": 0.003705017501488328}

{"text": "The original cast of Jersey Boys are now Midtown Men on this album of nostaglic ear-candy. The Midtown Men resurrect American pop songs from the 1960s on the aptly-titled Sixties Hits. Eleven songs represent a wide array of pop hits, including \"Dawn,\" \"Time Of The Season,\" \"Ain't That Peculiar,\" \"Candy Girl,\" \"Up On The Roof,\" \"Can't Buy Me Love,\" \"California Dreamin',\" \"Big Girls Don't Cry,\" \"Bye Bye Baby,'' plus several others. The execution of the songs is generally well-developed and fairly close in sound to the original hits with full instrumentation. The upbeat songs are well-suited for the vocal ranges of the Midtown Men. The flamboyant theatrical and Broadway-inspired antics are appropriately-suited for the songs on this album. The party-type song styles and feel-good music is highly-recommended for fans of pop hits from Americans golden era of music. Fans of the original artists will be pleasantly-surprised throughout.

{"text": "I do not like worship music-----the worship music of today to be exact.  The last decade has seen an explosive new industry in music that continues to grow and bank millions of dollars every year.  Colleges now even offer bachelor degrees in worship music.....and the unfortunate thing about the whole of it is the killing of art in one of mankind's oldest forms of expression:  communicating the otherworld and his connection to his Maker through music.  I speak as one who is an artist and has been a worship leader before, and the last several years have found me completely disconnected from worship music period.  Too often we find contemporary worship mimicking what's been done before to the point of cheesiness, aimlessness, and vanity.  The focus has gone from simply making art for the Lord to being as prestigious on stage as possible------all in a masquerade of Christian conviction.Yet not all Christian artists fall into that category.  A friend introduced me to Gungor's \"Beautiful Things\" last year.  Upon taking it in, I thought the band had great potential and had unleashed a bit of it in some of the tracks from the album, but much of it still felt like the same old, same old.  Just the other night I heard that Gungor had made a new record with a title taken from a line from C.S. Lewis' \"The Great Divorce\".  I looked it up, listened to the samplers, read every review I could google, and finally decided to just buy the album.\"Ghosts Upon the Earth\" is truly a throw back to the art Christians used to make.  The entire album functions as a cohesive whole, each track a specific movement in a musical narrative.  The approach the band took was most appropriate, which was \"Let's ignore the rest of the music industry and attempt to make something that demands all of our creativity, something that we would be proud of in laying at God's feet as a work of art.\"  And they pull off that approach extraordinarily.  From the epic \"Let There Be\", to the moving \"Ezekiel\", to the very end of the album, I could tell that every strum of guitar, every stroke of the cello,  every note played on the piano served a purpose in the whole of not just the single track, but the entire album.  The music will take you from darkness to light, and instead of feeling like you're in a contemporary church, you will feel like you are in the company of minstrels dancing and singing on a hilltop during twilight.If you are sick of radio friendly albums jazzed up with only singles for the top 40, whether you be in the secular or Christian music circles (or both), \"Ghosts Upon the Earth\" will feel like magic.\n", "val": 0.00014915365318302065}
{"text": "I think this record is a great step forward for Gungor. They have certainly set a new bar for many bands in this genre of music and those artists should take notice.

{"text": "Let me start this out by saying, I absolutely love this album. I don't know that I can coherently explain everything about why though...This album takes you on a journey from emptiness and the moment of man's creation through man's fall through man's rebellion to God to man's final redemption.It's a big task, but they meet it with gusto. And instruments. Lots and lots of different instruments. Choirs, mandolins, banjos, xylophones, strings, and much more!The haunting opening track with the boy choir singing the refrain \"let there be\" grabbed me from the moment I heard the album.It quickly picks up with the joy of the newly created world with Brother Moon.I was emotionally moved by the fall of man in The Fall. The intricate lyrics on this one deserve to be listened to with booklet in hand (well, on screen at least).This Is Not The End is just so stirring!AAAAAH I really can't explain this music, it's something that you simply feel. You must listen to this on a good sound system that lets you hear all the nuances then sit back and close your eyes and let it wash over you, empty you, fill you, and make you glad to be alive.\n", "val": 0.01924956403672695}
{"text": "After a release as successful and simply excellent as last year's Beautiful Things, I knew Gungor was going to have a hard time topping it with their next offering, which was to come a mere year and a half later. As Michael Gungor said in his post about the new album, \"there was a temptation to take the safe route on this album and try to make a `Beautiful Things-2.' We knew people liked it, and the easy plan would be to try to do it again. That's not what we did.\" There is more truth to that statement than you might believe: Ghosts Upon the Earth isn't a \"Beautiful Things 2' by any stretch of the imagination. It's something almost entirely different, and whether that is a good or bad thing I suppose depends on how the listener chooses to listen to it. There's no denying that Ghosts Upon the Earth is full of artistically stunning music and a powerful, cohesive story; I think it will really just depend on what the listener makes of it. This listener, at least, is thoroughly impressed with the record; and here's why:Ghosts begins its artistic narrative with the Beginning in the epic opening track \"Let There Be.\" Lisa Gungor's stunning vocals lead an awe-inspiring crescendo that musically feels a lot like you might imagine that moment where God said, \"Let there be light,\" would have been like. The wonderfully deep and upbeat worship tune \"Brother Moon\" follows with a sense that the brand new Creation is worshiping its glorious Creator with lyrics like, \"You're glorious, You're holding us together.\" \"Crags and Clay\" also captures a true sense of awe-inspired worship, only with a quieter sound than \"Brother Moon.\" The quiet, captivating \"The Fall\" effectively brings in the album's idea of men being \"like ghosts upon the earth,\" while \"When Death Dies\" follows with hope of eventual redemption (perhaps representing God's promise of a Savior after the fall in Genesis 3?) with a unique mix of a Latin guitar and a driving bass and drum groove.At this point, you've already heard a pretty phenomenal set of songs, but Ghosts isn't even halfway over yet. Some of the album's strongest tracks are saved for last, especially from \"Ezekiel\" to the end. \"Ezekiel\" is practically heartbreaking as it describes the way Christ loves His Bride (the Church) despite her unfaithfulness, but the beautiful \"Vous Etes Mon Coure (You Are My Heart)\" comes immediately after as a gorgeous love song between Christ and a redeemed, repentant Bride who again adores her Husband (\"When You first regarded me / Your eyes filled me with grace / Thereby again my eyes / Merited to adore You\"). The proper response to such a great love is wonderfully displayed in the three closing tracks beginning with the grandly triumphant \"This Is Not the End\" and continuing in all-out worship through the delightfully bluegrassy \"You Are the Beauty\" and the beautiful sense of surrender in \"Every Breath.\"The album's two middle tracks, \"Church Bells\" and \"Wake Up Sleeper,\" are quite good, too, but they don't fit in with the rest quite as well, which makes them a bit weaker. Still, \"Church Bells\" has solid lyrics and a light, fun mood while \"Wake Up Sleeper\" is effectively dark and strong musically with lyrics that recall some of Jesus' harsher words He spoke to the religious leaders in Israel at the time.What makes Ghosts Upon the Earth so strong, though, is a combination of two particular characteristics, starting with the incredibly intricate artistry that composes every single song. The very structure of the songs is unusual in many ways, whether it's cutting a final chorus in favor of a lengthy and simply awesome outro (\"Brother Moon\"), utilizing some offbeat-feeling time signatures (\"Crags and Clay,\" \"Wake Up Sleeper\"), or simply using three big, grand verses without a chorus to tie them together (\"This Is Not the End\"). Gungor's choice of instrumentation is also incredibly unique; you won't even hear an electric guitar on Ghosts, but instead there are plenty of strings, banjos, flutes, an oboe, and a wide array of other instruments you wouldn't normally expect to hear on a modern worship album. Also, everything on this record musically is intentional in the way it paints a picture to go along with the music, which makes every track incredibly effective musically and lyrically.The second major strong point for Ghosts is definitely in the overarching story that makes it cohesive and unified. Seriously, this is an album you have to listen to, preferably with headphones on and the lights off. In order to fully appreciate any of these songs individually, you must understand how each one fits into the album's story; no song is fully complete without the context of the songs next to it in the tracklisting. For example, \"When Death Dies\" is fantastic by itself, but a lot of power is added to it when you understand that it's a promise of redemption after \"The Fall\" desperately asks, \"How long 'till you save us all?\" Also, the final five tracks are practically inseparable; that's not to say that you can't enjoy them individually, but for instance, you have to know what happens in \"Ezekiel\" to fully appreciate the beautiful love song that follows it, \"Vous Etes Mon Coure (You Are My Heart),\" and you have to understand the concepts of those songs to really understand why \"This Is Not the End\" is so incredibly and epically victorious. Ghosts Upon the Earth, unlike most other music released today, is an `album' in the truest sense of the word in that it really needs to be listened to from start to finish, and that unity makes it incredibly strong.So really, at the end of it all, when \"Every Breath\" finally fades out, all you can really say is, \"Wow.\" Ghosts Upon the Earth might not be perfect; in fact, it's hard to say whether it's really better or worse than Beautiful Things; but comparisons aside, the incredible intricacy of the music makes it excellently artistic and the cohesiveness of the overarching story weaves the whole thing together beautifully. That said, this is what you should do right about now: buy Ghosts Upon the Earth, really listen to it next time you have about 50 minutes to spare, and through your listening to it, let your heart worship the Lord for the glorious, wonderful, worthy God He has been, is, and always will be, and for everything He has done for His Bride even in her unfaithfulness. Excellent work, Gungor, you have truly crafted the work of art that you wanted to create with Ghosts Upon the Earth. Thank you for being bold enough to be outstandingly creative and do something different to sing fresh and new songs to our wonderful Lord.\n", "val": 0.014512925408780575}
{"text": "To be honest I wasn't a huge fan of the last release by Gungor. While it showed their musical prowess, it felt more like a sampler than like a cohesive album from one band. However this installation seems to be heading in the right direction and Gungor's sound is more identifiable in a healthy way. Each track connects very much like filmscore, layering plenty of instrumentation in such a way that places you within every word that's sung. It sweeps the listener from moments of intimate and transparent dispair to anthemic choruses of of joy and hope.

{"text": "They did it again!Gungor likes to do very interesting stuff. They could have gone and done a \"sequel\" to Beautiful Things, yet they raised the bar and did something completely diferent and exciting!From the moment when \"Let there be\" starts the album, until \"Every breath\" closes it, a story is told. Every song has something to say, and it's not complete without the rest of the songs. Gungor has this gift of telling a lot of things without the need for too many words. And of course, the arrangements and performances are top-notch.If you want the usual Christian mainstream music, this is not for you. But if you just open your mind a little bit, you'll find this album can take you in a journey where you will find joy, despair, anxiety, sillyness and many other undescribable emotions.\n", "val": 0.02494227886199951}
{"text": "As a musician and singer-songwriter (hobbyist), I'm super picky about my music. I usually criticize about 95% of the music so much that it annoys people I am close to. However, Gungor is definitely different. In terms of 'Christian' affiliated music, this band has no equal in my opinion. There is so much depth and variety in the music and lyrics, yet at the same time, there's a simplicity there. This album is hands down my favorite album of the year. When you listen to it, listen to it all at once if you can and it's a beautiful tapestry of glimmers of angst and hope all meshing into a 'post liturgical' symphony of awesome.Buy it!\n", "val": 0.016404056921601295}

It is cinema.This is not \"Beautiful Things Part 2\", but it does seem a natural progression for the band.  It contains complex beat patterns, unique blends of instrumentation, beautiful harmonies, and authentically honest lyrics.  There is certainly plenty of diversity among the songs, and yet the album has a one-ness to it.I'm encouraged to see another example of Christians creating original, artistic, quality music.  Despite it's overtly Christian themes, Gungor's authentic approach manages to avoid being preachy.  It feels like we are eavesdropping on Gungor as they serenade their Savior.  In essence, this is an album of love songs-- it was not written for us...  Perhaps *this* is exactly why \"Ghosts Upon the Earth\" is so good.Whatever your theological persuasions may or may not be, if you are a part of the human epic (hint: you are), I highly recommend this album.\n", "val": 0.034082911908626556}

{"text": "I first heard Gungor at the Chicago leg of David Crowder Band's last tour. They are amazing! There are very few bands out there today that still try to appreciate a wide range of instruments and types of music; Gungor strikes me as a very intelligent band in their ability to fuse styles and instruments together in a song that you would not have thought worked together (but do so beautifully). Top all that with deep, meaningful lyrics.Furthermore, they are a great band in that they can actually perform live and sound great. Personally i've long grown tired of the bands/performers that sound good via computer manipulation and can't carry a tune or play their instruments live. Gungor is great live; Michael Gungor has a great voice with a slightly higher pitch but deep, rich tones (if that makes any sense...) and Lisa Gungor has a very pretty ethereal quality to her voice. Top that with their abilities to play instruments (Lisa's xylophones - sorry I know there's a more correct term for the instrument they're really playing these days, but it resembles a xylophone - and this old-style accordion-like piano she plays is so cool). They brought an incredible celloist with them too who was probably also the greatest beat boxer i've ever heard.Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.035193704068660736}

About the same time I got this album, I started to pay attention to lyrics more.  I would also say BECAUSE of this album, lyrics (and songwriting) have become so much more alive to me.  Art has become so much more apart of me.  I'm really thankful for Gungor and all those involved that produced this...sonic adventure!I always find it interesting to reflect upon how I impromptu-respond to people, to whatever inquiry, big or small, they make with me.  I've found that in every situation, I've been saying to people \"Ghosts Upon the Earth\" is some of the most important music I've heard in my life.  I'm trying not to just over-exaggerate-gush over it, but it's not just the music that has affected me...it's the lyrics too.  As a music person, I hope that says something about the album.The album definitely has a feel, but the songs don't all sound the same.  They all take you somewhere.  \"Crags and Clay\" is one of my favorite songs.  The melodies and words are haunting and stick with you.  \"Wake Up Sleeper\" is fiery like a Great Awakening sermon, something you want to yell at the top of your lungs not just to the injustice you see around you, but to the injustice you see inside.  Not an album to jam in the road, but something to take in quiet times, like a nice red wine on a chilly nite.Some themes seem to repeat, musically and lyrically, but it's not much of a big issue to me.  Everything in this album redirects my heart and mind to remind itself to stay in wonder of God's glory.  Super thankful.  I think the great thing is that this small creation inspires me to create as well, and to share, and to glorify God in my music as well...and to encourage the art-makers around me to do the same.Yes!\n", "val": 0.010386480949819088}

{"text": "Ancient Skies was a solid album full of excitement and some fun songs.  Beautiful Things was released and that's when I first heard of Gungor.  They continued the rock-worship sound with that album, but also added even more musical complexity, depth, and beauty.I believe this album, Ghosts Upon The Earth, was a very bold step forward.  They left behind their original yet comfortable rock-worship roots and have embraced a more orchestrated, earthy, folksy feel.  They certainly showed hints of it throughout their other albums, but they have stepped into it much more fully here.Many of us crave something different: something that is original and not the same old cliche stuff.  Though there are several bands that fit that description (Sufjan Stevens being one of my favorites), none of them (that I have seen) have what Gungor offers here.I feel that music's original purpose was to glorify the Creator, and through the beauty of artistic creativity, musical complexity, lyrical depth, and an unwavering focus upon the Creator, Gungor helps to steer music to its most natural place of being and joy.Yet you don't have to be a Theist to enjoy and appreciate this album just as you don't have to be an atheist to appreciate Pink Floyd's music.\n", "val": 0.020095746964216232}

At first I was intimidated by the fact that several religions were involved  and ignored the video and music. The videos and the song's kept coming up and so I finally took the opportunity to listen and educate myself on what it is. The message was just as beautiful as the music. Thank you so much for opening my eyes and my heart. We live in a world that is very narrow mined and how sad are we that we don't open our eyes and ears to the beautiful sound of our own brothers and sisters sharing a message of hope and inspiration. Thank you amazing children for your beautiful message and to all that was involved in this beautiful project. Much success and love you all of you <3~Cassandra~\n", "val": 0.01970512419939041}
{"text": "'It works, it really works'As a bit of a 'lazy ass, emergency-buddhist' I came across the announcement on the Beyond Facebook page a couple of months ago and though: 'that might be dope'. I bought the hardcopy album 2 weeks ago and it has been glued to my cd player ever since. It got me moving again. Started chanting again and studying the mystical law after a bit of a rough patch in the last couple of months. Children Beyond shows/reminds us that it is actually dead easy to take a firm grip on the helm of your own life by becoming active and sing. Sing along with the beautiful mantra's and prayers and get off your lazy ass and change things within yourself ... and the world around you will change with you.What better way than to start with children as they are our future. And in this project they show us grown-ups the way.Another reviewer mentioned that he thinks it is a less positive thing that Tina, Dechen and Regula are less vocally present on this album. I disagree. Not that their voices are not beautiful, they definitely are but can be admired also on their own works. While the 'first Beyond' to me is a wonderful listening album for contemplation, Children Beyond takes things a step further and evokes action: sing along, sing for yourself, chant and polish the mirror that reflects your true self.My personal favourites are Calling, Om Am Hum, Ganesha Sharanam (can't keep sitting still to that one), Sallallah' Ala Muhammad (where 'Persia almost becomes tangible') the beautiful Sarvesham Svastir Bhavatu and my top, top favourite: Buddham Saranam Gacchami. Probably because it's closer to my heart and the impact of being reminded of 'taking refuge' in your buddha nature is really overwhelming.The perhaps most powerful and amazing realisation this album (and hopefully soon 'movement') reveals,  it that it's a bag of seeds. Different in form and size but all containing the potential power to develop respect, compassion and kindness to oneself and others and show the door to enlightenment by singing them. The Three Ladies combine talents and become through their music and voices compassionate teachers and develop fertile ground for the seeds of this album to sprout.And as Ghandi says on my fridge magnet and in the back of the Children Beyond booklet: Be the change you want to see in the world.Starting to sing along with this CD is a good start!\n", "val": 0.008771127089858055}
{"text": "Review first published on tinaturnerblog.comChildren Beyond is the follow-up to the 2009 album Beyond. This album marked a remarkable shift in Tina Turner's career, as it was her first involvement in a spiritual project. Beyond was a big success, reaching a top 10 position in the Swiss album charts and raising approximately 300,000 Swiss Francs (325,000 US Dollars) for several charity projects. Therefore, it was a logical decision to continue the project with Children Beyond, which will be released in Switzerland today.There are a few significant departures from the first Beyond album. The most noticeable is that Tina Turner, Regula Curti and Dechen Shak-Dagsay are now joined by a choir of thirty children. The three ladies are not as prominently featured, the children are the real stars.For this album, a wider range of prayers and songs from different religions was chosen. The album includes songs from Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Sikhism. This creates an incredibly varied sound, with a very rich range of languages, instrumentation and voices.The key to Children Beyond is participation. It is not just an album for listening; the goal is to get children and adults in contact with different religious traditions and through this way increase respect and tolerance. Therefore, the booklet that comes with the album contains lyrics and positions for each song, so it is easy to sing along. The message of each song is explained, there are songs for concentration, healing, celebration and calmness. Although the aim is to reach children, it can be very useful for adults as well. The layout is very well done, making it very attractive to give the singing a try!Most of the songs are simple and involve a lot of repetition. Each song is sung by the children's choir, who are sometimes joined by one of the three singers. The one exception is the first song Calling, a spoken-word / rap song in which Tina introduces the album: when you sing, you do the right thing! This is one of the most powerful tracks of the album. After the introduction, the album includes twelve prayers and mantras from different religions. The most powerful songs are the Islamic prayer Allah Hu, the Buddhist mantra Buddham Saranam Gacchami and especially the Hindu peace mantra Sarvesham Svastir Bhavatu, in which Tina leads the children through a call and response.The final track of the album, Unity, which was released as a digital single, is another stand-out track. The song combines six declarations of affirmation from the different religions on the album: Amen, Amen, Amin, Om Sarva Mangalam, Om Shanti, Sat Nam. It is the only song on the album on which the three different singers take solos.Children Beyond is a wonderful album and is a wonderful addition to the Beyond project. It really succeeds in its aim to invite the listener to participate and to broaden one's musical and religious horizons. The album is very accessible and it can reach a wide audience. The only negative aspect is that Tina, Regula and Dechen are often too much on the background. Their beautiful voices deserve to be more prominently featured. But, it seems that Children Beyond is just a next step in the Beyond project, and that many more chapters will follow in the future!\n", "val": 0.019001994282007217}

This is excellent music to listen to while taking a short 1 hour trip because the pace and style of the music varies enough that it does not sound the same throughout. The song titled Celebrate Me Home is a gospel-jazz sounding number that uses the Sounds of Blackness choir as well as vocals from Brown and his daughter Rochela Brown and this song is a departure from what has been on Brown's albums before so it takes a couple of times listening to get what Brown is trying to do, especially if you never heard the original version of the song.

{"text": "Having just been exposed to the music of Norman Brown,and only having two of his CD's it was only lucky this just happened to be the follow up to the other I had. In case most of you don't notice I tend to like to listen to two albums by the same artist one after the other,preferably follow ups so I can get an idea of their musical progression. Being a visual artist it really helps me to listen to music in this manner. Considering the largely instrumental jazz offerings of his previous album<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stay-With-Me/dp/B000NJL4WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stay With Me</a>,it seemed more than appropriate that he would look to a more vocal and soulful approach on his follow up release. Considering the awkward way contemporary R&B was handled on that album,it seemed a creative gamble. But he actually made it work a lot better here.  The first three numbers \"Come Go With Me\",\"Thinking About You\",\"Here's My Number\" ,\"I'm Pouring My Heart \"and the title song are all funky,sleekly produced numbers-all of varying tempos and possessing grooves (and vocals in the case of the latter three) that are highly complimentary. All of them have a more R&B/funk flavor than jazz rhythmically. But in a more late 70's/early 80's mold than anything relating to the hip-hop cliches of urban contemporary R&B. My favorite number here is \"Playtime\",an uptempo horn packed salsa soul-jazz number with a strong melody to boot. The Sounds Of Blackness show up for a nice epic version of Kenny Loggins 70's soul standard \"Celebrate Me Home\" that's also of high musical and vocal quality of course.  The more traditional \"smooth jazz\" of \"Special Moments\" and \"Coming Back\",along with the more modern R&B style of the closer  \"One Last Goodbye\" are the weaker of the numbers here. But even here the strength and feeling of Norman Brown's playing never abandons him and he continues to keep the musical tide at as high a level as possible. The generally more soulful and festive atmosphere of this album showcases a possible new future for the pop jazz sound without the cliches of either smooth jazz or contemporary hip-hop based productions. There was absolutely nothing wrong with where things were going in the late 70's/early 80's in jazz/funk/pop music. There was just the right mixture of slickness,instrumental ability,song craft and groove. And this showcases that,even in modern times those combinations can still work just as effectively.\n", "val": 0.010134239681065083}

The lyrics themselves are not poor, but not outstandingly memorable...it's your standard song about not letting others bring you down and finding inner strength to heal.But the vocal performance is raw and moving. And that's what you want in a singer, as opposed to rote performance, or striving to hit Every Note Just Right while sacrificing the telling of the story.The notes are important, obviously, or it might as well be a poem, and her voice is good, especially for her age. She has more range than I had expected, and hopefully she'll treat her voice well as she gets older.But the raw edge and breaking of the voice, instead of sounding like a crappy American Idol audition, really convinces you that she feels every single word and that she's telling you something about her own experience.

For Demi Lovato, she hasn't been able to shine musically, as she had expected to be. For her song Skyscraper from her self-titled debut album, she doesn't seem to show that intimacy as she has made the attempt to. I really had expected better from her, after getting help from a eating disorder, and personal issues. The song is alright at first, but just not anything to really rave about. I do hope she comes out with better music soon, something that is even taller than the skyscraper she has shown to deal with.Song: C+\n", "val": 0.00022610345331486315}

Too many of these young female starlets hide behind PR and seek help only when court mandated, and obviously don't take any of it serious (L.L.).  I think this song is catchy as well as a good eye opener to the young girls who look to these stars and idolize them.  Bringing humanity into the equation- and not perfection makes this a good song.

Willie Nile can count as fans Bruce Springsteen,  Jesse Malin, The Alarm , Tori Amos., Lucinda Williams and yet unless you are a `Nilehead\" Nilefile\" chances are you may not be familiar with Willie and that is a shame. WFUV 90.7 The Radio Station of Fordham University DJ and staff member John Platt had a series for years at New York Music venues that introduced lesser know or artist that  should have more attention then they have received called `Under the Radar\" that title can describe Willie perfectly but now Willie with his latest studio release THE INNOCENT ONES might finally get the attention for those that Willie was Under the Radar. The Innocent One made possible by Willie passing the hat around to fans worldwide through KICKSTARTER a site that allows musicians since the demise of the record company signing and backing artist to raise funds on there passing that hat collected just under $20,000 to fund The Innocent Ones .The collection has 11 tracks and all 11 tracks contain Willie's Kick ass stadium anthem power. The disk begins with \"Singin Bell\" and includes \"The Innocent Ones\" which is the title track there  is something for everyone softer acoustic \"Rich and Broken\" , \"Sideways Beautiful\" and louder and sing along  track One Guitar probably the destined to become a Rock Anthem proposing the idea that one man with One Guitar can change the world and make a difference . It not a easy task to bring Willie's powerful Rock live shows to a disk but if you put in the disk and turn it up loud and real LOUD  you will get it  How powerful is Willie's music ? Let's put it this way He has been known to blow the roof off venues on more than one occasion back in 2009 Bruce Springsteen played a series of shows at the home of the NFL New York Giant and New York Jets Giants Stadium Bruce invited Willie to join him on stage at 2 of those shows a few months after those guest appearances they knocked down the stadium and replaced it officials are still debating to this day  if Willie had anything to do that.

{"text": "Willie Nile is clearly possessed by the spirit of rock `n' roll. Three albums into a renaissance that began with 2006's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Streets-of-New-York/dp/B000E6EJAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Streets of New York</a>, the sixty-three-year-old singer-songwriter continues to turn out arrestingly good music. At an age that most rockers have retired, resigned themselves to oldies shows or simply turned into lesser versions of their younger selves, Nile is enriching his work with age and experience. His voice remains charged with idealistic belief, and he propels his tight band forward as he unleashes anthems, pop songs and powerful ballads.His latest album opens at full throttle with \"Singin' Bell,\" the drums racing, the rhythm guitars building a wall of energy and Nile singing out like a twenty-first century Woody Guthrie. His populist mission is clear when he sings \"I'm a soldier marchin' in an army / Got no gun to shoot / But what I got is one guitar.\" It's a theme he develops through lyrics that gather the tribe and speak for unempowered. He lauds the decency of the commoner and shows pity for the insulated rich, he sings moaning Dylan-esque folk on \"Sideways Beautiful,\" tips his hat to Buddy Holly for \"My Little Girl\" and rouses the spirits of 1977 punk with \"Can't Stay Home.\"The album's last song, a mid-tempo tune that suggests early Tom Petty, opens with the lyric \"If memory were money, I would spend every penny thinking of her.\" It's a clever turn of phrase (as is the follow-up \"If fire was her daughter, I would drink a pail of water just to kiss her\"), but like most of Nile's lyrics, it's something more - it's a memorable expression of a deeply felt emotion that's turned into a shared with the listener. Shared experience is a hallmark of Nile's songwriting, and the reason his fans remain so passionate thirty years after he debuted. This album was originally released in the UK in 2010, but is just now getting the stateside push it deserves. [2011 hyperbolium dot com]\n", "val": 0.01893526129424572}
{"text": "He may be in his early 60s now, but Willie Nile is absolutely in the prime of his career. \"The Innocent Ones\" is his third terrific album in the last 5 years (following \"Streets of New York\" and the amazing \"House of a Thousand Guitars\"). As with his other albums, Willie's songs fit several different genres, and he excels at all of them; there are great ballads like \"Song for You\" and \"Sideways Beautiful,\" there are terrific pop/rock tunes like \"My Little Girl\" and \"Far Green Hills,\" and there's the rockin' title song plus \"One Guitar\" - both of which have sing-a-long choruses that will stay in your head for days. On a letter-grade basis, my rating for this CD would be A-minus. It's a notch below his A+ masterpiece \"House of a Thousand Guitars,\" but it's still my my favorite album of the past year, without a doubt. As other reviewers and I have often asked, why isn't Willie Nile a huge star? It's baffling. One other thing about \"The Innocent Ones\": The photos on the outside of the CD case (by Thomas Weller) of Willie performing, and the close-up photos inside (by Cristina Arrigoni) of Willie lounging with his guitar are tremendous. Bottom line: Buy this CD. You won't be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.019970685243606567}
{"text": "This is my first ever review, anywhere.I have loved Willie's music for a while, and finally got round to seeing him last night at The Tralf in Buffalo. Why this man is not a household name is beyond me. If there is any justice in this world, this new CD of his, and 'One Guitar' in particular ought to be monsters. Just before he played 'One Guitar' he started to introduce it and to say something about what his manager had in mind .. then he stopped. Well .. if they are trying to get him to do video for MTV and YouTube, he should listen. As last night's crowd of Willie die-hards went completely bonkers to a song most of them had never heard before, I could see this video of soldiers with no guns, just one guitar, embracing arabs - Shia and Sunni alike - and all of them just jumping up and down singing \"Na Na Na Na Na ....\" in totally joyous abandon. OK .. I know .. far-fetched and OTT, but it really is that good a song. A total transport to happiness.I can't recommend this CD highly enough. Not released in the US yet, but you can get it from Amazon UK, or from Willie's website.Wonderful.\n", "val": 0.010732444934546947}
{"text": "With the release of his self-titled, first album in 1980, Nile burst onto the music scene, & has never looked back. Immediately drawing comparisons to Bob Dylan & Bruce Springsteen, he was a hit both with critics & fans alike. Sometime after the release of his second album, Golden Down, in 1981, Nile was plagued by record company legal problems, & more or less disppeared from the music scene. The music industry, it seemed, had lost a vital voice & fan favorite...or had it.Without missing a beat, Nile resurfaced 10 years later, with the release of Places I Have Never Been, which again drew critical acclaim, & yielded some fan favorite cuts, including one that remains a staple of his live shows, Heaven Help The Lonely. But it wasn't until the 2006 release of Streets of New York, that new fans & critics actually began to sit up & take notice of this singer-songwriter, & discovered what a precious few already knew...that Nile was not only a gifted singer & performer, but that he, together with long-time friend, collaborator, & drummer, Frankie Lee, was a prolific songwriter. Together, the duo penned some of the finest lyrics of their careers, & created some of the catchiest hooks to date.With the current release of The Innocent Ones, now available for a limited time via his website, WillieNile.com, with an official release later this year, Nile & Frankie Lee, have again crafted another concept album, that stands apart from the rest of the pack. From start to finish, this album ranks among the best albums of its type ever released. Yielding such catchy tunes as the Clash-like, Can't Stay Home, & the sixties-inspired, My Little Girl, along with the ballads Song For You and Sideways Beautiful, written for Nile's daughter, the real stars here are the title track, & his new anthem, One Guitar, which, if there's any justice in this crazy world, should finally get Nile & company the radio air-time he deserves...Having just performed at the Light Of Day benfefit concert at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park last night, Willie, together with Frankie Lee, and bass guitarist Johnny Pisano, can be found touring all over the planet, with several gigs coming up in the next few months in New Jersey & upstate New York. Check them out when they come to your hometown, so you can see for yourself what the fuss is all about, & don't forget to visit his website, WillieNile.com for more info, & to purchase all his available cds.Mitchell Bilus\n", "val": 0.022836823016405106}
{"text": "I should of waited for this to be a domestic release, but I couldn't.  Why this is an import is beyond me, Willie is as hot as ever in the songwriting and musicial performance.  This mostly a upbeat collection, rollers are \"Singin' Bell\", \"One Guitar\", \"The Innocent Ones\", \"Hear You Breath\", \"My Little Girl\", Rich And Broken\", \"Far Green Hills\" and love \"Topless Amateur\" and \"Can't Stay Home\", with his piano tracks \"Song For You\" and \"Sideways Beautiful\".  Hirsh Gardner plays drums on this disc, he is from the 70's early 80's arena rock band New England.Like I said up above I hope this gets a domestic release, but the price is coming down in the z-sellers.\n", "val": 7.223131251521409e-05}

The Mission is definitely one of the greatest - and most ignored - artrock bands of the 1990's.The opener Amelia is a frightening song about incest, recited by the abusive  father. On the A side of the vinyl album then follows great melodic rock  songs in breathtaking symphonic arrangements, ending in the absolutely  outstanding Deliverance which till this day is one of my favourite rock  songs of all times!Side B starts with a soulful song called Grapes Of  Wrath (self-explanatory). The journey goes on, and this amazing album ends  in the beautiful summer and love song Lovely.A fantastic album!\n", "val": 0.06344401091337204}

I look forward to hearing more and seeing the movie in early 2012.EDIT: 08/23/2012 - I do understand what this is at last. I've read the books but not seen the movie yet.

But neither is Lou Gramm anymore.  Kelly Hanson is better in my opinion.  And like everyone I am entitled to my opinion.  This rendition of the song sounds like what the song would have sounded like had Kelly Hanson gone back via a time machine to those days when this song was first recorded.  It has the common restrained sound of the Columbia Records (or similar labels) of 1970s under the control of the likes of engineer who mastered the original Journey albums with Steve Perry.  Like Steve Perry of the 1970s, Kelly Hanson's voice sounds like it should for studio master recordings.  Studio is never meant to sound like live.  Some people seem to want what they had in Lou Gramm.  He's still there in the original recordings.  I was never of the mind that a song can only be recorded by one person and one person alone.  Sure, I love Lou Gramm same as anyone else.  He recorded the soundtrack of my early high school years.  But it is very nice to hear Kelly Hanson sing these songs.  And to know that when I am going to sit next to someone at the modern concerts they may possibly have heard Kelly sing these songs and hear the voice that they recognize.  A voice that sounds amazing when unrestrained and allowed to soar at concerts.  And I for one, among many, many, many others love it when the voice that will sing at the concerts is the voice you hear in the concert commercials.  Bravo Foreigner for keeping the band alive.  Bravo Kelly Hanson for doing a fine job with vocals. And bravo once again to Lou Gramm for giving us vocals to songs that we want to hear over and over again until we die.  Lou lit the torch for Foreigner and Kelly made it brighter keeping it lit Saturday night.  Rock on Foreigner.\n", "val": 0.01480985525995493}

Many diverse musical styles are represented on the CD including artists such as Willie Nelson, Shawn Colvin and Edie Brickell.  After enjoying great lyrics and remixes of these songs I also suggest purchasing Sara Hickman's recordings as well as she injects great emotion and humor and intelligence into her performances.

{"text": "What makes Sara Hickman's \"The Best of Times\" unique in the vast sea of tribute albums is that she organized the tribute herself. But, this is not a trip down ego-lane for the 2010 Official State Musician of Texas (an honor bestowed to Willie Nelson in 2009 and Lyle Lovett in 2011) but an ambitious project designed to raise funds and awareness for the Theatre Action Project, an non-profit arts and education organization based in Austin, Texas.I've been a fan of Hickman's music for many years. So, most of the songs on the CD are familiar to me. Therein lies the problem with any tribute album. A cover of the song that is too faithful is boring, but an interpretation that takes too many liberties stops reminding of why you like the song in the first place. Finding the right balance is not easy, which is why so many tribute albums fail. But, more often than not, the artists covering these songs put enough of their stamp on them to make you appreciate both the song and the artist in a new way. Some songs are so perfectly matched to the artist, such as Edie Brickell and \"Shadowboxing\" and Marsha Ball and \"Strong Woman\", that you wonder why no one thought of pairing the two together before. There are a few head-scratchers, \"Kayaking\" by the White Ghost Shivers and \"I Wear the Crown\" by Sarah Fox and Joel Guzman desperately need a dose of the fun and humor Hickman brought to the originals. But, they are far outweighed by the outstanding partnerships between song and singer that dominate this two-disc set. Oh, and opening and closing the set with two versions of \"Simply\" (one by Willie Nelson and the other by Brave Combo) is a masterstroke.I highly recommend this to any fan of Hickman's or of Texas music in general. Plus, money from raised from the sale of the CDs goes to a very worthy cause. Her liner notes about the project are one of the highlights of the collection.

{"text": "This is the version of this album to buy, if you're looking for it on vinyl. Pressed from the same source as the rare out-of-print AAA vinyl, just way cheaper. This record sounds great. While I didn't do an A/B comparison with the original Howie Weinberg-mastered CD, I know how it sounds pretty well, and while this record is a great pressing and mastering job, the original CD had a certain aggressive coolness in the mastering that's not totally here in the vinyl. Not to say the CD sounds better, but the original CD is what played on the radio and MTV and what captivated the world, and this vinyl is, well, a remastered version with a little less energy than the original (it's subtle). Totally worth owning though, and Geffen should be applauded for making all-analog remasters available at an affordable price -- but why in the world do they not mention AAA mastering on the label anywhere?!?! That's sort of the whole reason to buy a remaster...no idea what the marketing guys at DGC were thinking.\n", "val": 0.00031490903347730637}

{"text": "Those who argue that Nevermind is one of the greatest albums of all time do so on the basis that it changed and defined music, single handedly, for the first five years of the 1990s. You would be hard pressed to find a single album that has done so before or since. The impact that the ultimately doomed Seattle trio made, over just seven years, makes Nirvana one of rocks most successful artists.Nevermind begins with Nirvanas signature track: Smells Like Teen Spirit, which Rolling Stone Magazine ranks at #9 in its 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time for its influence and lyrics about the social pressures and anxieties faced in adolescence with a massive chorus:With the lights out, its less dangerousHere we are now, entertain usI feel stupid, and contagiousHere we are now, entertain us!The aggressive, four powerchord opening echoed down the line of the early 90s, being sampled by many imitating artists.Nevermind was never meant to be as huge on the pop scene as it was. Kurt Cobain worried that his grunge credibility would be threatened. His gloom was increased when Smells Like Teen Spirit, which he didn't feel was anywhere near his best lyrical effort, was demanded at concerts. Ultimately, Cobains fractured, unbearable youth would provide the lyrical structure for much of Nevermind: Smells Like Teen Spirit, the anti-judgemental Come As You Are, the chilling Polly, the characterised denial and confusion of On A Plain and the heartbreaking Something In The Way all have evidence of a troubled, anguished childhood and the terrible inner turmoil that was, sadly, never too far under the surface.However, not all of Nevermind is a collection of underlying teenage unrest by an alternatively brilliant, damaged young man. The frenzied shred of Breed and Territorial Pissings are music as a party drug, the latter being most enjoyable when control is thrown out the window, Cobains voice cracks and the song smashes through logical structure of music.In Bloom, with its blaring riff and murmured, boiling verses, would become a fan favourite and a radio staple, as would Come As You Are.Cobain loved Drain You, which is brash, faintly repulsive yet somehow un-put-down-able. The clean cut, cynical Lithium is Cobains lyric writing at its best on the album, with wry, almost funny one liners turning personal slights into rebound attacks:Im so ugly?/ Thats OK, cause so are you!Polly, an acoustic about the rape of a young girl, is hard to listen to too often, especially with the lineLet me clip your dirty wings.Ultimately, what makes the album is the final track Something In The Way. After the pounding and thundering of the first eleven songs, its soft, quiet desperation stands out a mile. The depressing lyrics, about Cobain living under a bridge as a young man, are graceful and poignant, with a mournfully beautiful cello playing over the chorus. A stand out.Nevermind is difficult to fully judge. The music is more than a classic of its genre; it is the genre. The lyrics, while at times unpleasant, fit perfectly with the sound. The disillusion that Cobain felt following its success makes it tragic.If you look at it in a purely music relevance sense, it is a classic, and arguably the most influential album of all time.\n", "val": 0.0015331503236666322}

I do feel like some others have said that the guitars, drum and bass are a bit squashed with lots of compression.  They did that to bring the vocals out.  The instruments just don't breath like I'd like them to.  However it was an interesting listen and as I have a Japan import and this was a limited run it may increase in value a bit down the line.  I will be interested in hearing the reissue vinyl, hopefully it has a more natural feel.  Sometimes on vinyl I can imagine a record like this getting pretty muddy on the clarity side of things.  But on a record like this that is more about the raw feeling and artistry the bluray lacks a natural character to the instruments and the guitars.  They should sound huge and fat that's how I remember this album.  Here they feel a little thinned out and squashed.\n", "val": 6.221896910574287e-05}

{"text": "The album is amazing. Obviously. It's one of the most widely acclaimed albums of all time for a reason. You know it. You love it. I'll save us time and skip the review of the music.So about the remastering and the volume thing...The vocals are brought up a bit and the band is brought down a tad. This keeps the vocals from being totally overpowered by the music. The end result is that you can hear Kurt Cobain's lyrics MUCH more clearly than you could on the original release. Now that it's no longer the early 90's and I'm no longer a teenager, I like this. Nirvana's lyrics were always amazing, but they often got overshadowed by the music, which was also amazing.  I like that I can listen to this now and really hear Cobain's awesome poetry crisply and clearly.However, that makes this sound different. Part of the appeal to Nirvana back in the day was how they just put the music right in your face and made it push right through you. You almost had to work to hear the words, and that wasn't a bad thing. It immersed you in the music and made it a part of you in your attempt to really 'get it'.Since I'm already familiar with the music and have been for 25 years now, I feel like the music is already a part of me and I'm glad to hear the vocals more clearly. Especially since I'm entering the \"Hey you kids! Turn down that darn loud music!\" stage of my life. But for listeners new to Nirvana, I'd suggest starting with the originally version of this album first.\n", "val": 0.028410999104380608}

{"text": "I'm kinda torn on the rating here.Nirvana were my favorite band for many years, and still are easily in my top 10. This album was never my favorite from them. That honor has always gone to In Utero for me, but this is the classic that made that album possible, and there was a time where this was probably my 2nd favorite album of all time behind In Utero.I'm giving a 4 star rating, because anything under that seems ludicrous, judging the songs by themselves. I, however, agree with all the 1 star reviews complaining about the remaster, and if I wasn't worried about it impacting the rating of an all around fantastic piece of music, I would give it the same.I was ecstatic when this remaster was first announced. By the time it was announced, the original version of this album sounded dated to me. It didn't always sound this way to me, but by 2011 this album sounded most definitely like it came out in 1991 and no other year. It's a shame when over-production stops well written songs from being timeless.On this remaster, however, they went way, way, way overboard. Rather than fixing the 1991 polish to make it sound more like 21st century polish, they just cranked the volume up and ruined the 'loud, quiet, loud' aspects that made this album so great to begin with. Luckily, In Utero received the treatment it deserved, but this remaster destroys the dynamics of this entire album.I think the problem with this remaster was with the marketing team. They probably thought, \"what made this album so popular? Oh, it was loud and abrasive, so if we make it louder we'll also make it more abrasive!\" The strategy kinda makes sense to marketing teams who don't understand art, but it completely undermines the point of this album which made it so popular. Yes, it was partially that it was loud and abrasive in a time where most music was very pretty and glossy. Popular rock music in the 80's sucked, and this album was the perfect gut punch to get culture away from the dumb hair bands and pop songs that dominated the decade (not that all 80's music was bad... rock certainly was pretty bad, unless you were listening to hardcore punk, but some of the New Wave and Synth pop was quite excellent, and really paved the way for a lot of today's great Indie bands)However, the point of this album, and the thing that made it such a hit, was it's Pixies formula. It was the dynamics. Moments of hushed tones waiting to be shredded to bits by a roaring chorus. The song structures in this album are very basic pop, and not terribly impressive (though, melodically very impressive), but it was the dynamics of this album that made it a classic. Turning up the volume the way they did just butchers those dynamics, and ruins the album.The album itself gets a 4 star rating from me. It's not as good as In Utero. While I blame the production more than the song writing, this album does sound quite dated, even in it's louder form (almost worse because of it). I would, however, rate this remaster 0 stars, and would recommend against it. I wouldn't recommend the CD or MP3 of the original, non-remastered edition very much either. If you want to listen to and enjoy this album the way it should be enjoyed, I'd actually recommend the 180 grain vinyl edition. That doesn't sound as dated, it has the right and proper dynamics and would get a 5 star rating from me based on those merits.I hope that they do a 30th anniversary remaster and fix this crap so that I have something as enjoyable as this album deserves to remain in the 21st century. Oh, not sure if I mentioned it, but I would still strongly recommend In Utero's 20th Anniversary remaster. That album already had a timeless sound, and didn't really need the remaster, but somehow the remaster of that album made the dynamics even better. I'll do a separate review of that at another time, but having listened to the orignal and remastered In Utero side-by-side, they actually turned down the volume on some parts of it and made the loud-quiet-loud aspects much sharper, like I wish they did here.\n", "val": 2.566182411101181e-05}

Late writing this review, but I am bored out of my senses and need something interesting to do.Okay,Basically this album is a favourite among Nirvana fans, as I've come to notice. I think it's quite fresh and young-sounding compared to In Utero which sounds much more \"bitter\", for lack of a better word. Nevermind is exciting. Specially if you haven't listened to a lot of Nirvana. It would actually be great to listen to if you're \"trying to get into Nirvana\". Although I got into them by listening to In Utero. I do think It'd be smarter to listen to this one first, since In Utero can be quite heavy on the ears (lyrics AND sounds), and would be better understood and enjoyed if you have heard this album before. personal favourite tracks: breed, territorial pissings, drain you.\n", "val": 0.005008817184716463}

You didn't even WANT to explore all the bonus material because you feel that you've had enough, already.  All I could think about is how s***ty this band really is, how the drums are speeding up, how simplistic and repetitive the writing is.  I'm astounded that this record went straight to Number 1 but such was the flavor du jour -- dismal..

{"text": "Nirvana's Never Mind is considered the quintessential album of the grunge movement of the early 90's, since it proves to be the major influence aside of Pearl Jam's Ten and Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger- in the alternative rock scene. Indeed, most post-grunge bands (?) like Creed, Puddle of Mudd and Nickleback cite this album as an inspiration for their music. The album dealt with the youth rebellious attitude towards the American society and politics, personal life un-satisfaction, drug addiction, depression and suicide as the result of these factors. Incidentally, Kurt Cobain, the master mind behind Nirvana, was deeply affected by those abovementioned factors, as well as the personal demons he created when the band was at their highest popularity level. He was a genius with a troubled soul. Dave Grohl (currently the bandleader of Foo Fighters) shows his tremendous skills as a drummer, while Kurt Novoselic`s basslines are not short of brilliance As for the album, it includes four of their renowned classics such as Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are and Lithium plus other powerful tracks such as Territorial Pissings. Overall, this is a classic disc not to be missed out.\n", "val": 0.020451681688427925}

It's incredibly important and influential, but I suppose that there are younger people that may be learning more about older popular music that might consider purchasing this, so they probably need some input. Nevermind, whether it is your taste or not, represented a massive change in popular music and culture. It is by no means a perfect album, but it is an album that perfectly captured a period in time. A majority of the songs are either instantly recognizable or extremely memorable, but it does have a few weak points. It is classic, but it's not extremely dated.

Nevermind is a true iconic album of the 90s and of the grunge movement and has a wide range of style of songs.  Smells Like Teen Spirit is probably Nirvana's most famous song, but there are plenty of other gems.  For example, Lounge Act has a harder rock edge to it but is also quite melodic.  Something In The Way is slower and shows a softer side to Kurt Cobain, who expresses such raw emotion on every song.

{"text": "I love the instrumentation of this album, very bassy, very deep.  Take out \"Polly\", \"Territorial P...\", \"Get Away\", \"Breed\" and you have a more or less excellent set of songs.  \"Lithium\" is kinda stupid, IMO.  I don't get what his point is.  I read he wrote it regarding the time he spent living with Evangelical Christian guardians as a youth.  The song also has a melody that seems like a parody of children's sing-along shows a la Barney(sp?).  \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is full of fire and life, \"In Bloom\" feels weak in comparison, but has good beefy bass driven production and one gets the impression that it has a purpose, although its anyone's guess as to what he's singing about (again, thanks to Wikipedia for providing that info free of charge!  Not like I needed to know anyway, but thanks!!).  \"Come As You Are\" is a somber piece, with an almost march-like beat, until the chorus gives way.  I used to associate \"I swear I don't have a gun\" with his 1994 alleged suicide (some swear his wife did it), but it occurred to me a few days ago, he probably meant to convey, \"Come as you are because I come in peace\".  Anyway...listening to the whole album after all these years is an exercise in tedium, but if you've never heard it before, you're probably missing out.\n", "val": 6.322047556750476e-05}

{"text": "I am fully aware that there are some out there who will give me some flack, even for an intermediate review on a classic album such as this one, but I really do have to be honest here. First of all, I have owned this album ever since I was in the 8th grade; I got it as a gift for getting almost all A's on my first term report card, and I still could not be more grateful to this day.Let me make this clear: I really do enjoy songs like the classic \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" along with \"In Bloom,\" \"Lithium,\" and \"Drain You.\" I simply cannot go wrong with those songs whenever I need my basic, straight-out rock fix, and I personally think that if anyone doesn't feel moved by them, then they are seriously missing out.As for the rest of the album, however, well... let's just say that I can sense the dedication and effort put forth toward the music itself, in terms of the energy and emotion conveyed, but I still cannot help but feel like I gained only a marginal amount of satisfaction from listening to the whole thing. This can explain why I keep only about half the songs from this album on my iPhone 5.Overall, as classic of an album as this is, and while Nirvana themselves may be galaxies above anything on MTV or the radio nowadays, I still STRONGLY disagree with this album being #2 on VH1's 100 Greatest Albums of Rock N' Roll (behind only \"Revolver\" by The Beatles), and even more so with Nirvana getting #6 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock (behind Metallica, AC/DC, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, in ascending order).\n", "val": 0.0013499651104211807}

{"text": "The general UMG description (editorial review) on how this Blu-ray release was remastered is not true..  this was taken from the 2011 Bob Ludwig remaster.BLu-Ray audio is sadly taken from the 20th Anniversary Master, so the headroom is extremely limited and available fidelity and dynamic range of the Blu-ray format is a complete waist,  I wouldn't be surprised if UMG just used the digital master for the CD release and upscaled it for the Blu-ray production master.  From what I've read  and waveforms I've seen it seems like they used the CD master for the vinyl lacquers, I could be wrong about this, but why else would Bob Ludwig brick-wall limit the vinyl master exactly like the CD master but just a few dBs lower?For someone like Butch Vig, being/been the album's producer who's done all these TV spots, podcasts, and guest appearances, with Grohl and Noveselic promoting this re-release, you'd think he'd want to be involved with the ACTUAL audio end of the remastering job and not just the publicity benefits.  I feel like if there was someone else there holding Ludwig's hands (ears) during the remastering process, except reps from UMG, we might have gotten a true HIFI audiophile release similar to the In Utero 20th release.Hats off to Albini for still caring enough to actively be In Utero's producer 20 years later and suggesting DMM at Abbey Road, attended.maybe for the 25th of Nevermind we can get UMG to do a HIFI remaster for Blu-ray and vinyl.  maybe get Howie Weinberg back too.\n", "val": 2.998395029862877e-05}

{"text": "Growing up from the ages 12-15 and learning to play guitar, no other band could touch Metallica or Nirvana. I worshipped both bands, bought all albums, and learned all the songs on guitar. I thought I was on a different level than everyone else because I could play Smells Like Teen Spirit and Enter The Sandman. After the first few years of learning I started discovering other bands and other styles of music. Slowly but surely I waned myself off both bands and can say I haven't listened to a Nirvana or Metallica album in 10 years. While Nirvana changed the face of music, it didn't last long. Grunge was a fad like any other flavor of the month. Eventually, It died like most other genres do. Nirvana can be enjoyable, but the simplicity of the music I no longer find amazing at 26 years old. I can't relate to any of the lyrics and honestly Kurt Cobain was a terrible writer and guitar player. Some people seem to think his lyrics are deep and thought provoking. Honestly, he was a drug addict that chose to commit suicide. I can see a struggling teenager or guitarist enjoying Nirvana. But as I grew up I moved on to bigger and better music.\n", "val": 0.00023205259640235454}

{"text": "First off to critically review this album after 23 years would be completely pointless and why would you care what I think about the songs on here?  If you are reading this you are interested in the content at this point and not if it's good, because I am going to assume that since you are reading this you think this album is good as well.When I saw that this album was going to be released as a Blu-Ray audio disc I was PUMPED to say the very least.  This could not be delivered to my house fast enough.  When it did arrive, I probably spent the same amount of time examining the packaging and artwork as I did in 1991.  It was while I was reading the finer details of the packaging that a big (!) was raised.  On the back of the inside cover that explained a little bit about the technical specifications are these two sentences;\"Where possible tracks will be available in 5.1 surround, but in order to pay respect to the original material this is not possible for every release.  Full technical specifications are given on the rear of the box.\"I then checked the back of the box and really super tiny above the white box stating that the content is \"Ultra High Quality Audio\" is 2.0.  My heart sank and I immediately put it in after listening to the In Utero disc.What you get here is a really crisp and clear sounding version of the CD.  The mix is exactly the same as the 1991 original, which isn't bad.  However, to me the point of DVD, or Blu-Ray audio is the separation of the individual instruments and how they all relate to each other as a whole.  Sadly, with this you get exactly what you got in 1991, only slightly better.  This sounds no better than the ORG vinyl reissue from 2009, which up to this point was the best sounding version of this album in my opinion.  If you have that, you do not really need this unless you are a completist.The exact same review can apply to the In Utero Blu-Ray audio disc.\n", "val": 0.0005728508112952113}

I recently purchased this cd cause i saw in a magazine review that it had bsides rare live tracks and early demos of nevermind era songs.the live tracks and early versions and demos of the album  are reason enough for any fan of Nirvana to buy this cd again since all Nirvana fans already have the orginal album. listening to the album in the last few days I thought the remastered album sounds better than ever and the bbc sessions from 1991 which were broadcast on a British radio show are great i heard some of these songs on a radio tribute special years ago when Kurt first passed away. the best tracks are the electric version of Something In The Way which has drums on it and Drain You which was a live version on the same program. the live tracks Been A Son live is one of the best it was always a very powerful song live and shows what a great live band Nirvana were . the bides i have heard some of these from the boxed set With The Lights out that i bought but this is a nice sample of bsides from this era for anyone who does not want to buy that 4 disc set . D-7 was a great bside and could of been on an album great cover song also Even In His Youth was the bside of Teen Spirit i remember buying a cd single back in the day of these two tracks , Sappy was an early version of Verse Chorus Verse which turned up on a various artists album. overall the  extra tracks are reason enough to buy remastered cd's of bands or singers.any Nirvana fan will enjoy the extra songs on this album I would urge any fan of 90's alternative rock to buy this album and turn on anyone in this new generation to real music which the 1990's were the last decade of good music!\n", "val": 0.014790447428822517}

{"text": "I'll admit it right away, I've never been a huge fan of Nirvana, but something in the last month or so has shifted my perspective, and listening to their MTV Unplugged set has made me a die-hard fan.  I've always had a copy of Nevermind on my computer from the days when I was a bit younger, and I liked them somewhat back then, but that was before I really got seriously into any kind of music.  When I was around 16 or so, I heard a few songs by the popular, yet equally tragic Sublime and was hooked.  I became a devoted fan of theirs, with every bootleg I could find, and I most likely own every song they've ever recorded.  And I'm starting to get the same feeling with this band, Nirvana.Nevermind was definitely their coming out party, as it is raw with emotion, yet clean, studio polished.  It may even be a little too polished, but that gives it a ton of mainstream appeal.  All the songs are great, the lyrics are very powerful, the subject matter is often dark or simply depressing, but it has something most of the pop community does not have, which is brutal honesty.  He was a true rock star, although I'm not sure that's what he wanted in the end.  He didn't want to become mainstream, which is an even bigger reason for respecting him.  His songs are catchy, and he created his own genre, much like my favorite band Sublime.  He was a trailblazer, but like most trailblazers, all his imitators come up short.  There are probably some worth listening to, but right now I am really hooked on his music and his talent.My favorite song on the album is Lithium, followed by Smells Like Teen Spirit, Polly, Breed, Drain You, On a Plain, In Bloom and Something in the Way.  I love Kurt's raw energy, the drums, and bass lines.  I haven't listened to all of In Utero yet, but I find this album superior, and the MTV Unplugged Nirvana's undisputed masterpiece, at least to my unexperienced self, although quite a few of those songs came off this album, so I would say this is a close second.  And Nirvana is slowly becoming my second-favorite band of all-time, and that is saying a lot, as I've been listening to high-quality music for 11 years now.  The song that inspired me to give these guys a second look was Sappy, off which album I don't know, but it was so catchy and made me feel something very deep.I would highly recommend this album, as well as the Unplugged album.  I'll get around to reviewing In Utero once I get all the tracks and feel I can make a sound assessment.  I would definitely say this is bar none their best studio album, and yet another album of a band from the 90s that has stood the test of time.\n", "val": 0.014857323840260506}

{"text": "I'm a gonna buy the original cd on ebay any minute only cuz I can't find the non remastered version here on amazon.  If this remastered version is so terrible sounding I can't imagine how great the original cd is cuz this thing flys off the stereo.  I'm a like blastin' it too hard in my car for my rear injured speaker to handle it and I can't help myself.  Other thing is I read in the little booklet which is mostly pictures and not a lot of info but the pics are nice, that the Smart Sessions from 1990 actually have a different drummer.  I'm a big fan of Grohl's drumming, with Nirvana and particuarly on Queens of the Stone Age 'Songs for the Deaf' cd.  Incredible.  I was all smug listening to the Smart sessions goin', 'Yea, that Dave Grohl can really drum.' and then I see it's a whole different guy.  Very impressive.  There's about 4 lively songs (compared to basically acoustic ones of the 8 Smart sessions songs) that are totally worth this Deluxe Edition just by themselves.  I couldn't afford the big 'ol box of Nevermind but this does the job since the Paramount live show dvd can be purchased separately and, at this time, cheaply on amazon.  It would be nice to have Parmount live on cd.  I bought the Reading live dvd and cd and that thing cooks too.  I've been reinvigorated with Nivrana in recent weeks by getting this Deluxe edition.  It's my favorite Nirvana album by far.  Kurt appears to have known how to write a good alt rock song, as do whoever writes Offspring's songs and the lead guy for Green Day.  All three of them have a knack for getting songs to flow well.  The Weezer song writer does too but it doesn't quite hit it like Nirvana.  It's really great that in one of my favorite Weezer songs he cites Nevermind as, 'hearing the chords that set me free.'  I'm always impressed with a trio can bang out so much incredible music.  Not a lot of groups can pull it off but like White Stripes somehow often manage to sound full with just two people (and my wife goes crazy about the pedestrian drumming).  What it really means is the singing and guitar alone can really make a band go and with this drummer Nirvana was really able to create some classic alt rock songs, really, as great as any rock song period.  Smells Like Teen Spirit seems to me to be the greatest video ever and Weird Al Yankovic does one of the greatest parodies of a song every using the same janitor in his version of it.  I love hearing them play live doing that song in particular but I was impressed with Stay Away and On a Pine or whatever the next song is called.  They just exploded off the disc and had me gleefully thrashing about.  The boombox trax show what the band could have done and gone and been if that was all they could do, nice, but nothing special.  Worth hearing cuz of what the songs became.  Once they got in the studio proper they really knew how to make real music.  And not all bands can pull of high quality studio and high quality live versions of songs but, clearly, Nirvana could.  It's an incredible shame that Mr. Cobain had that stomach pain and heroin thing and appears to have decided suicide made some sense.  The lost of a musical artist that only hurts.  He left behind some masterpieces.  Working with his band mates he was able to do what's nearly a perfect album, so much so, that the fleshed out version, the deluxe edition treatment, was called for.  I'm a gonna git me the Parmount show now.  God bless you chillin'.  It's a fleeting life.  What's on the other side?  We'll all find out for sure after won't we.  I hope Kurt is in heaven enjoying awesome beauty.  He sure could make some.\n", "val": 0.012456308118999004}

{"text": "Before this record, alternative rock and punk was just that: Alternative. It was only followed by a small audience, and received little respect or recognition from critics of the day. In the world before Nevermind, Michael Jackson still ruled the charts and hair and arena rock was still a very relevant movement in music. Enter Nirvana, circa 1991. The radios began blaring a song that sounded like no other at the time: Smells Like Teen Spirit. While Nirvana's recording company did not expect the song to amount to anything, it quickly became a hit. People quickly realized that the album the song appeared on was filled with similar hits, such as Come as You Are and In Bloom. The album shot to number one on the Billboard charts and became the best selling record of the 1991. Nirvana shot to fame, alternative rock become mainstream. History was made in the music industry, and paved the way for bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden to become popular.That's the historical value of the record. Does it still hold up over twenty years later? Yes, and while it's impact will probably not be as hard as it was to 90s teens, it remains a crowning achievement in 90s music. The popular hits off the record are still just as powerful as they were in 1991. The lesser known tracks are still just as good, in some cases perhaps better. Songs like Drain You and Lithium are striking in their preposterous but effective blend of happy pop melodies with decidedly unhappy lyrics. Smells Like Teen Spirit has perhaps lost most of it's initial impact from overplay, but remains a masterwork of punk guitar and nonsense lyrics. Polly, with its disturbing tale of a kidnapper/torturer is one of the bleaker songs on the album, but its clever guitar licks do much to dull it's bleakness and make it a readily accessible song. A similar vein is found in Territorial Pissings and Breed, which would probably be terrible songs if not for the insane energy found in the music behind them. But perhaps no song is as haunting or effective as the closing track Something in the Way. The tale of Kurt's fictional residence under a bridge is one of his most frank and honest songs, and unfortunately was indicative of the inner turmoil that led to his demise.While perhaps the record has lost it's \"life-changing\" elements due to the passage of time and growing familiarity with it's songs, it still remains a masterpiece of 90s music and is one of the most fun and perfect records ever made.\n", "val": 0.010995112359523773}

{"text": "There's nothing I can say about this album that hasn't been said, contradicted, paraphrased and scrutinized backwards, forwords and at more rpm's more than a Beatles' album circa the mid to late-60's.I count this album among the iconic objects that would bulge from my personal \"time capsule.\" Although I associate both manically joyful and ledge-skirtingly dark times with the songs on this album, it never frustrates me or makes me regret playing it. It's not so much that I discover new things each time I hear it intentionally or coincidentally. I marvel at the eerie, spontaneous relevence, pegging my slant du jour on life, regardless of the particular phase through which I find myself earnestly stumbling. The songs are deliciously accessible, uncannily intuitive, evoking waves of somehow anything buy non-mutually exclusive invasive/welcome penetrating junctions that intersect,to conversational inroads charted by the Davinciesque nakedness of bluntly confessedlyrics and unpretentious emotions. Few other classic rock albums can recreate. Even though this album was called \"Alternative Rock,\" it is at its core unselfconscious Rock 'n' Roll with its simplicity and palpable descriptions of the human condition. Nirvana's surgically accurate capacity to erect songs that neither glorify or self-aggrandize the band members' familiar growing pains and akward metaphysical revelations includes us in an ardent discussion that we could just as easily be having in our own living room after too many beers, tenderly tracing our own new scars fresh from uncautious emotional end-overs. I'm so grateful to have been intellectually mature enough (arguably) when it came out that was able to take it in. I appreciate how I have this relational logistic rapport with Nirvana through their well-thumbed musical photo album and mark time by its advent. It has long since now become a landmark in the panorama of my own chronology and personal voyage nto and through functionalmythology. Far from generic, Nevermind includes us in the cryptic in-joke unlike so many ethereal abstract poets who seem to serenade their own demons with no epilogue or backstory to guide the listener.

Before the fire and lava start pouring out of your ears, let me explain why I dislike them.  First I'm going to start off by fueling the fire and saying I think Kurt Cobain is among the worst songwriters in history because most, if not all, the songs were written while he was on drugs or drunk.  That to me does not make you a good writer.  It just means you can produce crappy noise for people who have no idea what music is.  He was a decent guitar player but even still sucked at it.

Nirvana was unquestionably one of the most influential bands in rock history according to our society, but to me that doesn't say much.  Black Sabbath, Cannibal Corpse, Johnny Cash, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Slayer, and maybe Metallica were REAL rock and metal icons.  Nirvana brought grunge and alternative rock to the forefront but didn't really influence metal or heavy rock much.  They were just the Black Sabbath of the alternative scene, not rock in general.  I know everyone wants to stab my eyes repeatedly with a dull rusty butter knife right now, but hey, it's just how I feel.  Would I recommend this album?  Only to a collector, but not to rock or metal fans.\n", "val": 0.00011933919449802488}

I can't choose a favorite song, but Breed, Lithium, In Bloom, Polly, Lounge Act and Something In The Way are indeed stand-outs. Dave Grohl on drums is an explosive ball of energy that elevates Nevermind from incredible to epic.

{"text": "The album is a classic and I love it. This review is of the technical efforts in bringing the album into an mp3 format.Since the beginning of the MP3 \"revolution\", I've been ripping my own CD's and creating my vast library of music and I like to think I know a thing or two about how to make a decent sounding MP3. But, hard drives fail and CD's become scratched, so I turn to Amazon...These files appear to be encoded as \"constant 256 Kbps\", where as most of the music I get from Amazon is \"Variable bit rate\". The difference is, Variable will dip below 256 Kbps when nothing is going on, but will exceed 256 Kbps when sounds require higher fidelity, thus giving you a better sounding MP3 with about the same file size. If you have a good program to encode with, you can set the lower and upper limits of your Variable encoding to ensure decent sound quality.With these MP3s, I can hear \"artifacts\" in the high tones, specifically the cymbals. It's rather annoying. I should have borrowed a CD from a friend and encoded it myself, but who has CD's these day?\n", "val": 0.00014875845226924866}

{"text": "Nevermind was released onto the unsuspecting music world in 1991 to amazingly positive reviews. Many people thought this was Nirvana's debut (their debut was made two years earlier with Bleach) and some even thought Smells Like Teen Spirit was their only song! This has a far more refined sound compared to Well, anyway, the artwork does feature a naked baby. But, as Kurt said, \"If you're offended by this, you're probably a closet pedofile.\"(4.5/5) Smells Like Teen Spirit - I don't feel like I need to go into this. Literally everybody knows this song, even if you hate Nirvana. Everything about this is timeless. Kurt actually quite hated this song and would intentionally mess it up in concert.(5/5) In Bloom - I love this song to death. The riff is amazing and it has a(n) (intentionally) catchy chorus (just don't sing along, Kurt will hate it.) It's supposedly about rednecks, but I don't really see the connection. The video for this is hilarious.(5/5) Come As You Are - Another hit, and my second favorite song from this album. It uses the chorus effect to give it a nice wavy feel for the opening. The lyrics are very good and the solo is fantastic. This is one of the first song people who learn guitar learn for picking styles.(5/5) Breed - This is a concert staple and one of the few songs from Nevermind that Kurt actually enjoyed playing. There's not much to say except don't even try to interpret the lyrics, as they are completely non-sensical. I think this was made like I Am The Walrus by the Beatles in that he knew people would over analyze they lyrics and wrote a song with no meaning to confuse people.(4.5/5) Lithium - A rather eerie song about a man who turns to god after killing his wife. This is the song that \"invented\" Nirvana's quiet-loud style (Nirvana copied this style from the Pixies.) This is one of the creepier songs to hear at night. Everyone sang along when this was played live at the 1992 Reading Festival. I love this song and it deserves  more praise than it gets.(3/5) Polly - Now that we're out of the singles, we can see what kind of songs Kurt really wanted to write. Polly is a repetitive acoustic song with the only instrument being a cymbal hit at the beginning of the chorus. It's not very impressive and has better versions, so I think it's the low point of the album. It is about a 14-year-old girl named Polly who was kidnapped and abused with a blow torch and in *ahem* other ways that I cannot list here.(4/5) Territorial P**sings -  A short song about god-knows-what. This song has no use of the title, so it is radio friendly. The opening of it is so hilariously sarcastic that I can't help but laugh it (it's Khrist Novelisc saying, \"Come on people now! Smile like you're brothers everybody get together! Try to love one another right nooooooooooow!\" in a weird filtered voice.)(5/5) Drain You - Kurt hated the recording of this, which is why he loved playing it in concert so people could hear how it was supposed to hear. This is severely underrated in my opinion. It was always played second on the In Utero tour. It's not very notable, but it's a great song that real Nirvana fans should know.(5/5) Lounge Act - This is my favorite song on the album. Sure, it's short, and it's one of the only times Kurt swears in a song, but does that really diminish the quality of the song now does it? It has a very eastern sound to it and has great lyrics as well. I personally think it's about a guy turning himself in for his love (I'm probably wrong.)(4.5/5) Stay Away - Originally titled Pay To Play, this is a three and a half minute song with non-sensical lyrics, fast paced riffs, and great rhythm. Not really much to say, but it's a good song and I wish there was one like it.(4/5) On A Plain - This has the clearest meaning of all the songs on here. It's the cheeriest song on here and sounds pretty weird until the last verse. It's about a guy being on a musical plain, AKA never gaining or losing fame. Also about songwriting.(3.5/5) Something In The Way - This is creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepy. Like, really creepy. It's so quiet and depressing at every point. It's a short acoustic song with only guitar until the chorus which adds Dave's drumming and a cello. This is about a time in Kurt's life where he had to live under a bridge after his dad kicked him out. This IS the last the song of the album, unless you count...(4/5) Endless Nameless - This is only one some pressings of the album. It comes after a five minute silent period on Something In The Way and has a low riff and weird lyrics. It was hardly ever played live, but when it is, oh man is it played wrong. It really is an improv song, which is why things sound so different on different recordings.\n", "val": 0.01333324983716011}

At my locker one morning, a friend of mine came dashing up to me and said \"You've got to check out this new band!  They're called Nirvana, and they're amazing!\"  I took a listen, and scoffed.  Complete garbage.Recently, I came across an old copy of the CD in a music store, for about $3.  Trying to change my opinions about certain genres of music, I decided to give it one more spin.  Boy...was that a mistake!  First, Cobain can neither play guitar OR sing.  What few melodies (however piecemeal) he DOES manage to create are decimated by his horrible voice and the remains are buried beneath layer upon layer of sludgy distortion and feedback.  Beyond that, Grohl's drumming is heavy-handed and lethargic, probably to go along with the god-awful \"guitar playing\" up front.  The bass is nearly inaudible, and the whole recording is slathered with a slick, overwrought production that does nothing but help me maintain my original idea that grunge in general (and Nirvana/\"Nevermind\" in particular) is/was hopeless, tuneless B.S.  Worth noting is the fact that Grohl's next band, Foo Fighters, were a virtual carbon-copy of this turd-polishing exercise, yet several shades more entertaining (probably because Grohl isn't as boring, wimpy or mealy-mouthed).Can't help but note that there is a reason the disc was three bucks.

{"text": "Like most hardcore Nirvana fans, I have a love/hate relationship with NEVERMIND. On the one hand, this is, from start to finish, a fantastic album and one of the most influential of all time (certainly the most influential of the 90s). Melodic, catchy, quiet tunes like COME AS YOU ARE and SOMETHING IN THE WAY coexist with classic punk rock songs like BREED, STAY AWAY and the legendary SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT. There are few albums that are more catchy and fun to listen to than this is.But that's the thing-as fun as it is to listen to, it just doesn't feel like Nirvana at times. Nirvana isn't always about singing along at parties; it's about listening to screaming guitar feedback and Kurt's haunting voice, being hypnotized. Kurt sounds great here, but he and the band in general feel \"neutered,\" so to speak-everything feels a little *too* perfect, and I personally feel that this album is the least of Nirvana's three studio offerings.But that isn't to say this is a bad album-even without the stripped down, unpolished feeling of BLEACH, the energy still pervades this album, and you can still \"feel\" the emotion on songs like LITHIUM and DRAIN YOU.

{"text": "There's not much to say about this album that hasn't already been said, but I'm going to join in on the cliche with my first Amazon review.Nirvana's second album, and first commercially sucessful album, 'Nevermind' was released in September 1991. Blah blah blah. It was the little Grunge album that could.'Nevermind' is an album that you'll probably either love or hate. There isn't much of an in between. Personally, the first time I listened, I didn't get it. It took two or three listens until I really realized the magic of what has now become one of my favorite albums.The album is no doubt very overrated. I have no doubt it would be much more appreciated if it were an underground album. But just because it's overrated, doesn't mean that it's a bad album.Let's go track by track:1. Smells Like Teen Spirit - The one Nirvana song that EVERYBODY'S heard, especially if they were tuned into the radio in the early '90s. And although it gets old after multiple listens, this angst anthem sounds just as real, raw, and angry as it did the first time I listened, and it drew me in.2. In Bloom - I've really grown to like this song more as I've listened to it. And the words really go along with 'Nevermind' and it's sucess. It's really catchy, and it'll get stuck in your head. I promise.3. Come as You Are - This is another one of the more popular songs on the album, and although I love it, it's one of my least favorite songs on the album. The main guitar riff to it is very catchy, and the song itself is great, but as with 'Teen Spirit', the song gets weary after repeated listenings.4. Breed - One of the three heaviest songs on the album (the other two being 'Territorial Pissings' and 'Stay Away', which I'll get to later). The song doesn't say much that any other Nirvana song doesn't, but it's definitely one to head bang to.5. Lithium - I go back and forth with this song. I was beginnning to grow weary of this song as well, but when I listened to it again recently, it's really one of my favorite songs on the album. It's really an anthem, and is extremely catchy and fun to sing along with.6. Polly - A Nirvana song that actually has a story behind it (not that others don't, this one just stands out to me). It's about a story that Kurt had heard of where a woman was held hostage by a man, and used reverse psychology to get of of it. This is one of the slower songs on the album, but it's a really great song, and I dont't see myself getting tired of it any time soon.7. Territorial Pissings - The heaviest song on the album, in my opinion. But I like it. Not my favorite, though. It starts off with Krist Novoselic singing in a falsetto voice, and then goes into the thrashy feeling that the song has. Another headbanging song, and also one I don't find myself listening to as much.8. Drain You - Probably my favorite song on the album, for the exception of the instrumental break. I really like how it goes from the almost screamy vocals in 'Territorial' to the smoother vocals of this song. It's just a really catchy tune.9. Lounge Act - Another one of my favorite songs on the album, but I don't have a whole lot to say about it. The bass part is awesome, and I love it when Kurt changes octaves halfway through the song.10. Stay Away - Not much to say about this one that I didn't say for 'Breed' or 'Territorial'. Another thrashy, headbanging song, but for some reason I find myself listening to this song more often than the other two.11. On a Plain - I've really grown to like this song more lately. It's really catchy, and has a really nice vibe to the song. I also want to note real quickly, what's with what happens right before the intro? There's some kind of squeaky-toy sounding thing, and then it goes right into the song. I don't know what led the band to do a lot of things they did.12. Something in the Way - A really eerie song. It's also very quiet, and I have to turn up my volume to even hear the vocals. I find myself drawn into this song whenever I play it. It's a very nice ending to the album.13. Endless, Nameless - This is just...no. I don't like this song. I've only really listened to it all the way through a time or two, but it just gives me a headache. Something in the Way is just a really soft ending, and then ten-or-so minutes later, this comes up and ruins it. I don't consider it part of the album. The title of the song pretty much shows you the feeling of the song. Endless.So, in all...Favorite Tracks: Lithium, Drain You, Lounge ActLeast Favorite Tracks: Breed and Territorial Pissings (Although I like them. I just had to pick a few). Endless, Nameless.So, if you've never listened to the album, give it a go. If you have and you like it, listen again, and listen loud. If you didn't like the album or are closedminded against it, give it another try. It takes a few listens to really get it.Five cool points if you read all of this.\n", "val": 0.001108662225306034}
{"text": "1991 was a big year for music, namely, alternative rock.  The seeds for the alternative rock revolution had been planted in the prior years by bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, NIN, and Faith No More, each contributing classic albums with their own unique, dymanic sound.  Alternative rock wasn't quite mainstream when 1991 started, but by the time the year was over, it had exploded onto the scene thanks in large part to Nirvana's breakthough album Nevermind.Prior to 1991 and the release of Nevermind, Nirvana were largely unknown outside of the Seattle grunge circuit.  They released their debut album Bleach in 1989, which was largely ignored in the press and received very little acclaim as a result.  While Bleach was certainly not a bad album by any means, it wasn't great either, toting the line between Melvins-inspired alt-rock and lunk-headed pop-rock, it was a sloppy, somewhat abrasive album by a band that showed some potential, but sounded too raw to create anything particularly brilliant, let alone classic.And perhaps that is one of the reasons why Nevermind sounds so fresh and engaging.  Where it's predecessor was harsh, jagged, and blunt, Nevermind is polished, smooth, and laid-back.  Even when the album rocks-out hard, it sounds easy and effortless in the process, giving it an accessible quality admist the fuzzed-out, murky backdrop.  It's all apart of Nirvana's unique style, a style best encapsulated in the classic opening track \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".This song almost single-handedly blew the door of the proverbial hinges of alternative-rock, catapulting the band and the scene into the national mainstream.  For such a popular song, it's surprisingly heavy for the most part, but it also sports a tossed-off, slacker quality that effectively channeled the disenfranchised Gen-X vibe that was so prevalent at the time.  Overall, it's a great song that is a classic in pretty much every critical circle imaginable.But what really makes Nevermind such a great album is it's lazy, mid-tempo groove, and no song better captures that feeling than \"In Breed\".  It rocks hard, yet it's steady and easy, sporting it's own unique vibe that is unmistakably Nirvana.Aside from the steady groove that dominates the majority of the album, there is also a fair amount of variety as well.  There are a few up-tempo, punk-rock infused songs that add a sense of fun to the album, i.e. \"Breed\", \"Territorial Pissings\", and \"Stay Away\".  All of these songs rock hard, but not in a threatening way.  There's not really a sense of anger or rage in these songs, it's more a sense of earnest, propulsive grit that drives the songs forward, a style that is distinctive to Nirvana's sound.The other side of Nirvana's sound, and what truly made them a special band, was their ability to create uniquely personal and authentic ballads.  Ballads may not be the best description of such classics as \"Come As You Are\" or \"Lithium\" as they are not traditional cheesey ballads, but they do have a sing-along, laid-back quality that make them unique to Nirvana.  Kurt Cobain had a special ability to sound incredibly sincere in his singing, with his natural, un-forced delivery, a delivery that really shines through on those two classics.The album closes with the haunting acoustic number \"Something In the Way\" which is quiet and spare in tone, similar to the other other acoustic track on the album \"Polly\".  Both of these tracks give the album a sense of solace admist the fuzzy, thrashy backdrop that dominates the majority of the album.  They give the album variety and an added sense of weight.Nevermind is universally praised and recongized as one of the most important and influential albums of the 1990s, and is often considered to be one of the best albums of all-time in most critical circles.  With such lofy praise, you might expect the album to sound larger than life, or epic, or grand in sound and structure.The truth is it doesn't sound like that at all.  It sounds laid-back, smooth, and polished.  What really makes this a classic album is Kurt Cobain's honesty and sincerity, which really pours out of every song on the album.  Not only that, but it's Nirvana's unique vibe, a sound that compliments Kurt's authentic style, a style that would be often imitated over the years, but never duplicated.\n", "val": 0.0024519681464880705}

{"text": "I purchased a remastered version of Nevermind hoping that I would get pristine sound quality that would surpass what I had on a previously purchased version of this CD.  I was wrong.  I remember listening to this CD in a Discman when the original version first came out and thinking how clear and vibrant the sound popped.  I was expecting that this level of quality would reached here with the remaster.  No such luck.  It sounds yucky.  None of the instruments can be distinguished from one another, the volume out is too high, and it sounds like levels of certain instruments arbitrarily jump higher and lower as songs progress.  It sounds like a copy, of a copy, of a copy, that someone made while holding a tape recorder next to a loudspeaker with the treble and bass turned all the way up.  There are no dynamics represented by this remastered recording.  It was very disappointing and I think they should go back to the drawing board, remaster this CD correctly, and then send me another copy for free.  Boo!!!

{"text": "Grunge is my favorite genre of rock, and so of course I love Nirvana. They turned it into the next big thing of the '90s when they came out with Nevermind. It's a great album, and you can definitely hear why it became a sensation. The grunge scene was revolutionary to basically everyone who did not live in Washington state, with a sound that went against everything that the rock bands (aka hair bands, metal, and glam rock) of the '80s stood for and were like. I don't think there is any one other album that totally revolutionized rock like Nevermind. The lyrics are more negative and less radio-friendly than the average rock song, and distorted sounds matched the dark, drab topics perfectly. I mean, anyone who can come up with a song about a girl being kidnapped and tortured with a blowtorch (Polly) and put it on an album has guts, especially compared to the love-filled songs that made up the '80s.The best songs on Nevermind are probably ones that you have already heard. Of the twelve songs on the album, seven or eight get airplay on the radio station that I listen to (although I think one or two may be different versions, such as a live recording or whatever). Said radio station had a list of the 90 top songs from the '90s, and three or four of the top 10 were on Nevermind. These songs are all good in their own right. You don't always understand what they mean or even sometimes what the lyrics even are, but that is perfectly fine. Many of the titles are also pretty unusual and you just have to wonder what they are about, such as Lithium or the incredibly popular, Smells Like Teen Spirit.Favorite songs: It's way too hard to choose, but probably any of the first five songs on here: Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come as You Are, Breed, and Lithium, probably just because I know them from hearing them on the radio and because they are at the beginning of the album, so if I can't hear it all at one time, I hear those songs. Most of the others don't really bother me, either.Least favorite songs: I don't like how Territorial Pissings starts off. It's just so different from the rest of the album that you don't like how it doesn't fully fit, and because it's making fun of other types of rock, it's incredibly obvious. Polly is also a little quieter and less crazy musically (rather than lyrically). I can't always appreciate the sound because of that.If you haven't heard Nevermind before, listen to it. Marvel at it and how it totally changed the music scene. Enjoy it, care for it, love it. You won't be sorry.\n", "val": 0.02759516052901745}

{"text": "Overall, I'm very happy with this release.  I've now had time to listen to all the CD's, watch the DVD and go through the book and am happy with my purchase.  Having all of the demos, the early studio sessions, and the original Vig mixes are awesome.  If you're looking at this product, you're obviously not the casual fan so my reviewing \"Nevermind\" will have little value.  Instead, I'll discuss my overall feeling about each disc, the deficiencies of each disc, and the release as a whole as a way for you to decide if spending over $100 is really worth it to you...Disc 1 - Original Album (remastered) + B-sides - I like the remaster for the most part, but to me the parts of the song with crunchy guitar almost seem to be turned up too loud in the mix, to the point where they break out of the field of a sound a bit, if that makes sense.  Kurts guitar in Come As You are (not the solo) seems turned up too much in the mix also.Disc 2 - The Smart Studio Sessions, The Boombox Rehearsals, BBC Sessions - Great disc with great quality early studio sessions and demos.  This disc is awesome for getting a look at the creation of the Nevermind material from rehearsals, to early studio sessions, to a pair of early live performances.Disc 3 - The Devonshire Mixes - Definitely an interesting CD and I love rockin' it.  There are mostly minor differences in the sound and mix.  An interesting document of the first draft of the completed album.  For me, the On A Plain mix was the coolest of the different mixes, I loved the sound, especially the mix on Kurts vocals and the outro.  This is a cool way to listen to the CD with more variety in the sound.Disc 4 - Live at the Paramount CD - An excellent live concert with a ton of material - 19 tracks in all.  Each song is played incredibly and Kurts vocals are right on.  Incredible sound and performance all around.Disc 5 - Live at the Paramount DVD - The 16mm film makes watching this concert much more interesting than the normal \"concert on DVD.\"  Kurt knocking down the mic stand during a song, and breaking his guitar at the end are cool as well.  This could easily have been released as a theatrical release.  Krist's statement \"White boy funk sucks!\" is also funny.  Having the 4 videos from the album are also awesome to have together with the concert.The Book - The book has high quality color pictures of the band during the time of the recording and promoting the album including pics of the infamous pool photo shoot, with the band in the pool.  There are lyrics, expense reports, pictures of singles released, magazine articles, pics of the music video shoots, etc.  Very thorough, color picture heavy book.So here's what I would say are the main deficiencies...#1 - Price - This was outrageously expensive.  You can get the first two discs and the concert on DVD for right under $40.  For The extra $70 I paid, I got the Devonshire mixes (Disc 3), a poster, and the book.  Give a fair value of $15 to the Devonshire disc, and $5 to the poster, and you're looking at $50 for the book.  The book is really nice but $50?  It's also worth noting Anyone reading this is certainly going to pay more than $110 like I did because they're limited to 40,000 worldwide and have sold out so now you're going to be buying from a re-seller.#2 - Remaster Of Original Album - Definitely wish the original album would have had a touch more care put into the remastering job - minor gripe.#3 - Missing \"Song In D\" - Why this song was excluded on this $100+ \"Super Deluxe\" album is beyond me.  It's an unreleased Nevermind sessions instrumental.  Vig and Grohl were recently joking around about the fact that the song was not included on this set, and Grohl laughingly said \"Sounds like another box set!\"  This 5 disc release of the original \"single disc\" album and they leave off that one instrumental?  Uncool in my opinion.  I certainly hope they don't make us poor fans buy another $100+ set to get that one song in the future.#4 - Packaging - This set is highly prone to smudges and fingerprints and seems to have a horrible reaction to the oil on human skin.  I've already put a few smudges that won't come off on the case and have to wash my hands before handling the set each time.  I ripped all of the music from the CD's to high quality 320kbps mp3s so that I don't have to open it and mess with it all the time.  Also, the CD's are slid into cardboard cutouts in the book, which is guaranteed to scratch the discs if you take them out more than a few times, regardless of how careful you are.  The case is basically the exact size of a square record sleeve but is a little over an inch thick.  If you're a product of the 90s (like me) and don't have storage for LP's, storing it can be a bit awkward.These four issues make me drop a star to a 4 out of 5 rating, which is accurate for my level of satisfaction.  I would never give mine up now that I have it and I love this set!  The positives easily outweigh the negatives here and having official versions of all this highly bootlegged material is awesome to both benefit the artists, and get higher quality versions of this material.I can smell a similar release in a couple of years for In Utero, which I look forward to.Rock On!Chris Elliott\n", "val": 0.06270347535610199}

People in the global internet Nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for months, until they saw the tracklisting - the original record, b-sides that every already has, the Smart Studios tape that EVERYONE already has (and isn't that good) and a live CD that everyone already has. Then they got REAL bummed when they heard it and realized it was \"brickwalled\" in the mastering stage, meaning, as someone else has already explained, compressed to hell so everything is the same volume (loud) and it hurts your ears, getting rid of many aural details in the process.No doubt, the boombox rehearsal tape and the \"Devonshire Mixes\" were tantalizing. I was really hoping for the Devonshire Mixes to deliver, as Butch's mix of Breed on With the Lights Out is KILLER. However, they are kind of all over the place, which I suppose one should expect for rough mixes - some drums are too loud (Lithium), some too buried in the mix (Breed, Territorial Pissings), etc. I wanted to love them, but overall I don't. I do prefer the vocals on there, as they actually sound like vocals and not wrapped in plastic, and the bass sounds like a bass. People who are seriously into engineering seem to have problems with the different sounds of the drums. It's nothing I notice though. Also, if you wanna see hardcore Nirvana fans get REALLY pissed off, Google \"Sound City Sappy.\"In the end, the Boombox tape is definitely the gem here. Much better quality than I was expecting and it has never been circulated in any form anywhere. Really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster songs in a time that would, in retrospect, be the calm before the storm. It's that much-fabled \"last innocence\" period.Now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money - four CDs, a DVD and a hardcover book for $109-$130+, depending where you got (get) it. With the Lights Out is currently around $40 here and you get three CDs, a DVD and a softcover book. Both have substantial packaging. With the Lights Out had WAY more unreleased stuff on it, like most of it. All of Disc One and part of Disc Two on the other hand, has been released commercially. Disc Four replicates the DVD, which again, has been available as a high-quality audio bootleg since time immemorial. Plus, all the live b-sides are from this show, so those songs appear three times on the set - what? Anyway, you can buy the Deluxe for $20 and the DVD for $16 or so. What do you miss out on?

None of the songs have build up (think intro of Dire Straits Money for Nothing) - they start loud and end loud.  I never once reached for the volume knob to turn up a section.  Yes - the \"speed-auto-vol-level\" is disabled.I know the original LP wasn't like this.  This is tiresome to listen to.  You can't hear the different instruments - the voices are lost, everything is just even. The sound is clean, nothing muddy etc.  Just loud loud.Normally I buy the remasters hoping that the remixing is clean and newer technology improves (the new Beatles releases are awesome).The music isn't fun to listen to.  Granted my car isn't a sound studio, but it is a pretty nice 250w 8 speaker system - and I love to crank the occasional tune. No cranking required with this CD. I'll play it on my home B&W 684's later and see if the Yamaha does it differently.  I doubt it - source is source.  Although the Yamaha can play at lot lower volume.I wonder - is there an \"unloudness\" post-processing that we can all do during the ripping step?

{"text": "The good old loudness war. After getting Thin Lizzy's classic Chinatown Deluxe Edition, I noticed something. It wasn't mixed to maximum loudness. Yipee! Nirvana's Nevermind however was not so fortunate. To your average kid who solely listens to illegally downloaded MP3's on his ipod, this might sound fine, but not to me. It's just too loud. The music has no pop, nothing jumping at you. Very limited dynamic range. You can see for yourself in the customer images I have posted. Think of it as going to the movies and everything is the same volume. The explosions, the gunfights, etc at the same volume of say, a person speaking. Now that just doesn't make sense now does it? There's no oomph, no pop, nothing to make you jump out of your seat, and that's just what this deluxe edition accomplishes. The extras are actually pretty decent, and the packaging is nice apart from Universal cutting corners and replacing the hard outer plastic box with the DELUXE EDITION logo on it with a band that  wraps around the digipack that you have to cut through to get to the goods, or you just get a plain little stick on it that reads DELUXE EDITION. It looks cool and all, but it doesn't cut it. I strongly suggest sticking to your original CD and come across the extras on your own.

{"text": "I have been listening to Nirvana since 92, collecting every thing I could, both official on non-official. My mouth was watering over this release since I now only buy vinyl records...but then I listened to it.My main problem is with LP 1 (Nevermind Remastered) - This is the worst of it. Compared to my 2009 pressing, the cymbals have been nearly stripped of their presence. The beauty of Dave's crashing has been flattened down. It all sounds more like a badly mixed CD than a high quality vinyl. I thought my ears were playing tricks on me so pulled the remaster off my turntable and threw on my 2009 copy. While the new one made my ears ache, the original drew me right through to the end of a side, like it always does. The new version is devoid of any depth and there are obvious clipping issues. I'm afraid to turn this thing up for fear of that awful overdriven distortion creeping in. Kurt's vocals on parts of Lithium sound especially bad, artificially distorting. I didn't believe it on the first listen, but after comparing to the original there is no mistaking it. I'm am no expert but this does not sound like it is even analog sourced. The 2009 vinyl edition was remastered from the original analog master tapes. Buy that one while you still can.Aside from this, the track listing shows UME has no idea what a person listening to vinyl records wants. Boombox demos are unnecessary on a audiophile medium, but they took it further and split them across 2 records. Logic would tell you they could have been on one separate LP so you could listen to it once and put it aside, but hey, what do I know? Keep in mind that as someone who owned all the Outcesticide CDs I do appreciate this, the problem is just with the execution. The demos really should have been a bonus download.For the other material, I'm willing to settle since it's the only way you are going to get this rare material on vinyl. The highlight is actually the last side of the last record. Early versions of Drain You, Something in the Way (loud as hell, in a good way) and the standard Endless Nameless.All in all, this could have been so much better.\n", "val": 5.018934461986646e-05}

{"text": "The original release was a classic metal release. I do think that too many pinheads touted this as the ONLY sound of metal that mattered. blah , blah ,blah. in fact this was a disaster for metal as the genre became less and less melodic and well played until it's now almost a nonmusic entity with little listeners. However this release which may have led to metals downfall in some regards was still a classic cd release. In other words it should have been one of many styles of metal on the radio not the only kind and it's melvins influenced style among other groups was pretty good actually.  The disaster this sparked off wasn't the cd's fault it was the programmers who suddenly denounced all other forms of metal as bad and then proclaimed this group the messiah band, thereby insuring the death of kurt cobain who just wanted to make music.  This double release sounds pretty good and has extra stuff , but it does sound sonically different as well somewhat.  The real release is a five star cd , I still say though it's not a bit better than a five srar release of other types of metal.  like lets say the scorpions 'lovedrive'  a different genre of metal , but good stuff. there was room for all kinds of metal now all we get is stuff kurt cobain even would laugh at.  endless nickelback clones?  few singers that can sing, and worse playing,  which is ok when there's a variety of metal songs andtypes of metal on the metal radio station;over half have closed in the last five years by the way.  still this was a classic and should be seen as such. But not the end all of metal.  just one of it's branches that sadly overcame the rest and helped metal ;against the wishes of nirvana , spiral into the pits of todays one note boredom.\n", "val": 0.005173045676201582}

Bands like Warrant, Bad English, Lita Ford, Poison, Motley Crue, Skid Row, Def Leppard, Cinderella, Slaughter, Whitesnake,  Twisted Sister, Tesla, and everybody's favorite glam hairband with one hit on MTV: Great White. They all bitched in early 1992 that they couldn't get a gig to get their hair done.  Sure some of these bands have hung around to play the local bar, I heard Motley Crue is playing big concerts again and Def Leppard is selling out state fairs. Wow.  I digress. The point is this:  popular music at that time sucked.  Yes we all know Nirvana isn't god and the album is not something to be worshiped. But it was different.I bought the remastered edition unlike most of these reviewers. (How does a 10 year old review help if the CD came out yesterday)? Packaging is almost identical as the original.  The waves of color are in slightly different shapes.  Really the only thing is the copyright date and a clear jewel case tray.The sound is hotter than the original, on average about 4-6db louder. I know this because I measured. The limiting is used extensively.  Not the best remaster I've heard as it gets shrill in the mid range and looses definition all over the place.  The U2 remasters are the best I've heard on CD.) It's a toss up, I'm afraid, the original with it's faults or the remaster with new additional faults. It's not a loudness issue people. It's a clarity issue.  I don't listen to music through 1/16th inch speakers in my living room.  I own a stereo with a volume control on it. I know, it's an amazing feature.

I am also happy it contains alot of hard to find B-Sides and it finally has Something in the Way and Endless Nameless tied together in one song like it was meant to be.  It also contains my favorite B-Side Sappy.  You will definitely hear a difference in sound quality on this album from the 1991 version you will notice that Daves drums are louder and more crisp than ever (which is a good thing) as well as Kurt's guitar.  The bass also sounds great.  So if your a Nirvana fan pick up the 2 disc version you won't be sorry.

Everything just sounds cleaner and more vibrant. Sort of like looking through a window that was just cleaned and you can see really clearly all the detail. Sound is an A+. Second, the package could have been a litte nicer. What I mean by that is they could have included liner notes and more pictures. But, it still is a nice package. Third, the bonus tracks are clutch. They include all the b-sides from the singles from Nevermind. However, they should have included the No Alternative version of Verse Chorus Verse. I'm not big on demos and alternate takes, etc. If In Utero gets this treatment in two years you will get to finally hear the definitive version of MV instead of the demo from the box set. That song is incredible. It's on the All Apologies maxi single from the UK. Extemely difficult to get, but I have my copy. Lastly, this album is ground breaking. I'm tired of certain kids just not appreciating this. You have to understand, this  was 1991 and there wasn't pro tools or any main stream music like this out yet. You actually had to be talented to make music back then. You ever notice how a lot of rock bands sound the same today? There are still great bands out there though.

{"text": "Twenty years ago, rock was changed forever when a little called song 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' hit radios everything, eventually knocking the King of Pop off his throne and declaring rock n roll is king again. Nirvana was and still somewhat viewed as an overnight sensation, though not really the case, this album, Nevermind, changed rock forever.This Deluxe Edition of Nevermind is quite a comprehensive collection of songs from this era of the band. First off, the album sounds really great from remastering, not overdone, but given a breath of life in each song. It sounds fresh and crisp and even more powerful than before. For fans worried about whether or not 'Endless, Nameless', the famous hidden track on the original album is present, it is, only the dead-space silence is cut, which overall is good. Now for what's left..Basically, the rest of disc one after the orginal album is all the B-sides tracks from each of the four singles released from the album. Each B-side included live tracks which are included as well. So if you have the Singles Box Set, you already have all these. Though, they do sound better from the remastering. Disc two starts with the Smart Sessions, which are great to hear the band rehearsing such powerhouse songs like 'In Bloom'. If you already have With The Lights Out, you have the versions of 'Pay To Play', & 'Here She Comes Now'. To my ears, the version of Dive on hear is the same as the one on Insecticide. The next half the disc includes The Boombox Rehearsals and two tracks recorded at the BBC. If you have the With The Lights out set from 2004, you have the version of 'Teen Spirit' found on the Boombox Rehearsals. All of them sound rough around the edges, but it's a real treat to hear the early orgins of these soon-to-be classics. The last two tracks, BBC recordings, are great, particularly Something In The Way, performed electric, sounds absolutely amazing.If you sprung for the four-disc set, disc three is The Devonshire Mixes, which from what I've heard is the same as the Butch Vig mixes, which are nice if you're a big fan, but not really essential. Not too much of a difference, but it is noticeable. Polly is not included for some reason though. Disc four is the CD of Live at the Paramount from 10/31/91, and it is a great show. I can say thankfully, no added audience noise was added to the beginning of any of the tracks like on the Reading CD. The sound quality is excellent and is a great show of the era of the band.So, with that in mind, is it worth it? If you don't have either the Singles Box set or With the Lights Out, I'd say a must, not only for the tracks but for the remastering as well. If you have either/or, yes and no, depending on the level of a fan you are, and if you care about remastering or not. For the four-disc set, I'd say only for the most hard-core fans, you can buy the Paramount DVD separately or download the show or the Devonshire Mixes off Itunes or Amazon MP3. Overall, a great set to celebrate a milestone album in rock.\n", "val": 0.04759359732270241}

I liked \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and \"Come As You Are\", but that was about it.  All I knew was that within a year, girls started wearing flannel shirts and combing their hair straight, and all of the guys quit trying to learn \"Eruption\" on their guitars and started bashing out distorted power chords.  I didn't like Nirvana (or any of the \"grunge\" bands) very much when they first came out, but as time went on, I really began to understand just how important they were to rock music.  They changed everything.  Hair bands were never really that cool, and for the better part of 10 years, we were stuck with pointy guitars, Marshall stacks, and boys that dressed up like girls.  Some of the music, like Guns 'n Roses, was very good, but most of it was over-the-top, cheesy and wasn't really anything any common person could relate to.  When Kurt Cobain's distorted power chords first shot out of our speakers, we knew that something different was happening.  Most of us didn't know what the lyrics were, and we didn't care.  Rock music was taken out of the coke-infused culture of '80's Los Angeles, and put back in the hands of common people everywhere.  No more spandex, no more Aqua Net, and no more two-handed tapping guitar solos on every video that MTV played.  I help out with the youth group band at my church, and kids who weren't even born until after Kurt's death love Nirvana.  Those are the riffs that they're always playing when I walk into the practice room.  Nirvana is still cool, and rightfully so.

This is for the sake of Amazon customers who just want to know whether its good music (which it is!) or not and don't care about musical politics.This album is superb. A roaring Rock masterpiece that pleases from beginning to end. Nevermind kicks off with the infectious and rebellious riff of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and continues with the quiet verse, loud chorus from there. Strangely many of the songs are both highly melodic and hard-edged, carrying an elegant pop melody complimented with a blazing, punk infused guitar accompaniment. The rhythm section also shines through with a thumping melodic bass and powerful drums. Lyrically, the songs can be difficult to understand. Cobain chooses to write with lyrical abstraction, combining seemingly unconnected lines that all contribute to a main theme. Most of the songs do not contain a narrative, so don't hurt yourself trying to look for one. Overall, an impressive album recommended for those who love Alternative music, Rock music or just anyone in general.\n", "val": 0.09428323805332184}

{"text": "For those of you who want a review of the vinyl quality, skip the next paragraph.Nirvana, the band that knocked a pedophile off the top of the Billboard charts.  It seems that only people who were teens in the 1990's understand how important Nirvana were to music.  On either side of that decade you have the coked up 80s where people seemed to have deluded themselves into believing everything was great.  Those of you who feel the 80s were great, go read about the 80s now.  Our president put us in a hole so deep we still have dug our way out, the party scene of the 80s launched an AIDS epidemic in the US, and junkies landed a deathblow on the war on drugs with their cocaine fueled binges.  While this isn't the only problems that went without notice, they were some big ones.  Looking to the decade following Nirvana, music became a joke.  We have shows that find the new \"idols,\" music that is built from the ground up for commercial appeal rather than artistic merit and lyrical content, and a rebirth of boybands.  We ended up in wars that we didn't belong in, an idiot coke fiend for a president, and the budget surplus built by the Clinton administration was shot to hell.  Now, I know the 90s were \"depressing\" to quote, well lots of reviews here, but they were real, not ruled by drug induced hazes and rose colored glasses and not ruled by fear of \"terrorists.\"  I really didn't want this review to turn into this kind of speech but seeing the ridiculous things that some of these reviewers believe was just a bit much.As for the quality of the vinyl in question.  It says in the information section that the record is 120g vinyl but it doesn't seem to match up to the quality of other 120g vinyls i have.  The quality of the sound is good but I'm betting it will wear closer to that of one of my 85g \"yard sale specials.\"  If you truly want to get the album as a collector, try to find the original release colored vinyls.  I ended up buying one of the originals and found it to be much better quality.  However, the sound on this copy of the vinyl is still far superior to that of digital or compact disc if you have a decent turntable.  For those of you with just mediocre or low quality turn tables, get the cd, you won't hear a difference with this particular pressing.  The packaging is standard and includes most of what is in the CD booklet.  The artwork is no different.  Only those who have superior quality turntables will really hear a difference in vinyl and people who use them will most likely want to avoid purchase of this pressing.Final Verdict:  Great music, decent sound on the vinyl, low quality material used, buy the CD instead of this pressing or buy the original pressings for a bit more money and a ton better quality.\n", "val": 0.00018660146452020854}

{"text": "Note: The album does contain a few curse words (specifically In Bloom and Lounge Act) so be mindful when playing this around children.Nirvana's Nevermind has much more gloss and sheen in comparison to their previous Bleach and future In Utero.  While Kurt may have hated the production, the production helps emphasize the strengths of the songs more often than not.With that said, the album itself is not perfect although it should be considered a strong addition to any collection.01 Smells Like Teen Spirit: While it has definitely become overplayed and is a rip off of The Pixies (admitted as much by Cobain), the guitar riff is one of the most memorable that Kurt ever applied to a song.  The drums manage to create a sense of urgency to the track and Kurt's vocals manage to stand out for their underrated sense of melody even with the screamed choruses.02 In Bloom: Memorable contribution from Krist's bass is seen here and a much poppier guitar sound accompanies.  The vocals suit Kurt much better and the song arguably is one of the band's best overall.03 Come As You Are: Another song weighed heavily on Krist's bass line, a feature of the band often under remarked upon. While another rip off (a Killing Joke song), it is mostly memorable for the watery feel of the bass and guitar.  Probably the weakest of the hit songs in my eyes although the lyrics match up well to Kurt's other compositions.04 Breed: One of the songs on the album that best represented Kurt's idea of what he wanted Nirvana to sound like. Punk sound with the heavily distorted guitar, fast drum tempo, and repetitive lyrics coupled with a very catchy chorus.  The song that is likely most representative of what was to come with In Utero.05 Lithium: Another mellow song carried by a memorable bass riff from Krist. Very similar to In Bloom in that Kurt had a real knack for coming up with mid tempo songs that fit his vocals really well. Dave's drumming on this track again adds a sense of urgency when it kicks into high gear.06 Polly: Haunting for the lyrical content although overall, the song does not stand up in comparison to some of the other tracks on the album. The acoustic guitar stands out, especially given when the album was released, but Nirvana would go on to compile better acoustic songs on In Utero and their performance on MTV's Unplugged.07 Territorial Pissings: One of Nirvana's purest punk songs both in attitude and production. The inclusion hurts it a bit as it seems out of place overall on the album and feels like it would have been a better fit on Incesticide.08 Drain You: Reportedly one of Kurt's favorite songs and it is easy to see why. Up there with In Bloom as one of the standout tracks that the band put out and a real highlight of the album. The bass guitar and lyrics are some of the best that Krist and Kurt ever came up with.09 Lounge Act: A personal favorite. A memorable jangly riff with a bit of a punk undertone threatening to break at any point. One of Kurt's best vocal performances ever and the way he pushes himself towards the end is spine chilling.10 Stay Away: Somewhat overlooked track but very similar in relation to Breed. The guitar riff and drums stand out but the lyrical content is not nearly as strong and the song itself feels like a retread of the much better Breed featured earlier. Another track that feels almost out of place on the album in comparison to the tracks around it.11 On A Plain: An often overlooked gem that again compares very favorably to songs like In Bloom and Drain You. One of Kurt's more memorable choruses and Krist's bass stands out as well. One of the top tracks on the album.12 Something In the Way: A slightly better acoustic effort from Kurt with whispered vocals that make the song stand out more than it would have if performed with an electric guitar. The mood and atmosphere of the song are haunting, especially with the cello inclusion, although the drums seem out of place and detract a bit. Good song but it seems to just be missing something to push it over the top.\n", "val": 0.027335740625858307}

Nirvana's true calling was MTV music videos, selling out stadiums and forever having songs for teenage boys to play on guitar, and that's why they're so great! \"Nevermind\" is not only full of catchy songs with angst-ridden lyrics, but Nirvana ended up having a lot of cool t-shirts sold at Hot Topic, so it's win-win.

{"text": "Nevermind wasn't a 90s sensation for no reason. Kurt Cobain's obscurity to his lyrics is what made Nevermind the gem that it is. I understand if you don't appreciate his voice, or simple guitar riffs, or grunge/alternative in general, but the songs were obscure, carefully crafted pieces that made people see that you didn't have to be a rock star to make fantastic music.I feel one of the biggest reasons people criticize this album so readily is because they don't understand the rhetoric each song is using, therefore they don't understand the true meaning, resulting in a confused listener who hears random words and thinks, \"this makes no sense\". The metaphors he uses in the album are nothing short of amazing. A perfect example of this is \"Polly\", which describes a woman who held against her will and raped, using the parrot analogy to describe her imprisoned (caged) condition.Aside from brilliant metaphors and word play, Nirvana keeps the songs at a level of simplicity that is approachable musically. Simple guitar riffs with Krist Novoselic's well timed bass and Dave Grohl's tight drumming keep Cobain's brainchild carefully knitted into an album that reminds us of childhood and helps us realize we're not the only ones who see problems with the way the world was and still is.Nevermind was a breakthrough in that it gave us songs to listen to that had a serious artistic goal planned. I understand Kurt Cobain was not the most talented vocalist or guitarist and Nirvana was not the most talented band ever, but this album introduced us to a different side of music and rock that is rare to find in any previous or current artist. From the baby penis to the paper-thin vocals, Nirvana showed us that vanity and being radio-friendly is not what music is about, but rather being real in a desire to just rock, and Nevermind does exactly that.\n", "val": 0.01977221854031086}
{"text": "Nirvana destroyed kurt k's life is some ways , and in some ways it helped to make metal one of the most unpopular forms of music on the planet. The reason wasn't nirvana's fault , they just wanted to make their own kind of metal which was fine.  and this is a good type of metal, The disaster occured when this was put up as the ONLY good type of metal , noone could have withstood that tag. metal should have been seen as a varied thing, instead we got now it's grunge or nothing. which was the start of the fall of metal, previously metal was a openarmed affair with all sorts of it accepted as valid from melodic , to pop metal to thrash you name it.  then the pinheads touted this as the answer, not only as the answer to metal but also a social answer! (heroin ethos?)  and that was a death sentence for metal. I like this cd , it's good alt metal but it's no better than other types of metal and it wasn't the answer. In fact after this all other types of metal were squashed , grunge lasted a few years and then we were in a situation of now it must be very hard or thrashy or nothing, this effectively destroyed the wideopenness that metal had been, killed off the format to most of the world and then laid waste to listenership completely. bad radio stations like colorado spring's kilo helped this disaster and bear the blame as well. why?, that was the station that for a while set the standard. So this should have been seen as a decent metal cd of it's own brand and put up alongside the many other types of metal including what was popular at the time, instead it was the answer to the end of a genres popularity in the long run. Still metal fans should enjoy this one because it's a good metal cd. with decent to great alt metal songs and that's all it ever really was , and that's why k.c. labeled with a messiah tag was doomed as eventually metal itself was in some respects ,doomed to be a shell of itself with little variety and little melody or listeners.\n", "val": 9.280851372750476e-05}

Anger, longing, feelings of disenfranchisement... this was good stuff!Buh Bye hair metal ballads, hello.... music like I was listening to in basement clubs already.And I rejoiced.  For a bit.Then the hyperbole started. \"Grunge\" became \"fashionable\" and  Kurt Cobain's the voice of a generation.... wtf?One solid album and he's the voice of a generation?Which in turned begged the question, what generation?  I was 21 years old, and apparently too old for this album to speak on my behalf.It became silly.  Which became annoying, which in turn soured me toward the album.Which wasn't fair at the time, but I got over it eventually....If Nevermind had been the first in a series of great albums, spanning years, showing musical growth, I would have been delighted.But it wasn't.  It was a one-off, a really good record by a band that made a handful of mediocre ones and disbanded because the lead singer had mental problems and addictions, and didn't have the tools nor support he needed to deal with them as an adult.Nevermind was wonderful, sloppy rock and roll noise, with tonsil shredding vocals that all mixed together to really, really work.Cut out the drama, the hype and the sad tale of Cobain, and thats what it boils down to.Favorite tracks:  Polly, Come As You Are, Territorial Pissing\n", "val": 0.0004349889059085399}
{"text": "The second and now legendary album by Nirvana came in 1991 as a breath of fresh air to prove that rock and roll was alive. From the opening chords and somewhat assymetrical riff on \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" to soothing acoustics of \"Something In The Way\" the album is packed with ground-breaking songs that had an overpowering impact on a generation. The song-writing and musical talent of self-taught guitarist Kurt Cobain is just shining on the exemplary and soaring rock songs like the lead single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", compassionate \"Come As You Are\" and affecting \"Lithium\". Most of the songs use loud/quiet dynamics and combine shades of metal with shades of punk and pure pop melody that brings alternative rock to mainstream audience.Cobain's writing style is somewhat twisted and cryptic with the disturbing theme of guns and death raised in many songs throughout the record. Whereas lyrics of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" sound more like a sequence of syllables to fill up the space, the occasional nonsense lyrics could not hide the captivating, revelatory side of his writing. The particular gems are \"In Bloom\", offering an attack on people who listen to certain music or wear in a certain style for the wrong reason, and \"Lithium\" - a devastating tale of a man who, after the death of his girlfriend, turns to religion as a last resort to keep himself alive. The emotional honesty about the way these songs are delivered by Cobain is another experience. As the entire record has a live recording feel about it with occasional (and possibly intentional) tape errors, you get to relate to emotions that are rooted so deeply only an untutored scream will do to express them. The fantastic thing about trademark structuring of Nirvana songs is that even when Cobain shifts into raw-throated fury, bassist Chris Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl still keep the song in control and away from musical chaos.One may guess what the music industry would be like at the moment if it was not for Cobain's untimely death in 1994. One thing that we know for sure is that Nevermind marked an important turning point in the history of music and produced life-changing impact few other bands could match.  -Sain Alizada\n", "val": 0.03445999696850777}

I'd appreciate it.The first thing that comes to mind when you think of \"Nevermind\" is probably the overrated \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but there have been other tracks from it that made the radio, like \"In Bloom.\"The mellow points on this album are \"Polly\" and \"Something In The Way,\" which has a proceeding dynamic-contradictory hidden track after it that makes you wait a ridiculous near 10 minutes to get to.I don't think the big hit is the hardest track on this album, and of course I don't think it was the best since it was too mainstream; none of the radio hits are my favorites either, although they were decent. \"Territorial Pissings\" is my favorite; very rough with vocals and production. Other highlights are:+@\"Breed\"+@ \"Drain You,\" which has the incredible line, \"With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil, you taught me everything...\"+@\"Lounge Act\"+@\"Stay Way\" with its agreed upon lyric, \"...I'd rather be dead than cool\"+@\"Lithium,\" with its indignant lyric and its fluctuation of dynamics+@\"Come As You Are,\" which has the only lyrics in the short bookletI'm quite a sensitive lyrical person, for those who don't know by now.

{"text": "This is one of the most important albums in recent time, much has been said about how it changed the music world and can never be changed back, and other great pathos. Well, that is true to an extent, before 'Nirvana' and the rise of alternative rock, music was considerably more cheesy (or romantic) and was less willing to explore darker more disillusioned themes. They also opened up a whole new chapter in popular music because so many alternative rock bands who's style of music was not popular before this were now able to get mass exposure.But I mean, what, with all these guys with hair down to their knees, bragging about everyone they could get laid with and how cool their sunglasses and cars are, if some little guy comes along going 'I'm so crap, I don't deserve to be alive', well, he seems refreshing, like a much needed change of pace.As for the music itself, it is enjoyable. Nirvana have a disaffected atittude, and blend dissonant and major key melodies with a powerful, rocking delivery. This is also where the band perfected the soft verse heavy chorus technique.So the opening song, 'Smells like teen spirit' is a powerful rock song with that unforgettable riff. This song has a slight 'sinister' atmosphere to it. The other big hit off this was 'Come as you are', an acoustic song that had a good chorus effect. These were the only two Nirvana songs I'd heard before I bought the album. When I heard the rest of the album I was surprised at how 70's the rest of the songs sounded, which I wasn't expecting. Also, these were the only two songs that used guitar effects (other than distortion). For example 'Breed' was an energetic rocker that almost feels like classic rock, and 'In Bloom' is a melodious song that also has a bit of classic rock feeling and slightly country sounding. The raved up 'Territorial pissings' is possibly the most pure punk song that the band ever did, at least it is on this album. Most of the tracks rock pretty hard and have plenty of energy, except the acoustic 'Polly' and the haunting ballad 'Something in the way', which has good vocal harmonies and a cello!On the weaknesses of this album, well, Kurt Cobain's slurred lyrics are supposed to be a breakthrough, but I would disagree. It's like saying praising a guitarist for not being able to play guitar or a drummer for not being able to play the drums. Sometimes you don't really understand what is being said, particularly on 'Drain You' and 'Lounge Act'. Also, some of the songs are a bit repetitive, and wear thin on repeated listens.Anyway, it's an a good listen, interesting, and, as you know, highly influential. ***\n", "val": 0.03276417404413223}

If he were alive and Nirvana still existed in some way, Nevermind would be looked at in a similar way to Pearl Jam's Ten, AIC's Dirt, & Soundgarden's BadMotorFinger.  All great albums in the Grunge heading, but none of those albums get anywhere near the love Nevermind does.  I just don't get it.

{"text": "It's the end of 2010, 19 years after this record was released, and I'm going to buy this record for about the 4th time just because Amazon has it on sale. Kurt Cobain didn't make a very good hero or role model, and he didn't want to. His personal life was horrible, his guitar work was mediocre, and the lyrics were often shallow. But he somehow managed to enthrall so many of us, and make music that spoke to us like few did. At the same time, the popularity of Nirvana branded rock music to the extent that little new has come out since. The bluesmen influenced the Beatles and Rolling Stones, who spawned the great golden era of rock in the late 60's and 70's. During that time Led Zepplin and Black Sabbath helped define the hard rock and heavy metal genres that continued after them, and then the grunge movement hit in the early 90's. Most of the music we hear on rock radio today is just Nirvana rehashed the way most rock music before them was just Led Zepplin rehashed. A great example is how much this record doesn't feel dated at 20 years old, but when it came out records that were 20 years old at the time sounded incredible dated.

{"text": "Realeased nearly twenty years ago Nevermind is still as great as it was the day it came out and now is considered a classic and one of the greatest albums of all time by many, and that's not too hard to argue with if you've ever heard the album. Everything about this album was reveloutionary the cover, the name, and most importantly the music it includes. Twelve songs in total it was the album that introduced grunge to the world and created a tottally unique and new BIG sound in rock music that hasn't been duplicated since or yet.  Nevermind like all great rock albums has a sound to it that is unique and sounds unlike anything else before or since, as on albums such as, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Dark Side Of The Moon, Highway 61 Revisited, Are You Experienced?, Tommy, or even OK Computer for that matter, anyways back to the point. You can guarantee that with every song there will be a pounding beat and heavy shredding guitars and grainy, rasped, and angry vocals. Songs like, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", etc, are some of the greatest songs to come out of the 90s and Nevermind is purley one of the greatest and most influential albums of the 90s and is now considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time.

{"text": "Truth be told, if I had reviewed this album when I first bought it, I would have given 2/5 and the best I could say of it was that it had one a half great songs on it. Not exactly sure when I bought the album...not when it first came out, that's for sure. Would have been many years later, after it had become one of the most hyped albums of all time. Maybe some years later I tried listening to the album again. Same result. One and a half great songs, and the rest is just \"nothing\" songs. So, one or two listens to the album when I first bought it. One or two listens the next time I heard it. Frankly, I had consigned this album to the \"don't bother listening to this album ever again\" bin. What changed my mind?  About a year or two ago I bought Nirvana's black compilation album. There were some songs on it that I wasn't familiar with, so I looked to find out what album they were from. The notes said \"Nevermind\". Hmmm. Really? Seriously, REALLY?? It's taken me a while, but I've re-listened to this album a couple of times in the last few days, so I think it's time to write a review of it.Best songs:Smells like teen spirit - When I said this album had 'one and a half great songs on it', on first impression, this is The Great song. It's a song for the ages, and the reason why people would bother to check out this album. Not sure if there has ever been a time when this song was not one of the greatest songs of all time...maybe one time I might have first heard this song in the middle of things, and heard \"Hello, hello, hello...\" and thought to myself \"Meh!\", BUT, once you hear it properly, from the start onwards, its greatness asserts itself. I love the introduction...not a guitar player myself, so not sure of the terminology, but the guitar lick at the front seems dampened, or maybe not fully amplified. Also love the spike in the dampened sound right before it becomes fully amplified or whatnot. Don't think you hear that little spike on MP3 players...to subtle for it. Then the angle grinder guitars kick in with one of the all time great riffs, and Dave \"Thumper\" Grohl starts banging the drums with what sounds like John Bonham for one drum stick, and Bonham's twin brother for the other drum stick. Lead singer Kurt Cobain does some vocal shredding in this song and the bass line is really cool. However, I do have to ask if anyone has nailed singing this song quite like Ian Turpie has. Be that as it may. Don't mind Patti Smith's version of this song either...way better than Tori Amos' version.Lithium - probably my second favourite song on this album. Has the Quiet Loud Quiet structure favoured by one of their influences, Pixies (well, the usual phrase is Loud Quiet Loud, but I think my way is more accurate!). The chorus in this song is terrific and I like the bass playing in the middle of the song.In bloom - as with The Police's drummer, Stewart Copeland, I find Grohl's drumming to be satisfying, aurally. Again, Grohl seems to want to turn his drumkit into something that Salvadore Dali might have drawn. Yet another cool bass line in this song (this album is full of them) and the guitars have a low buzzing sound to them. The chorus is catchy but I wonder if all those years ago if maybe I had found the lyrics too simple. Not an issue for me now, if that was the case.Come as you are - I'm guessing that this might have been the 'half a great song' I had in mind when recalling this album years ago. Quiet, Loud, Quiet format. Mostly a mellow song with a smooth sound to it. Has a catchy bass line to it and some thumping drums too.On a plain - when I listened to this album for the first time the other day, I placed a dot next to it, meaning I didn't mind the song. The opening track on this album got two ticks from me, and the others above got one tick. On second listen I gave this song another dot. This plunged me into a philosophical crisis of confidence...does two dots equal one tick? In this case, I've given the song a belated tick. It has some nice harmonies and the vocal melody has a sing-song quality to it as well as being eerily familiar...though I can't quite place it. Cobain uses the lyric \"To write off lines that don't make sense\", which may be Cobain's song writing template.Next best songs:Polly - mostly accoustic guitar, mellow, smooth. The kind of song you maybe could have found on The Beatles' White album. Has some child like lyrics again, which, if they did turn me off years ago, does not do so anymore.Something in the way - the intro, as well as elsewhere, features a simple accoustic guitar. The drumming is light and uses cymbals a lot. Cobain is at his mildest here, vocally speaking. Perhaps this song has the most child like lyrics of any song on this album. Mellow track, and features a nice violin part to it too.Best of the rest:Breed - has a Police style intro (think \"Synchronicity II\"). Thrash/punk type drumming; bassy synth; indie rock vibe. Chorus is a bit catchy too.Territorial pissings - has highly distorted electric guitars. Also has a thrash/punk vibe to it...maybe you could call it \"Oi! punk\". Features the lyric \"Just because you're paranoid don't mean they're not after you\". Cobain screams himself hoarse in this song. Literally. Found that funny!Lounge act - bassy intro. Guitar sound a bit punk. Sort of catchy.Stay away - actually, I didn't give this song a dot next to it, but I do find the raspy vocal on this quite a hook. Has thrash/punk drumming and punk style guitars. Bassy; two vocal styles by Cobain: 1) rock 2) something a little more extreme than that.Really, the only song that isn't of some interest to me is:Drain you - the one remaining song that I haven't made a note of here, yet. It's another song employing Cobain's sing-song vocal style. In a way, this song reminds me of \"By the way\", by The Red Hot Chilli Peppers. Took me a whle to like \"By the way\" as it sounded like a parody of their style. Nirvana seem to be regurgitating their sound here, which is not to say that this is a bad song.  Okay, that's my review. If I had written this years ago, it would have gotten 2 stars and I would have only mentioned two songs that I liked, more or less. If I mentioned other songs, it would have only been to note their varying styles, not because I liked the songs.  Has anything else changed to give make this album go from 2/5 to 5/5? Well, apart from finding some of the songs on this album catchier on their compilation than I did when listening to them on this album, I suppose another major change is that I've listened to more varied sounding albums in the meantime...compilations by the Ramones, Sex Pistols, Saints, Slayer (especially their good album of punk covers \"Undisputed attitude\"), and, perhaps most importantly, albums by Pixies, which I consider to be the superior grunge band. All these albums may have expanded my taste in music far enough to find gold in this album when previously I had found pretty much all of the album unremarkable.  Did consider giving this album 4 stars and maybe calling it an 85/100 or 9/10 album. On my second recent listen, I think I am really looking forward to relistening to this album again, one of these days. In its favour is an absolute classic song, Cobain's raspy vocals, Grohl's thunderbolts and the punk influence that comes through in this album. You can tell that Nirvana have been influential when you hear bands like Faith No More 'borrow' some of the band's sounds, e.g. \"Last cup of sorrow\" has an intro which is similar to Nirvana's \"In bloom\".  Anyway, after all this time, I do think that this album is worth 5/5 and ALL the hype it has received. Just took me a while to see things this way.If you like this album, some other albums I've enjoyed and reviewed here include:Pixies: \"Come on pilgrim/Surfer Rosa\" and \"Doolittle\"Ramones: AnthologySex Pistols: Kiss thisSaints: Know your productSlayer: Undisputed attitudeMetallica: \"Reload\" and \"Master of puppets\" and \"Garage days Inc\" for some punk influences on the band.\n", "val": 8.888942829798907e-05}

{"text": "Kurt Cobain wanted to take revenge on the Yuppie, Hippie, jerks, who are / were in constant control over the music of his time.

We are not seeing true punk bands, but emo kiddies; these days are worse then in the beginning of the 90's... Mr. Cobain and his love for the Meat Puppets, Pixies, and his most influential band Mudhoney, would form his sound. Kurt tried to down play his records, he failed at that on NEVERMIND... he sold OUT, went BIG on MTV. \"In Bloom\" was the video showing how Kurt even mocked his own fame and fortune.

{"text": "This is where most Nirvana listeners start because it has the most hit singles and is most popular. And yes it is a great album but I don't think its the best one but if you're new to Nirvana then you should probably start here. Rating song by song:1. Smells Like Teen Spirit (5/5)- It's a really good song, one of the best on here, very overplayed on t he radio but still one of the best2. In Bloom (5/5)- Its extremely catchy and also has the tendency to wear out if you play it too much but its a good song3. Come As You Are (5/5)- It has kind of a dark feeling to it, not as loud as Smells like teen Spirit but very catchy.4. Breed 5/5- Now this song is very energetic and will punch you in the face with its fuzzed out guitar yet still manages to stick in your head5. Lithium (5/5)- This song is very unique because its a very simple song yet it is very catchy and effective with relatively hard guitar under it.6. Polly (5/5)- This is the simplest song on the album, just one acoustic guitar and a cymbal crash, and it is still very moving.7. Territorial Pissings (5/5)- Now this song isn't for everyone but its fuzzed out punk rock at its finest but still manages to be somewhat catchy8. Drain You (5/5)- a very poppy rock song with an odd breakdown in the middle that kind of keeps you in suspense.9. Lounge Act (5/5)- Not a stand out track on the album but a really good one nonetheless (i did put 5 out of 5). It's catchy and becomes very raw and emotional at the end. Its amazing how the bass intro is so effective.10. Stay Away (5/5)- This is also not a \"standout\" but a great song; alot of change-ups in the duration of the song and intense drumming.11. On a Plain (5/5)- This one tends to be overlooked but is really good but its very catchy and kind of cheery haha. The harmonizing is VERY good, if you don't like it at first itll grow on you12. Something In the Way 5/5- When I first heard this I got easily bored of it fast; but now i feel the intensity of it, even if the verses are sung repeatedly. The cellos in the background give it this haunting atmosphere. This will also grow on youThis album is catchy pop rock meets fuzzed out hard rock.

{"text": "I was born in 1968, so I was 23 when Nirvana broke. Not a teenie bopper but not as old and grizzled as I am today. I was fortunate to live in a small town that had a true high school radio station, WBSD, that had access to a full \"college radio\" catalog. Where I lived I could also get WXRT out of Chicago. Between these two stations I got to listen to a bevy of alternative/new wave music from about 1979 on (when I first began to listen to music in my own right, not being subjected to Boney Fingers by my dad.So by the time Nirvana came along twelve years later and \"changed the landscape of music\" I found it to be completely derivitive and about as fresh as my gym clothes were in middle school. I wlll say Dave Grohl's drumming was very good (if not a little too in front in the mix), but the remainder was, to me, a rehash of what had been done before, and without the classic 1990's 15 year old snotty attitude that Nirvana brought on board (and Dave Grohl jettisoned for his own output by and large), was done better by the likes of The Pixies and Killing Joke to name but a few.Earlier bands brought a wider viewpoint to their music which lends itself to universality, and can still have something to say to the 40 year old father of two, with job hassles and a mortgage, while Nirvana evokes the troubles of the 15 year old who gets a pimple before a date. It's less about real alienation and more about teenage whining. Basically it is less weighty and more teen oriented. Once in a Lifetime by the Talking Heads resonates even MORE today, while Smells Like Teen Spirit evokes a time when small things seemed to mean so much until real life enters the picture that is.So yes, Nirvana \"changed the landscape\" by making corporate Whine Rock available to spoiled kids who had no idea what real problems were (I'm not saying that some listeners had no problems, just that to explode as they did they peddled angst to spoiled middle class kids). The 80's were about hair bands singing ballads to the chicks and rockers to the guys, and the 90's were a rejection of this pablum by replacing it with something just as easily digestable. Just add a dash of whining and \"irony\" and voila! 90's rock that was dripping with \"importance\".We are in troubled economic times. The last 25 years prior were a binge of consumption with borrowed dollars. With that explosion of available dollars rolled BILLIONS into the hands of the tweens and teens, and the record companies put out an even greater amount of product. Nirvana was the perfect, over-hyped band in the right place and the right time, and unleashed a cascade of mopey teen rock for the newly minted 12-16 year olds who had $20 a week to spend versus those of us in the 70's and early 80's that got fifty cents or a buck.It's sad because Cobain obviously didn't want to be a part of such a commercial machine singing about teen angst the rest of his life. He reached back and did covers from a time when music could put really weighty material, but by then the machine had already rolled him over. Fortuantely Grohl and Hole were more than willing to ride the machine as far as they could without qualms.\n", "val": 0.003141588531434536}
{"text": "What more can be said about this album, of which so much has already been written?  Here's one interesting tidbit.I have an early pressing of the CD, before \"Endless, Nameless\" was added at the end as a bonus track.  The credits state: \"All song lyrics by Kurt Cobain / Music by Nirvana.\"  This was still in the early Geffen days when they decided to split compositional credit equally.Once it became obvious to Kurt just how big Nirvana was going to be, he forced a contract change which required the majority of all compositional credit to be given exclusively to him, both going forward and retroactively.  The implication is that he felt he did most of the creative work anyway, and he would quit the band if the other members did not agree.  Newer pressings, probably including the one offered new on Amazon, will give full musical credit to Kurt for everything except \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", where he graciously allowed the other guys to retain their share.Maybe Kurt was the driving force behind these songs.  Maybe Krist and Dave did little more but help arrange the bass and drum parts for the tunes that Kurt wrote.  It's just amazing that such a development would occur after an album has been released, which is when most people would think that these issues have already been decided for perpetuity.  After all, he couldn't gather up all of the old pressings and exchange them.  And so, the legend remains.\n", "val": 0.0002883120032493025}
{"text": "It's obvious I don't have to say that Nirvana literally changed rock music in the 90's, because EVERYONE knows that did. GO ahead and dislike them if you like, but these three men created a fresh, bold new sound back in 1991. Nevermind and In Utero are the albums that put alternative rock into the mainsteam (thus we now have Grunge, Alternative Metal, Post-Grunge, etc.). Sure, I like Korn and Staind and such, but I always know that Nirvana is the one that gave them a bit of influence, at least.Here in Nevermind, it's all so engaging. Everyone knows \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" and that it's an excellent (but maybe overrated) song, so I'm not going into detail here. \"Lithium\" and \"In Bloom\" are two of my favorites: both have that energetic and lyrical feel that's found in many later singles in the 90's. \"Come as You Are\" is as haunting as \"Heart Shaped Box\" in In Utero. \"Polly\" is an acoustic song that dwelves away from the hard-rocking energy that's constant throughout the album. \"Territorial Pissings\" is so intense that I worry that my neighbors would complain when I play it in a loud volume. Finally, \"Something in the Way\" is a stunning conclusion to the album: soft, eerie, melodic, and beautiful at the same time.Personally, my favorite song from Nirvana is \"Heart Shaped Box\" from \"In Utero\", but the songs here will always be memorable not only to me, but to a vast majority of the human race.Grade: A\n", "val": 0.05797799304127693}

{"text": "Nirvana is synonymous with the early-`90s rock scene, and even in 2008, their legacy lives on with Nevermind, the album that catapulted the band to international stardom and poster-boy status. For the next three years following its release, Nirvana enjoyed unending popularity and multi-platinum record sales up until Cobain's unfortunate suicide in 1994.But, going past the near-worship the album receives from so many corners of the music industry, is it really such a great album?Well, the answer is somewhere in the middle. The first five songs really shine, these including the famed hits \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and \"Come As You Are\". Here Cobain's talents for writing melodies and hooks that, despite his constant hate towards fame, only stood to show that he was indeed capable of effortlessly writing something that spoke to millions. However, the albums momentum is quickly killed with the droning \"Polly\" and grating (albeit good workout song) \"Territorial Pissings\", which sound dated and almost juvenile.Things start to pick up again with \"Drain You\", a song that, without its Whole Lotta Love-esque breakdown, becomes forgettable in short order despite being so poppy. The trio of songs that close the album (\"Stay Away\", \"On a Plain\", and \"Something In The Way\") range from good to great in respective order, with the simplicity of the latter painting a great picture about the homeless lifestyle.So why do I say Nevermind was somewhere in the middle of being good and being great? Well, I honestly believe the music hasn't aged as well as say, Pearl Jam, or Soundgarden, who continued to evolve through the years while creating music that still sounds great when mixed in with newer tunes. Nevermind is a really good album, but coupled with the fact that it sounds dated and can wear on the listener about half-way through, it loses some of the power it had back in 1991.\n", "val": 0.00018190010450780392}

{"text": "Nevermind is a fascinating, strange, grumpy old creature.  If you think that means I think it sounds dated, you're wrong.  I KNOW Nevermind sounds dated, don't be fooled.  Some just think that\"It aint dated, man.  It's just classic, it's just influential!  Don't ask questions.\"That's absolutely fine and appropriate. But I KNOW it sounds dated, .  Why does this matter.Some say \"well, duh, it's narrow, it's un-spectacular.  It's too loud, it has nothing to say. They're Not even musicians.\"  I think their right, but I also think that such people enjoy their favorite music like many enjoy fallatio; extremely customer-biased, with not much to say but witha  whole lot of work to be done.  But this band is a punk group.However, the latter group of idiots is totally right and first group is wrong :-(  But, obviously, the latter group is the real jerk.  Nevermind is the first album I've heard whose dated sound is  a reflection on its listeners rather than itself.  I say whose, because the album is such a fun-loving punk rock mentality.  It matched the sentiment of society that was done with nonsense-music.  And  in spite of it's affinity to (not for) nimrods as well as its inaccessibility to ( and for ) anal musical bores-it makes fools of those who hate it, and makes villains out of those who can't explain it...it stands on its own and watches the debate boil over time, smiling bitterly.  The record is a born punk, a cranky older middle-aged man in album years.  Obviously the punk's brain is Cobain and obviously its limbs are Noveselic, Grohl as well as Cobain.  People say Nirvana is terrible because they're overrated and are being called the new Beatles. It didn't want to move a million or re-define the counterculture, but it did.  And this is what dates it so cruelly just like Sgt. Pepper-it's true-also has an expiration date ranging in or around the mid 1960's.  It hasn't aged gracefully into a new era, because punk rock is a hell of a think to fit into any sort of mainstream filter.  Yes, It's a guitar-driven record that corals much of its songwriting chops from someone who doesn't ably blow away yesteryears guitar-heroes.  And yet, he doesn't want to.Kurt Cobain was a snot-nosed punk who would much rather blow such people off in favor of outdoing  70's icons ultimately more respected then his -extremely-talented contemporaries like Soundgarden and  Alice and Chains.  This is the first time I've reviewed this album, but I feel it's duly worth noting that Nevermind sounding dated is less a reflection on the album itself and more a reflection on the listeners.  It perfectly connects punk rock senselesness with pop sensibility.  And for some inane reason this equation equals reality, like a new world discovered on the other side of the black hole. Nevermind, don't be fooled, is a masterpiece; the kind that judge you more than it tries to impress you.  Smells like Teen Spirit, Lithium, and especially speedier works like Territorial Pissings and Breed are catchy, but not flashy, two very different things.  I'm not afraid to say it, Nevermind is frustrating to understand.  Scathing lyrical attacks on a reuniting of old friends/enemies a la \"Come as you Are\" hint at a terrifingly huanting and blurred core beneath the fantastically poppy drums.  The beautifuly scarce solo is basically the ghost that crashes the part.  If it was any more techinically proficient or any less, the song would be cut down.  This is the sum of the albums parts, just enough to fool, terrify, and label you better than you can label it.\n", "val": 0.0003425803442951292}
{"text": "OK, so I have set myself the task of reviewing the second most overrated albums of the 90's (the first being OK Computer) whilst trying not to offend anyone and also trying to be fair.  It has been quite some time since I have listened to Nevermind all the way through.  Back in the day I listened to it endlessly and loved it.  It is a great album, certainly a very important album, maybe the most important of the 90's.  However, it is also a very `cool' album.  Many people give this top marks without thinking about it because it's cool to like Nirvana isn't it?  Cobain was such a tortured genius wasn't he?  My friends will think less of me if I don't like this album won't they?I personally am not bothered about what is cool, what is not, about being pretentious etc.  If I like something then I like it, not because I'm expected to like it.  The same goes for if I dislike something.Having said all that, I really enjoy this album.  It is a very solid piece of work; there are no problems at all with running through this from beginning to end, each song ranges from good to great and the power and energy runs throughout.  Add that to the nostalgia I feel, remembering listening to it as an 11 year old, then a few years later when everyone started listening again after Cobain's death, then it surpasses being just an album; it becomes part of my coming of age.Smells Like Teen Spirit- Straight off the bat we get a cool riff and then BAM, the power hits us.  Like the album, this track is overrated and overplayed.  We shouldn't let this detract from the fact that it is still a fantastic anthem, which the so-called Generation X embraced.  A very powerful opener for an album, everybody's attention was grabbed and all eyes were on Seattle.In Bloom- This next track is as every bit as good as Teen Spirit.  Cobain's guttural vocals, a big fat baseline and a great solo combine to bring us a superb song that sometimes gets forgotten, wedged between two better known titles.Come As You Are- Featuring some of the best lyrics on the album and a hugely famous intro, Come As You Are is only second to Teen Spirit when it comes to popularity and fame amongst the Nirvana catalogue.  For me this is the best track on the album, Nirvana's best song in fact.  Absolutely incredible.Breed- Grohl's drums propel Breed throughout the next three minutes.  Cobain is great on vocals, the lyrics are once again very good and a middle eight that loses none of the songs fire and tempo.Lithium- `I'm so happy cos today I've found my friends, they're in my head.  I'm so ugly, that's ok cos so are you' are my favourite lyrics from the album.  The chorus is the very essence of the grunge movement.  One of the best crafted songs on Nevermind.Polly- Not as innocent as it first sounds, this acoustic track has darker undertones.  A slight change in mood here as we have a softer song with no loud moments, just Kurt, his guitar and minimal background.Territorial Pissings- Pure energy is the only way to describe this song.  The drums, guitar and vocals all strain together to give this odd and almost novelty song a brute force that almost smashes it's way through the speakers.Drain You- Another underrated track on an album with so many highlights.  The balance between all elements is spot on, including the brilliant lyrics.Lounge Act- The intro starts with a big fat meaty bass line and then the track develops quite an upbeat tempo.  The vocals show off both sides of Kurt's abilities; in the first half we get his singing voice which is low and rough, then in the second half we get his scream and yell which makes his voice even more gravelly.  His voice IS grunge.Stay Away- `Rather be dead than cool' perhaps the most fitting and revealing lyrics that Kurt Cobain penned.  A good solid track with brilliant drumming by Dave Grohl.On A Plain- One of my favourite nirvana songs; everything about it, once again, fits together just right.  I just love the way the lyrics kick in at the start.Something In The Way- We started off with a heavy anthem but know we end the album on a quiet note.  This is even more laid back than Polly and it is so much better.  A very simple tune with a very simple yet beautiful harmony on the chorus, this is the most understated track on the album and, hence, the most underrated.There is a hidden track called `Endless, Nameless'.  It doesn't really fit with the rest of the album and isn't a great track, however there is some good musicianship going on and a few good melodies intertwined with the rawness of the singing.\n", "val": 0.03998007997870445}
{"text": "It's hard to believe the albums that changed my life all seemed to have been around the late 70's and early 80's and I didn't think that would change but then something happened.  In all fairness there wasn't all that much greatness after the beginning of the 80's - by the time I had worn out most of my vinyl from the early 80's I was mulletized, wearing name brand acid washed jeans and trying to hang with the cool kids of the Def Leppard crowd. Of course I never fit in with them but that's probably because I'd run home, watch the Aqua Net out of my hair and put on my Lisa Hartman album.But by 1991 we had all had enough of hair bands and constant sexual innuendo. Sure, Lita Ford got me through some fits but come on I needed more, so along came a new Messiah and his name was Kurt. He didn't care if you liked him, looked at him or hit him, just as long as you heard him. And we did. But this goes beyond just affecting me with the thrilling moments of angst found on the album, Nirvana brought about a whole movement - I tore those labels off my jeans, I put on the thrift store cords and boots, the flannel and the big ratty sweaters, I let my hair grow. I have to admit though I never went so far as to only bathe by Pachouli but come on I was raised right.In essence, Nevermind became a voice for people of my inner angst - my age, my outsider status, everything I thought was on the sidelines was suddenly there in front of me. The music had anger, the music had depth, the passion was there in the lyrics and in the performances, and it changed my whole life. I was finally in a place I wanted to be. My own style changed, my writing, my poetry and stories, my lyrics all took on new meaning and I was no longer afraid to write how I really felt - warts and all. It made me an artist - an unpaid artist sure but if you create art and no one's there to pay attention you're still an artist aren't you? Sure you are and so am I - thanks to the life altering album Nevermind.The opening riffs of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" through \"Breed\", \"Come As You Are\" - each one pushing and pulling at you until you feel the same angst running in your own veins.

{"text": "I've already started seeing on more recent best of albums lists compiled by renowned music critics where this album is among the top 10 albums of all time along with albums by the Stones and the Beatles and I for one am not surprised.  This album is synonymous with an entire genre that it helped to create and with Kurt Cobain's demise, the demise of grunge was quick to follow.  The man despite his attempts at escaping the fact was a musical genius.  Many musicians, myself included, would have loved to have his great sense of melody and intuitive knowledge of how best to use dynamics i.e. the alternation of loud and harsh with slow and soft to create maximum aural impact.  Kurt had a great songwriting gift and he was able to put all the angst and frustrations he felt so eloquently down on track after track on this album.This version of the album is a treat for fans as it comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve a.k.a. mlps design which although isn't the best I've seen however contains a bizarre mini 2008 calendar covering just the months of March and April, an inner sleeve that faithfully represents the original lp design and a booklet of 12 pages containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  Most importantly, the sound quality is very good as well and there is a bit of a surprise on the last track which is actually more than 20 minutes long as after a long pause at the end of \"Something in the Way\" we get a few minutes of outtakes with Kurt going even more mental than anything you've heard on any of the earlier tracks which I thought was interesting.This is a must have album for any self respecting music lover's cd library and is destined to become consistently recognised as an all-time classic album.Very highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.04214145988225937}
{"text": "Doubtlessly the most famous and influential album of the '90s. If you honestly don't know the story behind it, here's how it goes: Nirvana kicked around for a while under several different names in the late '80s, going through several personnel changes before deciding on a lineup of Kurt Cobain (guitar/vocals), Krist Novoselic (bass) and Chad Channing (drums) getting signed on a minor label in 1988 and putting out their debut album, Bleach (famously recorded for $600) in 1989. Most people don't own it.Somewhere in the interim, Nirvana picked up Dave Grohl, signed with Geffen records, and enlisted producer Butch Vig to work on their second album, Nevermind. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was released as the lead-off single, meant to get Nirvana across to the coveted college radio market. The hope was that the follow-up single \"Come As You Are\" would cross Nirvana over to a mainstream audience. Maybe, just maybe, they would be a moderately popular group.Next thing the group knew, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was a worldwide smash, Nevermind was riding high on the charts and taking home all kinds of critical acclaim, and hair metal was dying out. Suddenly, the world of rock would never be the same again. If it weren't for this, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, and pretty much every other popular American rock group from the era you could name probably wouldn't have anywhere near the success they enjoy now. Cobain was a celebrity, and Butch Vig became huge in his own right - he went on to produce another '90s milestone, Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream.So I just spent three paragraphs giving history. You're probably wondering what the album's like. Well, on a whole it's good. The singles are fantastic: \"Teen Spirit\"'s wall of loud, distorted, but melodic guitars, dynamic shifts, and massive chorus have made it an anthem for children of the '90s such as me; \"Come As You Are\" matches a watery bass riff with intelligent lyrics about stardom; \"In Bloom\" is a biting criticism of brain-dead rock fans with a brilliant video and pounding drums; and my favorite, \"Lithium\", cross-breeds a surprisingly jazzy rhythm, disturbing lyrics, and a giant emotional release in the refrain. And it's not just the singles, either. There's a string of fine rockers - \"Breed\", \"Drain You\", \"Lounge Act\", \"On a Plain\" - a stark, controversial sex abuse protest, \"Polly\" (creepiest lyric: \"Polly says her back hurts, and she's just as bored as me\"), and my friend's favorite, the mesmeric, gently swaying ballad \"Something in the Way\". Plus the pure mayhem of the hidden track, \"Endless Nameless\" (with Kurt giving us such insightful proclamations as \"YEEAREARH!!!\" and \"BLAAARGH!\") is awesome. Dave and Krist provide steady backing and really step up to the plate on tracks like \"In Bloom\" (Dave), \"Lounge Act\" (Krist), and \"Lithium\" (both of 'em). And Kurt's sense of melody never deserts him. But some of it is weak. Sure, when I'm in the mood I can relate to the pure anger of \"Stay Away\" (with a frightening chorus), but other times it just bores me. And I don't like \"Territorial P***ings\" at all. It's bad, just about unlistenable in fact.Virtually everyone knows what happened next: Nirvana put out one album (In Utero, which in my opinion is the group's masterpiece), then Kurt killed himself. Which is a shame, because I would've loved to have met him. I read an interview with him, and he struck me as a caring, down-to-earth guy genuinely interested in music, rather than money. He actually detested this album because of its production, which he thought was too commercial. Plus he didn't want racists, sexists or homophobes buying his records, which kicks total butt in my mind, especially when you consider how many rock stars are racists, sexists or homophobes themselves (or all three, in the case of that wonderful, gentlemanly philanthropist Axl Rose).In conclusion, Nevermind is a fine album - Motley Crue, Bon Jovi and Poison combined couldn't make anything a fraction as good. But there are better in the Nirvana catalog. This is probably the most accessible of their albums, but I'd recommend you get In Utero as well, since as I said I think it's a far better album, though it's also REALLY harsh and noisy. Unplugged in New York is also a classic, tied with Bob Marley's Babylon By Bus as my favorite live album of all time. So while Nevermind isn't a bad purchase by any means, you could do much better. If you like this album's sound, I'd also point you towards Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Bandmotorfinger and Superunknown, Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream, Stone Temple Pilots' Core and Purple, Alice in Chains' Dirt, and several others I can't think of right now. The early '90s were a great era for rock music, probably better than anything but the classic 1965-1975 epoch, and while this is the definitive album of the time period, it's pretty far from the best.\n", "val": 0.018651237711310387}

{"text": "After early underground releases Nevermind exploded with this album on the backs of the excellent angsty hard rocker Teen Spirit - whose connection to Bostons More Than A Feeling has been well documented. Tapping into a vein of anti-hero, anti achievement misery that spoke volumes to the gen X slacker generation and promoted via an alternative couldn't-give-a-toss style reminiscent of the punk ethos the album was also blessed with evocative cover art that really caught the punters eye and was truly indicative of the sentiments contained within - and how often does that happen?The entire package is well thought out, the production by Butch Vig and the band being adequate and while probably a product of it's budget more than anything else the fact that it suits the downhearted vibes so painfully evident in Kurt Cobains vocals actually works as a bonus. Other aspects of the construction of this album (see the Classic Albums release about this album if you possibly can - it's out on DVD) also speak of a well thought out plan. The megahit title track is the lead cut, then the mood is instantly dropped a couple of notches in the soupy thouth interesting In Bloom and the maudlin Come As You Are - three tracks that all have their own feel while still working in the same idiom. The guitar attack is insistant and the fuzzy style of it is so indicative of the underground movement, the punk movement and also the hard rock movement because given the heaviness of it this album wasn't going to convert people to liking hard music. No way, you pretty much had to already be predisposed to hard `n' heavy music to get into this.As the album unfolds further we get the first of the lesser lights in Breed, which can be forgiven as it's followed by Lithium, another musically interesting tune that shambles along and uses the underlying vocal melody so indicative of much of what Kurt Cobain was about and is one of the tunes where his love of Beatlesque tunefulness is apparent. Polly, apparently one of the salient tracks of this album, has a couple of amusing couplets but ultimately always left me unmoved as it seems to me indicative of the shambling pointless side of the Cobains persona.Territorial Pissings is anarcho-punk at it's best. The perfect song for when you want to listen to something incoherently angry. And if you've never felt that way your reading the wrong review!The problem with this album becomes apparent at this point however as Drain You and Lounge Act are pretty anonymous. Stay Away has it's moments but isn't enough to pull side two (in oldspeak) out of the muck. On A Plain - well after listening to this album however many times over the years I still couldn't tell you what it sounds like. Not a great advert for the tune is it?Something in the Way finishes the album off..... Eventually. And it evokes more of the same sort of anger-management-gone-wrong vibe of Territorial Pissings and the title track and as such must be rated a success.All up in many respects this album is a success as art - something people such as myself who actually don't like the tunes much can still recognise as having some sort of purpose whether intended or accidental. It's also successful in that it's been seen as something of a watershed moment in the history of hard rock/heavy metal and whether it floats your boat or not that's an achievement. And in terms of making lots of money for everyone involved it was also pretty darn successful (trust me - it's shifted a few units...). Potential downsides are that the constant pessimism can be grating, the attempts at arty rear and internal cover graphics smack of indie rubbish, full lyrics not included which is a pity given they were marketed as having a message and the fact that the sad ending to Kurt Cobains story may tinge your impressions of the album as you hear him rail against life and the universe. And each man alone must rage against his fate indeed....\n", "val": 0.0003634693566709757}
{"text": "While it both alienated the band and made an indelible mark on rock music, Nirvana's 1991 breakthrough \"Nevermind\" is a rock classic. Bringing Seattle's moody grunge music to the big stage, \"Nevermind\" succeeds on great songwriting and Kurt Cobain's character. Although about 90% of the album has become rock radio staples, it carries an independent spirit. But even with the alternative feel, the album can be loved by anyone because it has undeniable hooks and song structure. Nirvana is loud, driving, and angry as ever here, and Cobain's moodiness is a perfect match for the music. The snarling guitars seem to complement his sentiments. Despite all the talk of mutilation and death, Cobain is truly appealing; you can almost feel his pain. He is depressed and disturbed, but he is such an effective songwriter and lyricist that he's almost always understandable. \"Nevermind\" sounds great and somehow, through all the depressing material, is great fun.\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" opens the album with unarguably one of the greatest songs of the 90s. The hard-rocking guitars, well-toned verses, and Cobain's performance made this song a classic for the ages, and the subject matter inspired a generation of rock music. The moody, midtempo \"In Bloom\" has an innate appeal to it, and the classic \"Come As You Are\" is my favorite Nirvana song, for Kurt's down-to-earth philosophy and the wonderful songwriting. \"Breed\" is menacing yet catchy, and \"Lithium\" is one of the album's best cuts. You can almost feel Kurt about to collapse under the optimism of the opening verses, and the sunny music gives way to a loud and driving hook. \"Polly\" is so effective because over simple guitar strums, Cobain's words are disturbed and unstable. \"Territorial Pissings\" is short and strong, and \"Drain You\" is Cobain and Nirvana at their best. \"Lounge Act\" and \"Stay Away\" boast great instrumentals and passionate performance, and \"On a Plain\" is immediately endearing and catchy. The album closes with the somber \"Something in the Way,\" a moving 20-minute (mostly silent) track.Legions of grunge imitators would find their way to major labels in the aftermath of \"Nevermind,\" and Nirvana would continue a short-lived stardom as grunge icons until Cobain's suicide. \"Nevermind\" is their landmark recording, and should be owned by anyone curious or new to the band.

{"text": "I love this album and listen to it a few times a year since it came out. Why? Probably for a different reason than what Kurt and company intended: I love the melodies. You can have the lyrics (OK Ok, I'm odd), but give me the music. Each song has a complex melody behind it (a string quartet recorded 'Nevermind' very artfully), that keeps me listening to this year after year.Back in the 80's Peter Buck described his band, REM, as being \"the acceptable edge of the unacceptable stuff\" (melodic pop enough for the masses while still maintaining some punk attitude--\"Radio Free Europe\" for example). I think 'Nevermind' has this same effect. Pop melodies with punk energy and full mid-high range distortion and lyrics that even a dissolutioned teenager could relate with.This album works on multiple levels and even though Kurt didn't think this was their best, I disagree with him. For me, 'Nevermind' has a Beatles like quality and longevity to it. (Kurt was influenced by the Beatles wasn't he?)So buy this record. Also, if you like this, pick up the string quartet 'Nevermind' CD and you'll see what I mean about the tunes.\n", "val": 0.01725936122238636}

{"text": "nirvana (noun) - a place or state characterized by freedom from or oblivion to pain, worry, and the external world.grunge (noun) - dirt, filth, rubbish; something of inferior quality; trash.The 1980s were one big, immoral popularity contest.  Never mind the quality - if it was \"in,\" people wanted it.  While hard rock had dominated most of the 1970s, the 80s were all about pop: artists like Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Lionel Ritchie, and Whitney Houston.  By 1980, punk rock, which began in the mid-70s, had evolved into \"new wave,\" spawning groups like Tears for Fears and A Flock of Seagulls.  Meanwhile, rock titans like Neil Young seemed to have lost all the edginess that made them so attractive; Bob Dylan stumbled through the decade, fashioning a couple great albums and releasing a much greater number of duds.  Music aficionados were forced to ponder the direst of ponderings: was rock dead?Whether rock was dead or alive, Nirvana rejuvenated it and brought it back to the forefront, nearly stopping pop in its place.  The world hadn't heard anything so ferocious and reeling with pained awareness since the days of the Sex Pistols, and for a world still feeling hungover from the superficial craze of the 1980s, it was a welcome wake-up call.  Nirvana actually emerged at the end of the 80s, led by lead vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain and also featuring Krist Novoselic on bass and, initially, Chad Channing on the drums.  They released their debut, \"Bleach,\" in 1989, produced and recorded for a mere $600 on the Sub Pop label.  It sold roughly 6,000 copies.  When the band heard that Sub Pop was going to become a subsidiary for a major label, they decided to \"cut out the middleman\" and were signed to Geffen Records.  \"Grunge\" music, the murky indie-alternative rock played by groups like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, or, more famously, Pearl Jam, was on the verge of becoming popular.  Geffen executives hoped Nirvana could find some fame as one of the better grunge bands.  They hoped to sell 250,000 copies of Nirvana's second effort, 1991's \"Nevermind,\" earning a \"Gold\" certification from the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America).  The band themselves didn't really care.When the record was released in late 1991, MTV's late night music video showcase \"120 Minutes\" began playing \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" the album's lead single.  Soon it became so popular that the network began playing it during the day.  The album appeared on the Billboard 200 at #144, and in November of '91 it entered the Billboard Top 40 at #35.  Half of the initial U.S. pressings went to the northwest, where the album quickly sold out and was unavailable for days.  Around the rest of the country, the album began selling so quickly that none of Geffen's marketing strategies could be enacted.  Finally, in January of 1992, Nevermind hit #1 on the Billboard Top 40.  At that time, it was selling roughly 300,000 copies per week.Critical response to the album was decidedly mixed.  Rolling Stone gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying, \"If Nirvana isn't onto anything altogether new, Nevermind does possess the songs, character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio's high-octane hits.\"  On the other hand, Robert Christgau, the so-called \"Dean of American Rock Critics,\" gave the album an A.  \"This is hard rock as the term was understood before metal moved in - the kind of loud, slovenly, tuneful music you think no one will ever work a change on again until the next time it happens,\" Christgau wrote.That's exactly what \"Nevermind\" is: a hard rock, post-punk album picking up where the punk groups of the 1970s left off.  It's harder now to understand just what an impact it had upon its release. Nirvana's sound has been imitated countless times by countless groups (Nickelback, Creed, etc. etc.), resulting in a new form of rock: grunge.  When Nevermind was released at the beginning of the 90s, despite its cover art depicting a baby pursuing a dollar bill on a fishing hook underwater, it was like a generation coming up for air after being drowned in commercial, spiritless noise for a decade.  Nirvana defined its generation like no other, and \"Nevermind\" was the crucial album of the 1990s.To really understand the album or the band, one must be familiar with its leader: the legendary, quasi-infamous Kurt Cobain.  Most people are very familiar with him, due in no small part to his untimely and much-discussed death in 1994.  He was born in Aberdeen, Washington, a small coastal town that looks like something out of \"The Fog.\"  Friends and family have said that he was the sweetest of children, but his teenage years were a horse of a different color. Cobain hated athletics (despite his father signing him up for the local wrestling and baseball teams, on which Cobain did quite well) and befriended a gay student, leading to taunts and bullying from Cobain's peers.  He focused mostly on drawing, and kept a personal journal, in which he at one point wrote, \"I am not gay, although I wish I were, just to piss off homophobes.\"Cobain is a rock god.  He was named the greatest rock n' roll hero of all time by \"NME\" readers in 2006, and he remains one of the most enigmatic and fascinating personalities in the history of popular music.  On the outside, he was a good-looking, hostile, roughly-dressed twenty-something; on the inside, he was fighting an endless battle against his own inner demons.  The thing that separated Cobain from his similarly rude, rebellious peers was this: he cared about the world.  He really did, and he wasn't afraid to admit it.  Much of the immense pain in his life came from his own terror at the state of the world and, in particular, the people in it.  It's evident not only from his many, many quotes, but from his songs themselves.  Rough numbers like the mocking \"In Bloom\" or the woeful \"Lithium\" sound angry and reckless on top, but beneath all the anger there's immense sorrow at the state of things.  The trademark punk madness, juxtaposed with sincere humanism, was one of the most appealing things about Nirvana.Then there's the lyrics themselves, penned by Cobain.  While rival group Pearl Jam sang, \"I take a walk outside/I'm surrounded by some kids at play/I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?\", Nirvana grumbled lines like, \"When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions,\" or such refrains as, \"Give an inch, take a smile/Fashion shifts, fashion style/Throw it out and keep it in/Have to have poison skin.\"  Cobain seemed to be almost rambling as he spewed out line after line of surreal poetry, and though all of it may not mean much - his bandmates attest that most of the lyrics were written within five minutes of their first performance - there sure appeared to be some sort of deeper meaning.  Cobain seemed to be on to something which the rest of the public couldn't quite grasp.His lyrics wouldn't have been nearly as powerful without the music to back them up.  Songs like \"On a Plain\" were simple enough to catch the public ear, but at the same time, the arrangement of the music added a new and very appealing depth to them.  Despite his aim to wipe the earth clean of the shiny, soulless tunes of the 80s, Cobain loved pop music.  In fact, \"Nevermind\"'s most famous song, the inescapable \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" (voted the 9th best song of all time by \"Rolling Stone\"), was Cobain's attempt to write the perfect song.  While crafting \"Nevermind,\" he aimed to create the ultimate pop album in the vein of his heroes, the Beatles, one which was modern and catchy enough to obliterate records like Michael Jackson's \"Dangerous\" (number 1 on the charts at that time) but meaningful and spirited enough that the public would grow from listening to it, not step back as they had in the 80s.  Of course, he wanted it to rock, too.The result was a manic, pounding, rollicking rush of intense rock music.  Bassist Krist Novoselic added an oily murkiness to the tracks, keeping Cobain's edgy, buzzing guitars from taking off, much like Cobain's own darkness prevented him from ever soaring as a public figure (until his death - more on that later).  The band's original drummer, Chad Channing, was fired and replaced with Dave Grohl.  Where Channing just sort of rolled through each song, Grohl was like a hurricane and an earthquake in one thunderous package.  When he drummed, he drummed.  He didn't have the versatility or sheer prowess of drummers like Rush's Neil Peart or Stewart Copeland of the Police, but he could and did pound the hell out of those things, much like the Who's Keith Moon.  In the public eye, Kurt Cobain was Nirvana, but any fan will tell you that Novoselic and Grohl were equally important, the firm, high-velocity support for Cobain's meandering surrealism.Of Nirvana's three albums, \"Nevermind\" is widely regarded as their masterpiece.  Each of its 12 tracks are gems.  It may be a testament to the album that its lead single, the aforementioned \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" is probably its weakest track.  That song, with others like the rambunctious \"Breed,\" or the purposefully abysmal \"Territorial Pissings,\"are pure hard-rocking delights.  The watery guitar on the almost ethereal \"Come As You Are\" is irresistible, while the surprisingly melodic chorus of \"On a Plain,\" or the woeful breeziness of \"Something in the Way,\" are downright ghostly.  While the record may have retained that ghostliness since its release, it's certainly more haunting considering the dark circumstances of Cobain's death.There is no underlying theme on \"Nevermind.\"  It's not conceptually dense or extraodinarily creative, like \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\"  And all these years later, the abundance of Nirvana-wannabes on popular radio have numbed our ears.  But if at first \"Nevermind\" doesn't seem particularly amazing, listen to it again, and then again, and perhaps even again, and to your surprise, you will forget about all those other \"post-grunge\" groups out there and hear the album as the world heard it back in `91 and `92.  What makes \"Nevermind\" so wonderful is, in part, its story: after all, Cobain and his crew had no intentions of blowing the world away when they released the album.  Then there's the music.  \"Nevermind\" is the sound of a band that had something to say, said it, and had a pretty good time saying it too.  It's rowdy, but aware (painfully so, at times); visceral, but sophisticated.  It's amazing that a genre so inherently ugly, punk, can turn out to be so wise and beautiful.  And punk was never more beautiful than Nirvana.Truly, Nirvana could have been the best and biggest band since the Beatles.  Although the Beatles' debut was a piece of pop perfection, it took them five more albums to craft a genuinely brilliant record.  Nirvana's debut, on the other-hand, was a nasty, black snake of a record, far from brilliant, but certainly promising.  It took them only one more album to generate a masterpiece, though, and their next album, \"In Utero,\" was similarly great.  \"In Utero\" is, perhaps, structurally and conceptually deeper than \"Nevermind,\" and it sounds more like the rough, vomitific rock of \"Bleach\" than the shiny yet slimey rock of \"Nevermind\" (a sound which the band often expressed their disapproval with).  But \"Nevermind\" was their masterpiece, a perfect rock record that spoke to millions of people.  If one considers that all this was done within the course of three albums, it's breathtaking to think what the group may have done had not Cobain been killed.So if the band could've been so great, what happened?  Well, although Nirvana was the pride and joy of American listeners around 1992, when \"In Utero\" was released in 1993, the public was losing interest.  \"In Utero\" was an album that intentionally challenged its listeners, and considering that most listeners were just getting familiar with its predecessors, that was a challenge they weren't willing to accept.  On top of that, the public was getting sick of Cobain's seemingly incessant depression and disregard for his fans.  He was becoming more and more alienated by the band's sudden popularity, too.  1994 found Cobain seeking a divorce from his wife, Courtney Love (the public frequently called \"Cobain & Love\" the new \"Lennon & Ono\"), and even planning to disband Nirvana.Then he was killed.  The public went mad.  Suddenly everyone loved Nirvana again, and everybody always had.  They were brilliant.  Cobain was immortalized, trapped forever as the dark, troubled 27-year-old lead of one of the greatest bands of all time.  A nation grieved for one of its most promising and talented youth.  How did he die?  Suicide, officially.  The most popular rock music conspiracy is that Cobain didn't kill himself: he was murdered.  He and his band are still discussed in this day, and truthfully, if he hadn't died such a sudden and shocking death, they might not have been remembered so fondly.Regardless of the history, Nevermind is one hell of an album.  \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it #17 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums, commenting, \"His [Cobain's] slashing riffs, corrosive singing and deviously oblique writing, rammed home by the Pixies-via-Zeppelin might of bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, put the warrior purity back in rock & roll.\"  It was ranked the second best album ever on VH1's list (behind the Beatles' \"Revolver\"), and has ranked toward the top of countless other \"all-time best\" lists.  Deservedly so.  This is truly one of the finest records ever cut, so fine that it almost single-handedly murdered our nation's obsession with pop.  Unfortunately, Nirvana ended too soon to complete their mission, and so we remain a nation terrifyingly conscious of trashy pop and sickeningly unaware of the good stuff, the real music - stuff like this.\n", "val": 0.0026153314393013716}

It irks me to see people compare this album to real classics like Dark Side of the Moon, Who's Next, Sticky Fingers, Hotel California and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Nevermind is overrated.Aside Teen Spirit, other lousy songs were \"In Bloom\", \"Come As You Are\" (should have been titled \"Don't Have a Gun\") and \"Lithium\" (who would write a song about a sedative to combat hyperactivity). \"Territorial P*ssings\" sounds like he was writing about a pack of wolves marking their territory. \"Endless Nameless\" was annoying. \"Drain You\" was silly.Whom in the blue Hell came up with naming a generation \"X\", last time I checked Generation X was a punk band that Billy Idol was in back in the late 1970s. I get down on my knees and seriously thank God I dove heavily into Queen's music when Nirvana were at their peak. Also, people comparing a real rock legend like John Lennon to, what \"The Motor City Madman\" Ted Nugent aptly called a \"weenie\", Kurt Cobain was like comparing solid gold to tin foil. Lennon was about happiness and wanting peace in the face of all negativity and horror in the world we live in whilst Cobain just whined, complained, p*ssed and moaned and cried about how bad his life was and wanting to die and sounded like a three year old who had his toy taken from him.Avoid this and any Nirvana album!\n", "val": 7.599657692480832e-05}

{"text": "Nirvana wasn't ever in competition with the likes of Queen, Led Zeppelin, or Metallica.  Frankly, their music was the antithesis of that.Nirvana was a punk rock band from Seattle (the term grunge is as corporate as the bands they rebelled against, sorry.)  The elements found in this album challenged what was being done at the time in corporate rock (if not corporate music in general.)  Fortified with the most powerful rock drummer since Bonham, three guys write an album that's stripped down to bass, guitar, drums, and vocals; all going on during a time where most rock bands featured a polished sound and image.  Apparently, people couldn't relate to some dude in makeup singing about how he's going to score groupies after the concert.  Instead they chose a simple group fronted by a simple guy singing about the penalty of life.You can complain about how it was all noise, but the sounds they were able to get from their instruments opened up a level of musical experimentation not seen since the late 60's/early 70's.  Frankly if the noise didn't deserve merit, the music industry wouldn't have shelved all their hair bands in order to sign anyone walking around Seattle wearing a flannel shirt and carrying a guitar.Proofs in the pudding folks.

Not to metion is guitar playing his awful this guy cant play guitar at all. rolling stone listed him at number 12 on there top 100 guitarists. that is a crime because this idiot was ranked below some true guitar masters jimmy page 9. kirk hamett 11. you have to be brain dead or completely oblivious to any form of muscianship to think nirvana are even slightly good. perhaps ive been spoiled by GOOD music. but i just thought this cd was laughable and an insult to good music of any kind. if you're looking for good music might i point you in the direction of these albums instead.Metalica master of puppetsled zepplin physical grafitiled zepplin ivjimi hendrix are you experinced?bob dylan blood on the tracksquenn greatest hitsmetalica black albummetalica ride the lightningquenn a night at the opera\n", "val": 2.5905132133630104e-05}

Everyone on here over analyzes this album because they feel that they have to \"set the masses straight.\"  Listen, if you're new to Nirvana... this is their breakthrough album.  You'll see that a ton of people tend to dog this album because they're enangered by the fact that most people don't like whatever kind of leather, or spiked hair enducing music that THEY listen to.  The fact is that this is the first aggressively hard pop record ever made with any ammount of success to it's name.  The fact that every one who has followed this albumn and has been blasted on the radio sucks, is not in fact the bands fault... it's the fault of record companies trying to milk the sound that originated from them by selling [...] music to consumers.  This album is beyond good... it's not \"depressing\" as people might have you believe.  The depression from that era came from every other band who came out AFTER NIRVANA---namely Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden who were all serious and mentally unstable.  Though Kurt was unstable, he had the good sense of making fun of it all with jokes and puns rather than crying about it.  So now that I've set you straight, I hope that you'll give this album the chance it deserves instead of listening to the one star raters who purposely give this album no credit to piss people off and to be considered cool because they are different than the majority.\n", "val": 0.023559240624308586}

{"text": "Some of these negative reviews are kind of ridiculous. First of all, it's absurd to judge the band Nirvana based on this one album. They released several other albums and recorded tons of other songs (many of which never made it to record.) The great thing about Nirvana was that b-sides like \"Even in His Youth\", \"Moist Vagina\", \"Laundry Room\", etc. were all outstanding. Bleach, In Utero, Incesticide, Outcesticide, Unplugged album...these are all great albums. It's hard to think of a band who is this consistent.Second, saying Kurt Cobain was not a brilliant songwriter is your opinion, and you're entitled to it. But millions of people think he was. His ability to write basic, yet brilliant and haunting, melodies is unmatched in my opinion. Not as prolific as Lennon, sure, but I believe he wrote better songs. Go listen to \"Do Re Mi\" on you tube. Its one of the last songs he ever wrote and the only recordings of it are terrible quality and scratchy, yet the brilliance shines through. His rendition of \"Where did you sleep last night\" on unplugged says it all as well. If that's not \"genius\" I don't know what is.As for this album, the guy who gave this album 3 stars for Rolling Stone was JUST ONE GUY. At the time the review came out, no one had heard of this band and he was probably the only one who listened to it at Rolling Stone. I hate to defend Rolling Stone because they suck in my opinion, but the fact that they raved about Nirvana later has nothing to do with how \"overhyped\" nirvana had become. In fact, Nirvana was the opposite of overhyped. They gained popularity through word of mouth and local djs playing their music, then mtv caught on, etc. etc...they had no marketing whatsoever from their label. The songs just struck a chord with people unlike any band I can remember in my lifetime. This is not their best album and it does not contain their best songs by any means, but it is still a great album--overrated only in comparison to Nirvana's other music.\n", "val": 0.016216175630688667}

Even as my friends were playing the albums, I just found the music to be an attempt to rock out, only to normally have weak songwriting and nothing memorable about the music to really help me understand why the genre became so popular.  All the bands sounded the same to me.However, Nevermind was really different from all the other ones.  It was angrier, and the lyrics were backed up with simple and interesting musical ideas.  Sure, all the songs on Nevermind sound almost identical to each other, with only minor changes in tempo and slight variations on the way the songs are written.  BUT, I happen to like this idea.I went five whole years without listening to this album, so the other day, in April of 2007, when I finally took it off the shelf and popped it into the CD player (well, DVD player) I was really surprised that the songwriting has really stood the test of time.  The songs that were enjoyable 15 years ago are still enjoyable today.Sure, you could argue that many of the songs have been played WAY too much through the years and are probably worn out, but to me, these songs are still fresh and exciting.  You will recognize every song.  It's not like you can forget them- they're all really catchy.  Very good songwriting overall.I still love the \"yeah yeah\" section of \"lithium\" and \"something in the way\" is such a scary way to close out an album.  Scary because it ends on such an unusual note.  \"smells like teen spirit\" remains a classic, as does the rest of the album.

{"text": "I want to say firstly that simply because an album is overrated does not neccessarily make it a bad album. I own plenty of overrated albums and I love them. They tend to be overrated for a reason. In this case I believe this album's impact is undeniable (for good or for bad) however it's content is almost ridiculously overrated, overhyped, and almost delusionally worshipped. I don't hate Nirvana or Kurt Kobain. I believe when they were recording this album they were just doing what they do. By the late 80's people were so freakin' sick of hair bands that the grunge movement was almost innevitable. But I still don't understand how the grunge movement could be seen as revolutionary. Rock n roll has alway been on a constant cycle. Rock n roll started out in the 1950's as simple three chord songs. In the 1960's rock became more sophisticated and actually became art. In the 1970's rock continued to progress but at times became overly ambitious and pretensious and that led to the retaliation of the punk movement in the late 70's and the new wave movement in the early 80's. By the late 1980's rock had been flooded by hair metal and then was killed by grunge. Yes Nevermind did put an end to the hair metal era. So what? The hair metal thing would have run it's course eventually and might have even morphed itself into something more interesting. Rock is continually on a roller coaster anyway. One minute it is okay to make ambitious complex rock and the next minute three chord songs are the only \"honest\" music. I have to say that these trends are generally opressive and have more to do with corporations than they do with the musicians. I personally believe rock can be sophisticated and accessible and honest all at the same time. By now we should have had another \"revolution\" one that makes it okay to do great ambitious rock. However, believe it or not the corporations who have a stranglehold on the music business are still reaping the benefits of Nevermind.\n", "val": 0.00028795807156711817}

Nevermind is a good album, but it's front loaded, and just doesn't have that something that makes it great. You can totally see all the ways their sound is replicated by other bands, but I don't find any of them to be terribly interesting either. Cobain's raspy vocals fit with his dark-natured guitar playing and lyrics, and he's a talented musician. But I think he's put on too high of a pedestal just because of how his career ended.\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is considered by many to be the best song of the decade, and one of the best ever. It's good, to be sure. It might just be hard for me to put it in context, having heard it for a long time without really knowing much about music when it was first popular (I had just turned four when the album was released). It's followed by four more good grunge songs I've heard before, and then six that I haven't. None of it's bad, it's just a little boring after the first half.

{"text": "<takes a deep breath> Reason for the nervousness is that Nirvana, like the Beatles, is one of those bands that you almost can't even criticize. It's like you're born fans whether you want to or not and saying otherwise will bring about a cavalcade of angry Nirvana fans telling you \"you don't know music, Nirvana was the greatest!\". And I will admit, at one point I was a massive fan (and let's face it, everyone in the early 90's was so you must as well act accordingly and be one too). To that note, this is probably the best Nirvana record; not because it's the most popular but on a song-by-song basis, it's the strongest.Smells Like Teen Spirit: If you hate that so-called grunge acts and alt rock groups of the 90's, blame it on this song. A dynamic opening track where everything just feels in its right place. Of course the thing's been overplayed beyond any song should have but still, quite the song. 10/10In Bloom: Despite the fact it's a well-known song from the album, I just never cared for it. I don't know why, the chorus is a big sing-along, the lyrics, as usual, are abstract and the guitar riff is there but for some reason I just never cared for it that much. 7/10Come as You Are: Literally the very first guitar riff I learned on guitar and thankfully it's attached to a good song. From it's memorable \"memoria\" pre-chorus to the drum beat giving the song a big dynamic, it's one of the better crafted songs on here. 8.5/10Breed: Good god I hate this song. Unlike In Bloom which I can tolerate if I heard it, for some reason I just skip this. The song is super energetic and fast-paced but I just never got into it. I do like the opening riff though. 7/10Lithium: One of the big hits and rightfully so. From it's low sounding guitar chords to probably the catchiest chorus on the record, it's easy to see why it became a hit. My one complaint? I never liked the \"I like you I'm not gonna cry\" section at all. Not 16 years ago and still not now...wow, 16 years. 8/10Polly: This song's so kitschy it's kinda funny. A weird sounding guitar, a song about a bird (although actually about a girl who escaped being tortured and imprisoned), the song to me just screams \"odd\". Of course it's a likeable ditty so all's forgiven. 8/10Territorial P*ssings: Not a big fan of this either. This is where the record kind of loses steam in a way. Big screaming vocals, a song with literally 2 riffs (the bridge riff is the most effective) but all that screaming gets grating. 7/10Drain You: Originally I didn't like this song. There wasn't enough to grab me but then the \"drai-ain you\" melody got stuck in my head then the song kind of got better. Some people will get hooked right away, others might take awhile. 7.5/10Lounge Act: One of the most underrated songs on this whole thing. From the vocal melody, the chords, then of course when Kurt screams part of the verse, it's one of those album songs album owners will probably gravitate to. 9/10Stay Away: I don't like this one either. There's not really much to grab onto. Some songs repeat certain things in order to make it stick in your mind easier but this just didn't do it. Some like it but I don't. 7/10On a Plain: It's funny, I like the version on Unplugged in New York better than this one but the basic core is a solid one. Melodies and guitar riffs are spot-on and while it may take awhile to properly sink in, it never becomes bothersome. 8/10Something in the Way: Another underrated song. Melancholy guitar and Kurt's voice almost sounding robotish in its tone, it's quite a somber song. If I can even remotely find a complaint is the chorus sometimes repeats too much. 8.5/10That's my non fanboy-ish/non Nirvana-hater review which is a good place to be in. You don't think everything they touch is good or think they were an overrated band with an abstract and vague lyricist having his \"lyrics\" called poetic, it's simply a fine record that for the most part, hits the nail on the head.\n", "val": 0.0333172008395195}

Cobain's guitars are loud and his chord progressions are tremendously catchy.  In fact, all the songs are very memorable.

Also, the guitars aren't painfully screeching and extremely distorted.Second, the lyrics are very well written.  Ultimately \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was actually Cobain's anger at the entertainment in general.  From the vocals of the album, Cobain really sounds like he hates apathy.  He sings about the mindlessness of youth--they spend so much time taking drugs, having sex, and engaging in gang wars.  Yet, none of them take the time to learn anything.  In a sense, the album name, \"Nevermind,\" says everything about teenage alienation at a fractured American world.Nirvana is incredible. They were one of the best bands in America.

For starters is the deserved smash Smells Like Teen Spirit - heavy yet melodic, hard-rocking yet vunerable, with one of the best guitar riffs of the '90's, yadda yadda yadda. All the praise you've heard about it is true. Even better is Lithium, disturbing yet unforgettable lyrics and a stick-in-your-mind, Dazed and Confused-esque descending bassline. And lotsa melody. Which is one reason I love Nirvana - Cobain's melodies were exquisite. Come As You Are is higlighted by a downright unforgettable ringing riff, In Bloom by a strong drum track and snarled refrain. Polly deals with rape in a disturbingly stark way, drawing you in while scaring you off. Breed and Drain You are some pretty raw, rockin' stuff, the kind of song the group did best. These were the hits, but how could anybody let the droning, mesmeric closer Something in the Way slip under the radar? Totally underrated song, I think.

As opposed to all these other morons, who whine about being \"misunderstood\" simply to make money.To close this rather wordy review, Nirvana (and Pearl Jam, and the rest of them) came just in time, justly knocking those stupid hair-metal bands off the charts and replacing them with a new golden age for rock rivaling the creatively fertile 1965-1975 period.

{"text": "If you want to call it groundbreaking, go ahead.  Nirvana came into the music industry an underdog and showed exactly what kind of flow you need to make it in the biz.  Minimal chords and catchy melodies make Nevermind a classic.  Nirvana did more with four chords than Motley Crue did with 100 leads and licks.  So why is Nevermind such a model for the industry?  Your about to find out why.\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" wasn't even supposed to be the hit. \"Come As You Are\" was supposed to be.  Nirvana and DGC figured they would release a more aggressive song first.  When \"Teen Spirit\" was released, there really wasn't much of a buzz right off the bat.  It just kinda seemed overnight.  I woke up one morning and \"Teen Spirit\" was everywhere.  When you really listen to the song you can feel Kurt Cobain's voice in the room.  Never has any artist come out and said \"here we are now, entertain us\".  That same voice can also be heard on pretty much every other song on the album.  \"Lounge Act\", \"Lithium\", and \"Drain You\" are testaments of Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohl.  The pounding of \"Drain You\" and the mellow-to-hard \"Lithium\" show the band's real side.The other singles, \"In Bloom\" and \"Come As You Are\", paint a nice picture of that Nirvana sound.  Meanwhile, \"Territorial Pissings\" and \"Breed\" are the reason why Nirvana sold records.  \"Stay Away\" and \"On A Plain\" keep the Nirvana flow going through the album.  \"Polly\" is the song that every Nirvana fan has grown to love.  When played live or in studio, \"Polly\" always sounds great.  The album ender, \"Something In The Way\", is sad, yet makes you want to just drift away into nirvana.  And for those of you who haven't heard the hidden track \"Endless Nameless\", you better.  You can heard Cobain smash his guitar at around 19:32.  Its quite remarkable what sounds Cobain can make.The reason I gave the album 4 stars is because it is not Nirvana's best work. Listen to In Utero and you'll see why it is their best work.

{"text": "I'm sorry, I know Im gonna get flamed for this but it is my opinion.Nirvana is by far one of the most dangerously overrated bands of all time. sorry its true. when i read in magazines readers poll top 50 guitar players of all time lists and kurt cobain is listed as number one? It is mind boggling!!! Jimmy page, Stevie ray vaghn, richie blackmoore, angus young, carlos santana? stevie vai, tonni iommi, dave murry, adrian smith, damn, even kirt hemit. i can go on for ages listing players that can play circles around kurt cobain. and one of the most brilliant songwriters of all time? its not that hard to write songs that are only 1-3 choreds people.People say that nirvana saved rock? I guess thats a matter of taste. I personally think they were the originators of the \"hey they made millions of dollars off that sound, lets do the same thing\" era of rock. and NO they did not start grunge. Pearl Jam was before them, and In my opinion eddie vedar was more talented than kurt.I'm not trying to just bash your band cause im a hater or anything. i'm not trying to say nirvana is the worst thing since New Coke. Im just sick of hearing everyone talkin about them like they are the greatest thing around. they are not. they had some nice catchy tones that were easy to listen to on the radio. enjoyable to listen to. yeah they made it big time and had a huge following. good for them. it is too bad kurt decided to end it all like he did, cause he could have had a hell of a career. and yes dave grohl is a damn good drummer.\n", "val": 0.001983446069061756}
{"text": "Listening to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" the starter to Nirvana's 'Nevermind' will always remind one why the album is such an alternative classic.  Definitive for the fast-forward thrust of their guitars and the primal scream trajectory of Kurt Cobain's blistering vocals, they literally invented alternative as we know it.  Nevertheless, even the most creative endeavors have their influences, and ingredients are mixed and matched for the newest alchemy.  While one can cite John Lennon's 'Plastic Ono Band' as a vocal first and The Replacements as  influences, their blend here is new and masterful.  While \"grunge\" may be more of a fashion statement than a sound bite for the C.D., \"garage band\" is a more apt description of what they perfected for all.  With a mix of punk and heavy metal, they jump start a whole new genre.Besides the absolutely sublime primal angst of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" there's the propulsive \"Breed,\" and the iconoclastic \"Territorial Pissings\".  With a mocking intro that starts falsely with \"Get Together,\" the latter song does more than separate the generations musically and lyrically.  Then, there's the expert texture of more mid-tempo gems like \"Lithium,\" the beautifully acoustical \"Polly,\" and the throbbing and multi-layered \"Drain You\".  \"Lounge Act\" keeps the energy going and drummer, David Grohl, whose gruelling efforts are remarkable all the way, really delivers on \"Stay Away\".  The vocal tradeoff between Cobain and bassist, Chris Novoselic proves that you can do alternative and have great voices--that is tuneful and with great trajectory.  If the variations of expert guitar patterns don't disappoint, then the variety certainly scotches any complaints of formula.  \"Something in the Way,\" which closes the album, forecasts a more \"unplugged\" future, even though the expertise of guitar work hardly needs elaboration.After 'Nevermind' has played endlessly on the radio, it is easy to take their work for granted.  I, for one, didn't even realize that all these songs were Nirvana's.  Which goes to prove that their innovations would make music new again, and it would take some people a while to catch up--not just musicians, but even some listeners.\n", "val": 0.02344629168510437}

Yes, it saved us from hair metal and brought us back someplace further down to earth (whether it was a good place or bad place all depends on one's taste).But historical importance aside, this is basically Nirvana with bells and whistles. Studio gloss may have served them well as far as making them household names of epic proportions and, again, presenting something new to popular music, but as far as giving them any real artistic credibility or showcasing their raw (emphasis on RAW) punk roots, it accomplishes very little, in my opinion.

That's perfectly fine with me. But in September of 1991 when this album was released, something called \"grunge\" was about to emerge, and \"grunge\" definitely sounded like rock's kid brother.At first glance, and listen, this album is hard to understand, and hard to get into... That is all part of its pure genius. If you buy this album, listen to songs like \"Polly\" or \"Lithium\" while looking at the lyrics online...you'll be able to scratch the surface of perhaps the most damaged soul to ever step on stage.This album follows the masterpiece of an album \"Bleach\" which was not very commercially successful, but is a staple addition to any Nirvana fan's collection. \"Nevermind\" literally is Kurt Cobain. In every sense of the word. It is his magnum opus, his Mona Lisa. Kurt painted a picture of a person with so much pain and suffering, without actually picking up a paintbrush. This album is the early 90's, and this album is Kurt Cobain. If you are interested in one of the most influential records to come out of the past 20 years, Nevermind is what you are looking for.Nevermind is exactly what the everyday CD purchasing-aholic is looking for. A CD with influence, pizzazz, a famous icon at the forefront, countless behind the scenes stories and innuendoes, a single that changed the course of popular music as we know it, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", and several other stellar songs surrounding it on the playlist. What makes Nevermind such a good buy is simple really, every song is a classic, and every song stands out for some reason or another as good. Highlight's include the previously stated \"Polly\" and \"Lithium\", along with \"Come As You Are\" and the less popular but equally amazing, \"Territorial Pissings\".To finish up, if you enjoy rock and roll music, want to hear some of the best music to come out of the last 20 years, are interested in finding out why RollingStone Magazine chose Nevermind as the 17th greatest album of all time, out of 500, you should purchase this album.\n", "val": 0.02864420786499977}

{"text": "Why Kurt Cobain is a Hero1. He killed 80s rock and Michael Jackson.2. At the 1992 VMAs, he challenged MTV, refusing to play \"Teen Spirit,\" prefering \"Rape Me\" and \"New Poopie\" as better songs to perform for the MTV audiences (then likely 12-25 year olds, now 8-11 year olds). They settled on \"Lithium\" (a great song in its own right, lyrical and vocal art). He played the opening to \"Rape Me\" to spook MTV Executives, and quickly changed while MTV briefly went off air.3. He made a hit single named after girl's deoderant4. The Rolling Stone names him one of the greatest guitarists ever, even though he only uses power chords. I can play Nirvana songs5. Pearl Jam's \"Ten\" was released a month before \"Nevermind,\" but didn't start selling oodles of units until a month after \"Nevermind\"'s release, during the \"Teen Spirit\" craze.6. He played almost all B-Side songs in his Unplugged set, which is haled as the best Unplugged ever done, and one of the best live performances in the 90s, and in 20th Century music7. He  burned out as a Martyr instead of fading out like a tool8. \"Teen Spirit\" was spun some 60 times a week on the average American radio station9. \"Nevermind\" started the alternative movement, dragging lesser known bands like Dinosaur Jr, Mudhoney, the Meat Puppets and the Melvins closer to the mainstream.10. Nevermind was named by WBCN in Boston as the 6th best rock album of all time. It does not have one bad note on it. It truly is the best album of the 90s, and the 80s for that matter.

{"text": "At first I was going to rate this recording with 4 stars, but decided otherwise while reflecting on the creativity, originality, and overall influence this recording has had in the pop/rock music world over the past decade. I suppose one can debate the degree of creativity and originality. Nirvana themselves were always quick to give credit to their influences which included The Ramones, Meat Puppets, Husker Du, and The Vasolines. But in my opinion I don't think one can underestimate Kurt's talent both as a musician and songwriter. It probably seems more obvious when listening to the follow-up recording In Utero, since Nevermind does suffer somewhat from a \"mersh\" sound production quality. In any case, the playing of drummer Dave Grohl and bassist Chris Novoselic on this recording prove that Nirvana had paid their dues in spending years honing their musical crafts. Like other notable trios, Nirvana understood that percussion and bass should stand out more in a trio setting. And Grohl and Novoselic seem to relish their roles.May be the proof of the originality and creativity of this band lies in the fact that one would be hard pressed to finger obvious historical precedents to such original songs as Come as You are, Breed, In Bloom, Lithium, and Polly. Sure, the blueprints had been laid by the above mentioned influences, but the value added by Nirvana cannot be underestimated; especially by the way of Kurt's poetic lyrics.This recording represents a very good starting point for appeciating Nirvana. But of course it should be followed by In Utero which has significantly more passion, energy, and better sound production. I suppose if this recording gets five stars, then In Utero gets 6 or 7. It is admittedly my first choice of listen should I be in the mood for Nirvana.In closing I would just like to add that music is a form of art, and it makes no sense to create a linear ordering (where every pair of artists must be compared as better or worse) on the set of musicians. Why is it so difficult to appreciate all of following artists without slamming one versus the other: Mozart, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, Metallica, Nirvana? Why is it that in a supposedly free society some people seem so in a hurry to close their minds to music and other art forms? Ah...Nevermind.\n", "val": 0.0003801595885306597}

This album is great and so is Nirvana--not just Kurt Cobain. The band is not great because any of its members are a god, but because they wrote amazing songs. None of the members were virtuosos; the songs are, in fact, quite simple, but in their simplicity lies the bands talent. The riffs are grungey, but very catchy--almost as catchy as the lyrics.

{"text": "Not just for those interested in \"grunge\" or \"punk\" but also for Beatle lovers everywhere, if you love rock and roll you must own this album, as it is Cobain's masterwork where all of his influences came together.The songwriting here is brilliant, especially in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", \"In Bloom\", \"Breed\", \"Lithium\", \"Drain You, \"Lounge Act\", and \"On A Plain\" (Too many highlights, oh well).  And those are just my favorites anyway,  not to mention the battering ram introduced by a Youngbloods' lyric \"Territorial Pissings\", or the dark acoustic \"Polly\".  Forget about all that revolution talk and listen to the music, then ask yourself what you would think if you had heard this album and no one had heard it before (I think you know the answer, something like \"WOW, these guys are gonna be HUGE!\").So what if there are pop hooks galore in the music, for Cobain the Beatlemaniac it definitely makes sense.  And so what if the guitar solos aren't intricate enough, if you want guitar solos listen to Bleach because this is where the songwriting, melodies, and riffs scrape up at perfection.While some say In Utero is the better album, could you really listen to that album more than once in a day?  Maybe, but I've listened to this album five times in a row before.  And then those who say Unplugged is their finest moment, sure \"About A Girl\" and \"The Man Who Sold The World\" are some of Nirvana's finest performances, but other than \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\" and \"Lake of Fire\" none of the intensity of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is there, let alone the fun of \"Breed\" and \"Lithium\".This is the album where it was still fun and Cobain had just realized his genius.  This was before all the drugs, the fame, and most of all before Courtney Love.  Some may say this album would've never been so popular without Cobain dying, and that is completely wrong.  For that to be true it's better to look at Unplugged or In Utero which are easy to pity in retrospect, unlike the confidence and genius of Nevermind that Cobain SHOULD be remembered by (but far too frequently is not, unfortunately).  This album is hands down the best cd of the nineties, and stands up there with the classics from the Beatles, Zeppelin, The Who, Creedence, Clash, Sex Pistols, X, and etcetera.  Forget about the hype and the pain of the later days and just listen to the music, you'll find it sticks up well on its own, straight up and brilliant.\n", "val": 0.01297051552683115}

It doesn't have the rawness (with exception to say breed and territorial pissings) that Nirvana were all about in Bleach, In Utero, Incesticide and their live material. Its a great album, with great tracks that has influenced so many people and so many bands. However In Utero is a much vaster recording spanning different moods and styles of music, and to me has a lot more passion in it compared to this slightly weakened pop version of Nirvana. I also think In Utero tells so much more about what the band were going through at that phase with pain, love and disillusionment. If you want the definitive Nirvana album go for In Utero, its like a mature and refined bleach. However you should be buying all nirvana albums as they are the best band of the lates 80s and early 90s, the only band really to get even close to their impact in the 90s was Radiohead.

Nevermind is an instant classic and will be listened to by every generation of true rock fans.  Every song is brilliant in it's energy and impeccable sense of rebellion.

Sure, there is nothing wrong with basic musicianship, not every band has to be a complex mish mash, but to call these guys one of the greatest bands on Earth, come one, they weren't that good.Kurt was obviously the mastermind behind this band, and he mastered three chord progressions, big deal. There are millions of people who have done that, but they are still playing in their garages and have virtually no fan base at all.

Maybe all musicians and songwriters should just give up, cause we already have metullica (just shoot me now!). As for guitar solos some songs believe it or not don't need a two minute guitar break.

But the music?????O-H M-Y G-O-O-D-N-E-S-S!!!!!!!Who.....made this stuff,since I could hardly call written. Sometimes I wonder what goes through rock critics (of all ages) minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker 'classic' on it. Okay first off Kurt Cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where I come from-I feel sorry for him. And his band (sorry) are so ametaurish it isn't even fresh or funny. Bands like U2 or The Clash were inexperienced at first but still made great,lively and powerful music from the beginning. But all this ends up is as an aural heroin 'daze'-the guitars are cloudy,Cobain's already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here \"Something In The Way\" still has no vital spark. To me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as Cobain wasted his talented (which may in fact exist) on forcing us to endure his inaudible,drug crazed 'wailing' of rants like \"Terrestrail Pissings\".And the acoustic \"Polly\"?Sounds like the worst garage band in the world. So why is 'Nevermind' called a masterpiece?Simple-Nirvana,despite fancying themselves anti establishment were (and still are)the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted PR campaign since the days of The Beatles. But there (again despite critics) is where the comparasin between Nirvana and The Beatles ends-for one \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is NOT a modern day \"More Then A Feeling\" and nothing Grohl,Cobain or the others do is anywhere close to Beatle-esque. Not only that (even if it's not Cobains fault) his music set a new record for rock n' roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and ALL of these records sound like 'Nevermind'.Also Cobains cynical and sad outlook,although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply.....stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past. So this began the 'grunge generation' in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record?Technically very much?Should it be stripped from the market?NEVER,and that's the only reason why this should exist. Every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt-it's in the constitution. But also everyone has the right to their opinion so I felt compelled to get one. So if you subscribe to the grunge culture and don't have this you probably should,you'll love it. But if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble,lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear. But I had to hear it to have an opinion. My main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-I know others feel as I do. If Nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesn't always have to be a picture perfect one.\n", "val": 0.000109989290649537}

Until then, so-called \"hair metal\" bands ruled the charts and even the late Kurt Cobain himself stated that people wanted something different than Warrant (although I never stopped loving bands such as Warrant, Winger, Poison, etc.  At least they could write songs dealing with topics other than being angry 24/7 and they could sing some great ballads).Nevertheless, I was excited to see the change this album brought to popular music (it was time for change) and the results (for me) were 50/50: It inspired some good ones and a whole lot of bad ones (but blame music company execs for that!).As for all this talk about The Beatles vs. Nirvana: People are simply comparing apples to oranges and it's outright dumb (ignorant, really) to compare two very different groups from two very different time periods (although it's worth mentioning that the first song Cobain played on the guitar was a Beatles tune and they were one of his main musical inspirations).  As much of an impact as Nirvana had in the early-90's, it was nowhere near the scale of The Beatles.  Period.For me, \"Nevermind\" is a classic and, 15 years after its release, you can still feel the change it generated within the music industry. Listening to this never fails to put a smile on my face. - Donna Di Giacomo\n", "val": 0.01498930249363184}
{"text": "Nevermind is more or less a pop album and should be judged as such, but obviosly there is a ferocious punk aggression that also fuels Nirvana's music. Basically this is album of great, hooky songs from start to finish but theres an abstract intelligence to the lyrics which adds weight to it as well. As  some of the sad Nirvana bashers have pointed out Kurt wasn't a technical musician who played a lot of notes but he was an inspired songwriter who could do great things with just a few chords. In my opinion he stands beside pop geniuses like The Beatles and Brian Wilson as one of the greats of twentieth century music. Smells Like Teen Spirit is a classic single despite being played to death which distilled the mood of the times. In Bloom is more classic pop along with Come As You Are. Breed amps the pace up with a riff of near metal intensity. Lithium is another great song with an intense, hooky chorus. Polly is an enjoyable low key track about a dark subject (rape). Territorial Pissings is a welcome blast of Sex Pistols like punk ferosity. Drain You is an inventive song, being seemingly abstract but based on only 4 power chords more or less. Lounge Act is a great tune with an intense finish and strangely sounds reminiscent of the Police. On A Plain for me is a favourite track with great hooks and to me is an underrated classic with a great hook \"Love myself, better than you/ I know its wrong but what should I do?\" Its very easy to look back on this album with the burden of pop history and somewhat recoil against all the acclaim because so many people love Nirvana. I recently returned to this album after not listening to it for 8 years and was impressed by its consistency and well crafted songs. I am a fan of music from all eras from 60s greats like The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and others through to grunge (Soundgarden, Alice In Chains), metal (Pantera, Slayer, Meshuggah, Down etc, hard rock (Clutch, Corrosion of Conformity, Kyuss)and I'd just like to point how laughable and sad it is that people without much real knowledge about music and that lack open minds are bashing things they don't understand like the running debate between people who liked classic rock versus people who like Nirvana whose arguments consist of Nirvana is rubbish The Beatles were better. Or Nirvana rules the Beatles sucked. Hardly reasoned arguments. You can't really compare the two because they came from different eras and mindsets but both were great bands. The Beatles were more sophisticated, varied and musical than Nirvana but Nirvana had a rawness and aggression and focus than sometimes the Beatles lacked. But both were great bands if someone looks at it with an open mind. Anyway Nevermind is a great album, full of great pop songs. If you like that sort of music you'll probably enjoy it.\n", "val": 0.017102574929594994}

This one of those albums where you can't really analyze the lyrics, because that will only confuse you. However, the musical talent of Kurt and co. is superb. It can make up for the lyrics easily. Dave's drumming is beyond words. Novoselic's bass lines are great. And Kurt gives us some memorable riffs as well, with a great \"grunge voice\", I guess you could put it.And please, let's not shout that we hope Kurt burns in Hell. One, it's not very nice, and two, it's very childish. And to stab back at the comments on how he was just a druggie, that's like saying a bird has feathers, or the sky is blue. Think about it. Almost EVERY great rock band has had at least one member that did drugs. I'm sure if you cared to look, you'd find drug problems to be common amoung classic rock and roll bands.

{"text": "Most of those who gave Nevermind one star have justified their evaluation by saying that Nirvana \"sucks\". This is hard to argue with, because it doesn't really say anything at all about the band, though it does say something about the reviewer's taste in music and possibly their age.The detractors who provided any form of cogent argument as to why this album is bad say that Nirvana is primarily a Grunge/Punk band, and that Grunge/Punk bands are nothing more than expressions of \"teenage angst\".Again, this says more about the negative reviewers' taste in music than anything about Nirvana.It's rather unfair to lump Nirvana into a broad category which you already dislike, and then by virtue of its place in that category, to proclaim that you dislike Nirvana.If you actually listen to Nevermind you'll find just as many Metal, Rock and even Pop influences as Grunge or Punk. The most obvious example of a Pop influence is Cobain's outright statement that \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was an imitation of a Pixies song.Rather than attempting to categorise Nirvana into a genre that you already hate on principle, actually listen to Nevermind.

I didn't hear it until 1992, but I was just blown away by the riffs and well recorded songs.  There's a rawness to this album that doesn't let go!  Smells Like Teen Spirit is still fresh 15 years later, as well as Lithium, Polly, the more poppish Come as You Are, On A Plane and others. One of two surprises that also stand out is Territorial, which zooms so fast at 115 mph in its sound and how they slow the speed down dramatically as if a record player is turned off. Kurt Cobain's screaming like crazy after the first minute. It sounds as if you're hearing the guitars mashed right up very close to the amplifiers, all the screeches and the like!  It makes for a great song without the typical formulaic verse/chorus/verse songs we're used to hearing.  Another surprise is the quiet ballad, Something in the Way and its acoustic feel. Melodic and well written. I never thought that Nirvana would pull it off on that song--I thought they were mostly loud all the time, but this is one of their best songs from their catalog. The album's Kurt Cobain all throughout, but Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic were superb on the lead guitars and drums that dominate this effort. It has really had an impact on Dave's current success with the Foo Fighters.  The songwriting from Cobain was different, but top notch. After Nevermind, nearly every alternative band except Pearl Jam was copying its sounds and textures.  Some succeeded and some failed. This album helped make alternative music dominate 6 years of the '90s, yet it balanced well with the R&B ballads, rap, dance and pop artists that dominated the decade. Although Cobain is no longer with us, this album keeps his and his band's spirit completely alive. Ten to 20 years from now, they're still going to be talking about this album. Kurt didn't expect the multi-platinum success it got, but people still love it, still buy it and are still playing it. It is one of the 20th century's best albums, artistic, aggressive and chance taking.\n", "val": 0.11282609403133392}
{"text": "For some reason, it seems like for the last while it has become more and more trendy and hip to discredit this album. I, for one, will not sit by idly and let it happen without voicing my opinion.To begin with, the most overused and only somewhat valid complaint about Nirvana, and this album in particular, is that they weren't the originators. They completely ripped off the Pixies. Ok sure. Kurt admitted he stole a few chords from the Pixies. Big deal. Does anyone have any clue as to how many songs use the same chords? Especially in rock, where power chords are commonly used. People must realize that chord progressions aren't what makes a rock group unique, or groundbreaking. The Pixies may have been one Kurt's many, many influences, but not nearly to the extent that Nirvana was just ripping them off. This argument has become a popular \"look at me I'm cool and smart because I know music history better than you\" mantra of the Nevermind antagonists, but is a tired and pointless way to dismiss Nevermind.Secondly, those who don't think this album is special either A) weren't alive in 1991-92, or B) have completely lost their memory. Dare I say no other album in history has changed the music industry the way Nevermind did. It captured the general feelings of apathy and cynicism that permeated society at the time. During a time where radio was dominated by polished, fake, and contrived \"artists,\" Nevermind was the thing we automatically attached to because THAT was the way we felt. Nobody could relate to Poison or Michael Jackson.Third, a lot of people think of Kurt as a selfish, heartless maniac. This perception is entirely baseless and naive. He absolutely hated his popularity. He wasn't after fame, or riches, or any of the things that many existing bands were/are after. The people he admired were people like Daniel Johnston and Calvin Johnson, truly sincere and unassuming people. And the judgmental people who write off his suicide as cowardly and selfish obviously have little experience or knowledge about mental conditions that are very real and can rarely be blamed on the person. How dare you think you'd respond any better than he if you were in his shoes...you never knew him well enough to know such things anyway. You people must be invincible. Congratulations for achieving perfection.This album has a place in me that no other music holds.Too bad many of you have forgotten, or never experienced, the true emotions behind this truly landmark album.Oh well, whatever, Nevermind.\n", "val": 9.704133117338642e-05}

{"text": "It's quite unbelievable how overrated Nirvana are, there is no other band in history that are regard so highly with so little work to show for it. Rolling Stone and other music magazine continue to eat up the rubbish Cobain and co. created, simply because they needed something new after the 80's to sell their publications. I admit that I own a lot of Nirvana's work, but I accept it for what it really is, watered down heavy metal with no lyrical or musical depth.Where do your start with Nirvana's short coming. First of all they were presented as some kind of saviours of rock, who had come to save us from hair metal. A band that would bring content, along with heavy riffs. The truth is, Nirvana are a one hit wonder, they never really reached the standards smell like teen spirit set. People will always argue about the many classic on 'In Utero' or 'Unplugged in New York', but they really were just one hit wonders. Further more that one hit was a based on a riff stolen from Boston's 'More than a felling'. The fact is Nirvana and Kurt Cobain specially, are nothing but rip-off artists, the only difference between them and Oasis is that Oasis admitted they ripped off other bands. Nirvana stole riffs and ideas from everybody, Boston, Killing Joke, Mudhoney, Sonic Youth, and Meat Puppets. You name it, they stole it.That brings me to the so called musical greatness that is Kurt Cobain, the biggest hack in history. I've seen Rolling Stone put him in there greatest song writers of all time and guitarists. Please the guy's songs were dull and repetitive and drug nightmares, even then he could not pull that off with the half ass class of Alice in Chains. His guitar work was awful. All his decent riffs were ripped off from other bands. His also an unbelievable hypocrite. He states that Pearl Jam are sell outs, but Nirvana were signed to Geffen and practically brought grunge to suburbia. He also appears on the cover of Bliss magazine and continues doe interviews for MTV, playing their poster boy for grunge. Who's the real sell out? He was so upset with becoming successful, why didn't he stop making videos and stop releasing singles like Pearl Jam. The truth is Kurt Cobain had no real talent, he stole a riff off Bosten and made a fortune, and when it was time for a follow, he could not cut it, so took the easy route and took his life, so people will forever go one about what he could have achieved. They guy is a hack and if he was still alive now, he still be a one hit wonder.\n", "val": 9.86908416962251e-05}
{"text": "Most people reading this already owns this CD anyways, but I'm going to say my bit anyways.  This album is notorious for what it did to the music industry within months of its release: it not only helped kill off the stagnant and already-dying 80's metal scene, but it pushed everything prepackaged and inherently processed aside (it started Michael Jackson's sales decline), and for that I absolutely love this album.  Plus, if not for Nirvana, I probably wouldn't have discovered Soundgarden or Alice In Chains until much later, and considering my personal life in 1992, I dread to think of what other musical choices I had to listen to back then.As far as the songs on this CD, if it only had \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" recorded twelve times, it would still be a great album.  Luckily, there are a few more, and they're all quite good.  As far as Nirvana's best album, that title would go to _In Utero_, but by then they were already established and people bought _In Utero_ out of habit.  _Bleach_ is another one that everyone should own, since the songs are much more raw and loose than on _Nevermind_, but the drumming kinda sucks, since Dave Grohl wasn't part of the band yet.I stopped listening to Nirvana abruptly after Cobain chose to leave the industry, but after a few years of listening to all the newer bands imitate the style, it was very refreshing to go back and listen to _Nevermind_ as if it were my first time.  And for killing off hair metal, I will forever love this album...\n", "val": 0.0337066575884819}
{"text": "It has been 12 years after the death of Kurt Cobain. So attention, Nirvana elitists. Did you get that the first time? Let me repeat myself. Kurt Cobain has been dead for 12 years. Okay. Now that you understand that...GET OVER IT. He is dead!!! Okay, he shot himself in the head and killed himself with a shotgun. He isn't on an island somewhere, or living in a basement in Los Angeles somewhere. He is dead. So, when you Nirvana elitists grow up and realize that this drug-infested hack was not a genius, and that he is in the dirt being eaten by a bunch of worms, then I will forgive you for all your sins since the death of Kurt in 1994. Look. He was the most overrated guitarist in history. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine said that he was #12 on the list of greatest guitarists of all-time. When I saw that, I wanted to get a shotgun and blow my head off. How could you think that this guy was a genius?Compared to the other big 3 in grunge, (Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam), Kurt Cobain cannot even hold a candle to those guitarists. Chris Cornell (played guitar), Jerry Cantrell and Eddie Vedder are better singers, songwriters and guitar players than this hack. His lyrics were nothing but revolving around his depression, drug problem and overall angst that made Nirvana an MTV favorite. Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell of Alice In Chains both had better lyrics and vocals, and Chris Cornell could sing ten times better than Cobain. Kurt is more of the worst guitar player in history than the best. As other reviewers stated, he lowered the standards for how to be popular. He spawned MTV to its peak of popularity, and it seems the last year MTV played something good was 1994. Thanks, Kurt! You really did us a good job. And, unlike other reviewers, I am not happy he's dead, but I can really care less because he took his own life and didn't take it like a real man.So on to the other two members. The bassist is descent if that, and another overrated one. Drummer Dave Grohl is the only talented one here, because not only did he own on drums, but he did the entire first Foo Fighter's CD all by himself, showing that he does have talent. And the music? As a fan of metal (no...and not the MTV metal-core garbage), I listened to this with an open mind. And what I got was pure frustration, because this tripe is the most overrated thing I have ever heard in my life. Can someone please tell me why this is a classic? A classic is something like \"Led Zeppelin IV\", Slayer's \"Reign In Blood\" or any Pink Floyd CD. Only one or two good songs do not warrant the word classic. Alice In Chains, Soundgarden and even Pearl Jam wipe the floor with this nonsense. An overall disappointment. Grunge didn't die in 1994. It died in 2002 (when Layne Staley of Alice In Chains died).So, Nirvana not only lowered the standards of musicians today, but they also kicked off this revolution of garbage mainstream music. This may be a coincidence, but I feel Nirvana helped set the stage for all the angsty stuff on MTV and mainstream radio. Also, Kurt Cobain is a hypocrite. He says he hated the mainstream, yet he continuously made music videos for MTV. Also, a little known fact. After Cobain blew his brains out, Nirvana album sales went through the roof. Videos were re-aired, radio was playing them again and album sales were jumping. Nobody gives this much credit to Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, who was murdered tragically, but they give this hack Cobain who couldn't produce good music acclaim. I don't mean to pick on Nirvana, but Kurt and his \"influence\" and \"genius\" just pisses me off. A lot of potential in this album, but give these guys a better guitarist, and it may sound better!RECOMMENDED 90'S GRUNGE/ROCK ALBUMS:Alice In Chains - \"Dirt\"/\"Jar Of Flies\"Soundgarden - \"Superunknown\"/\"Badmotorfinger\"Pearl Jam - \"Ten\"/\"Vs\"Rage Against the Machine - \"Rage Against the Machine\"/\"Evil Empire\"\n", "val": 0.00011025089042959735}
{"text": "Nirvana's Nevermind easily ranks as one of the most overrated albums ever made. In any kind of music, period.Now before you Nirvana fanboys/girls rip me apart, just let me confirm that I don't hate your favorite band (although I do think they are criminally overrated) and I'm not one of those who celebrated Kurt's death. But I do have some major complaints about this album.Now about Kurt. A genius?! Don't make me bang my head on the keyboard out of laughing. And seriously all you guys who still mourn his death saying \"KuRt'Z DeTh WaZ LyeK a StAb In MaH HarTT\" are really starting to get on my nerves. Kurt was nothing special, face it. Why can't you mourn Cliff Burton, Dimebag Darrell, Layne Staley or Chuck Schuldiner? These guys had far more talent than Kurt, and got practically none of the attention they deserved, and today are being forgotten. If Kurt Cobain was a genius the James Hetfield is the Albert Einstein of guitar/vocals, give me a f**king brake. Kurt was easily the most overrated guitarist ever, he never played a half-decent solo and all the songs are structured from 3 powerchords at best. And his vocals were not much better, they were decent at their best and at their worst they were just unbearable. In most of the songs he sings properly in the verse and in the chorus he screams and sounds like a drug abuser. Now I have nothing against screaming in music, but the singer needs to have some abilty to do this. Bruce Dickinson can do it properly, and so Rob Halford, Phil Anselmo and Tom Araya. But Kurt couldn't. However Kurt had some upsides though, his songwriting was quite good, and at least he didn't write lyrics like Korn, Slipknot and Linkin Park who write lyrics all about how depressed they are. The 2 other dudes were also above average. Kris was a decent bassist. Dave Grohl is a great drummer (although he does better stuff today). The album's opener, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', although extremely overplayed, is probably the best song on the album, although the chorus sucks (due to Kurt's screaming) the verse is great and the basslines and drum beats are actually good. 'Come As You Are' is decent, 'Lithium' is pretty bland. Other than that, this album is boring, uninspired and heavily overrated. And it didn't save rock and roll at any point. The didn't even started grunge (that would be Soundgarden), but I still have doubts that if Pearl Jam's 'Ten' wasn't, but Nevermind was then hair metal was killed.Nirvana had actually made some really good songs on their swansong In Ultero and few decent on Bleach. These albums have much more well-structured songs, slightly better vocals, although the guitars are still bad. But still Nirvana has nothing on other bands from Seattle such as Queensryche (although they're not grunge), Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots or even Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. All in all, this is not an album that has aged well (despite what many may think) and is easily Nirvana's worst. Judge for yourself.\n", "val": 0.005012921988964081}
{"text": "From the opening chords and primal screams of Smells Like Teen Spirit to the closing strings and melancholy of Something In The Way, Seattle band Nirvana's 1991 modern classic Nevermind stands as the most important rock album of the past 2 decades. Upon its release, the album instantly boomed, making Nirvana the biggest band in the world, popularizing alternative rock, or what was later known as grunge rock (a Seattle sound combining heavy metal, punk and indie rock), paving way for many bands to rise up to the big time (e.g. Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Bush, Alice In Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, and Stone Temple Pilots), and labeling the band's frontman Kurt Cobain 'the voice of a generation'. The album became so huge in such a short time that, within a month or two, it kicked Michael Jackson's then Number 1 album Dangerous off the top of the Billboard Album chart.Nevermind is a mindblowing 12-track album featuring the band at their peak, and Kurt Cobain, Nirvana's late lead singer, songwriter and guitarist, at his most vulnerable and, ironically, best.Smells Like Teen Spirit, considered to be Nirvana's most popular song, is an ambitious rock 'n roll anthem marked for its memorable intro and rebelliously loud screaming guitars and vocals, Dave Grohl's vicious drumming, and some of the wierdest but sharp-as-nails lyrics. Other tracks worth mentioning for unique quality are Come As You Are, a gloomy bass-driven track with Cobain falsely admitting that he \"don't have a gun,\" (note: Kurt shot himself to death in 1994), the mesmerizingly confusing Lithium which features some of the best guitar work on the entire album, the little ditty Polly, the bluesy On A Plain, the satirical, and one of my personal favorites, In Bloom, the cutting edge punk numbers Drain You and Stay Away, and the wonderfully written Something In The Way.RecommendedA\n", "val": 0.06082778424024582}

Yeah, bands like Mudhoney and other grunge bands  were the \"in\" thing.  But this music was hard,subliminal, emotional, substantial, catchy and exciting. I just instantly knew that this record was a classic and something new.  I like to think of this record as a beginning and an end.  It summed up a lot of what had been going on in music from the Replacements and Husker Du to Dinosaur Jr. to the Minutemen.  And yet an element of the Beatles was added.  And Neil Young.

{"text": "This album is the most overrated object probably ever. It isn't the worst, just given credit where it isn't do. David Grohl was a good drummer but he is nowhere close to the level of Neil Peart. Krist is mediocre at bass. But the essence of which this album becomes overrated is Kurt Cobain. The mass following of this person has given him an illusion of perfection. He was terrible at playing guitar, and even worse at singing. But mostly he is given credit for sonwriting. Breifly examining the songs we notice \"Polly\" and \"Lithium\" are basically the same riff. \"Come As YOU Are\", one of the most noteworthy songs on this record, is known for a riff that a band called Killing Joke already used. The so-called amazing songwriting that \"defined\" Cobain, starts with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", probably the worst track on the album. Four power chords and two notes any fledgling gutiarist could muster. The solo is slow and encompasses about 8 notes. \"In Bloom\" follows basically the same with a solo based slowly off the vocals, as does \"Come As You Are\". \"Breed\" is much better than the first three and the next two. After \"Lithium\" and \"Polly\" we enter a son called \"terretorial Pissings\" which is just a rip-off of \"Breed\". We then reach the best song on the album \"Drain You\", which is the only song on the album that dpesn't make use of stupid lyrics. The rest of the album is okay, but essientally they are just repeats of others.The lyrics on the album usually are nonsense, though there are a few exceptions, mostly \"TP\".The final overrated part of the album is it's \"Impact\".Everyone assumes one day everyone was lsitening to Madonna, and SLTS came on the radio and everyone was wearing flannel the next day. We know it was 1992 when they hit it big. Four years earlier in 1988 R.E.M. hit it big with \"it's the end of the world as we know it\" and Jane's Addiction was nominated for a Grammy. In 1990GN'R was wearing flannel, and Alice In Chains was releasing there best known song \"Man In The Box\". Red Hot Chili Peppers were already popular and then finally SLTS became a hit. Two months later Pearl Jam became more popular then Nirvana. But they quit releasing MTV videos. Two years later Kurt Cobain is dead and MTV milks it for what it's worth. So in the end we see a mediocre album that is repetitive and used as sympathy for a dead man. Not much at all.Is buying this record worth.

{"text": "I don't know where to start, but first of all, I would like to say that this album is not a bad album, it's an amazing rock record. Is Nevermind overrated? Perhaps it is, but it doesn't make this album sounds bad. I don't claim Nevermind to be the best rock record on earth, but it's just one of those many good classics albums in music history and it's a must own. Almost every song in here is good enough to be a hit single.Nirvana is not the best rock band ever, Kurt is neither a great vocalist and guitarist and every members of the band are not the master of their instrument, but their music is revolutionary. Kurt is a great songwriter and he did popularize grunge music to the world. Although there aren't any complicated guitar solo in their songs, but Nirvana's song is so different and they got their own music style. Kurt created good music and catchy guitar riff using simpler and easier chord progression to blow the listeners away and this proof that Kurt really got the talent and potential in creating good music.Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic done their job very well too. No need to say, Dave Grohl is a great drummer. His drumming was just like crazy. Krist Novoselic's bass is another to be praised. The bass doesn't just follow up to the guitar but it really plays something. His bass playing shines and stands out in almost every single song. Without Krist Novoselic's bass, Nirvana's songs wouldn't be that good.The record starts with the hit single, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', the grunge anthem. This is a very powerful song and the guitar riff is very catchy. Kurt's singing is very good here. I like the part when he screams the song \"a denial...\" in the end of the song. The bass and drum played in this song are awesome too. This is perhaps the most famous and influencing song of Nirvana. The second song, 'In Bloom' is another fans favorite, but I just don't like this song very much. I think it's just so-so. 'Come As You Are' and 'Lithium' are much more better. 'Come As You Are' has nice guitar intro in the opening and 'Lithium' got a great chorus. 'Polly' is another great song on this album and it's an acoustic song with interesting lyric. Another acoustic song here is the last song, 'Something In The Way'. Not as good as 'Polly' but is also a good song. 'Drain You' is another personal favorite of mine. 'Territorial Pissings' is somewhat rough but I just like the style how Kurt screams the song.Overall this is a good album. This record has its historical value. If you still haven't owned this then go get it right now.\n", "val": 0.17436599731445312}
{"text": "Emeril says that Kurt is responsible for the lame trends in \"Nu Metal, Pop Punk, Emo, Rap Metal, [and] Alternative.\"  Quite the statement!  I wish I knew what \"Nu Metal\" bands come straight from Nirvana.  If I knew of that band, I might give it a chance.  Since I ignore Nu Metal, though, I'll just have to guess that Emeril is just ignorant.  Same with \"Rap Metal.\"  When did Kurt ever rap?  Kid Rock comes from his Nirvana influence?  Hardly.  More like Hank, Jr. and AC/DC.  \"Emo\" and \"alternative\" were already alive and well before Kurt played his first show.  You're just talking about the lame bands that get called that, completely unoriginal bands like Blink 182 and Sugar Ray.  Kurt is hardly responsible for them.  As for good alternative and emo bands, Fugazi's first album was out before _Bleach_, and if you don't appreciate that, I have a hard time considering you a true fan of rock, \"grunge\" or otherwise.  Alternative music was thriving before Nirvana, with REM and U2 already topping the charts and many more to come.Blaming Nirvana for all the crappy music after them is like blaming Elvis for all of the crappy rock and roll after him.  _Nevermind_, while not as raw as _Bleach_ and not as sprawling as _In Utero_ was something quite original in its time, something brimming with the angst that many of us felt and had a hard time putting into words.  \"Something in the Way\" still makes me want to cry.  Sure, I'm bored with \"Teen Spirit\" by now, just like I am bored with \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand.\"  It doesn't make them bad songs; it makes them overplayed.

While, that in and of itself speaks to the magnitude of this material, quite of few of the reviews were missing something I had taken for granted as a 20 year-old college student in 1991. The ACTUAL effect this music had on the pop culture.I can remember the exact MOMENT I heard Smells Like Teen Spirit for the first time.  I was sitting in an outdoor bar/restauruant and the bartender began to play the CD.  A friend of mine and I went up to the bar and asked him what he had been listening to.  At the time, mainstream music didn't sound like that - period.  Flashy videos with attractive women and long guitar solos by guys in spandex had conquered the world and we were tired of it.  Some of us were fans of the Pixies, Sonic Youth, etc. and we were ready for change.I realize that younger fans might not understand the true change that took place at that time, but it was enormous.  Goodbye Warrant, Poison, Billy Idol, and Michael Jackson.  Hello Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains.  And as the years passed, the \"new\" sound became the \"old\" sound as countless bands tried to jump on the wagon.  All of this, can be traced to Nirvana and Nevermind.Regardless, younger fans that purchase this album - enjoy it.

{"text": "\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" - THE Rock Anthem. Now, perhaps the most overplayed song in Rock Bars along with \"Sweet Child O'Mine\".\"In Bloom\" - Funny lyrics, great chorus which takes a dig at people who love catchy choruses & riffs, but don't bother to understand the lyrics. Ironically, this particular song is ANYTHING but deep, meaningful or thought-provoking!\"Come As You Are\" - Great Song, Very Well-Written, Memorable Bass-Line which everyone and their mother recognises in less than second.\"Breed\" - Gives your subwoofer a great work-out. If Cobain is most well-known for his lyrics, this song isn't the one to showcase that.\"Lithium\" - They say Nirvana invented Quiet-Verse-Loud-Chorus. If true, then this song takes dubious honors for what's become of Modern Rock/Nu-Metal. And this song, is catchy as hell.\"Polly\" - GREAT GREAT Song. Any kid learning to play bass/acoustic would do well to start here. Also a great track to play acoustic while trying to impress your friends.\"Territorial Pissings\" - A lot of noise and furious drumming.\"Drain You\" \"Lounge Act\" - I don't find them special.\"Stay Away\" - A lot of screaming, furious drumming. Quiet Verse-Loud Chorus. Very average except for Dave Grohl.\"On a Plain\" - WOW! Now THIS, is a song that deserves to be honored and mounted on a pedestal, if possible. Very intelligent lyrics, great tune...\"Something in the Way\" - Melancholy with a beautiful Cello.It's hard to understand why this is called THE de-facto legendary album. I fell in love with Nirvana for their Unplugged performance and \"Heart-Shaped Box\". I wasn't around in 1991 (well, I was 6)....but i can think of a lot of great albums that came around that time (Metallica's Black Album, Ten)...Sure Nirvana must've had a unique sound back then and successfully transitioned from Alternative to the Mainstream. And this might even be 5-Star material considering its pretty good at what it does: flat-out power rockers with distorted guitars and the uber manifestation of teenage-angst [although the lyrics rarely ever talk about teenage-angst in particular]. Nirvana's Nevermind was a sonic experience that shook the paintings of the walls with its brash arrogance. But no, it is not the greatest record of all time. It doesn't reveal Kurt Cobain to be a great singer [for that, you have Unplugged in New York]. It isn't Kurt Cobain's best songwriting [For that, you have In Utero]. It definitely might be Dave Grohl's & Novoselic's best.Personally, if I was a 20-year-old back in 1991, I would be driving around in my car listening to \"Estranged\" by GnR, \"Jeremy\" by Pearl Jam, \"Sad But True\" by Metallica & \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Nirvana. In that order. But I guess I will contradict my own point when I say - \"Not the Greatest Songs ever made...but definitely some of the best to come together on one record\".Great but not the Greatest like people make it out to be.

{"text": "Having just read the journals of Kurt Cobain, I feel I have a new perspective on this phenomenal album, Kurt, and the group as a whole.  Kurt was extremely intelligent, caring, sensitive, a hard worker, and determined to secure his place in punk rock history.  And he did just that with his albums, Nevermind and In Utero.If you are a Nirvana fan but haven't bought the book, I would STRONGLY encourage you to!!  It is mesmerizing to see the actual hand-written pages photocopied from Kurt's Mead notebooks.  Many of the songs from Nevermind are scratched out in the notebook as he penned the lyrics.  Words are scribbled out and re-written.  Notes about what should be happening on the drums or guitar are jotted in the margins.  And even songs that never made it onto an album are handwritten on notebook paper.On one sheet of notebook paper, you can see where Kurt scribbled out the song layout for the album, Nevermind.  Beside each song, he wrote what mood the song portrayed.  It is obvious that he tried to balance the album with happy, sad, and mad.  And to the right of this list is a messy hand drawing of the album cover, dollar bill on a hook, baby swimming, etc.  According to his hand drawing, he initially wanted the words Verse Chrous Verse to appear on the album cover, but scratched it out and wrote Nevermind in it's place.So with that being said, I will further say that Nevermind is one of the two best (In Utero being the other) albums to be produced in rock history.  Kurt Cobain was a musical genius.  What this group did with the barest essentials of musical equipment is nothing short of amazing.  The words of each song scream out of the speakers with force and adrenaline and you can feel the mood through every guitar run.It is safe to say that no REAL rock fan's album collection is complete without at least a few Nirvana selections.

Everything off Nevermind is reverb'd up the ass. The glossiness of studio production is meant to ENHANCE what good there already is in a song.

The whole beauty of nirvana is the raw sound. It doesnt matter that its not complicated guitar solos Cause thats not wat matters.I wish i would have been old enough to go a concert. Once u learn what the lirics r it all comes together \"I feel stupid and contagoes here we r now entertain us\" perfect.Alot of people think that nirvana sux because kurts lyrics are about true things that he experienced. Not about other things. But isn't that wat music is about? expressing your emotions. thats wat kurt does and it tells a story of his life.Or mabye u hate it cause of the perfectness or because of the raw tune that does not change during the solos witch actully have more than instrument so its not a freakin' solo....some people think kurt was a bad person because of the drugs and suicide. but if u look beyond that u will see that he was a fun loving guy that loved his life(until he got on drugs)Also he never would have got on the drug seen if someone would have taught him about about the harmful effects of drugs.His mental ishues and abusive parents screwed him up. But his music was good...nninirnirvnirvanirvannirvananirvannirvanirvnirnin\n", "val": 0.012798112817108631}
{"text": "First off I want to make this clear. I have every Album by Nirvana including the box set. I even dressed up as Kurt Cobain during my schools homecoming week. I want you to know that this band is up there with The Beatles and U2 as the most overrated band ever. Most of Kurt Cobain's music sounds about as good as your alarm clock in the morning. The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because of Come as You Are (the only good song off this album). Smells Like Teen Spirit is a terribly overrated song which should have left the radio over 10 years ago. The only reason this song is still around is because everyone feels sorrow for Kurt Cobain because of his suicide. If you want to listen to good Grunge music pick up Alice In Chains' \"Dirt\" or Soundgarden's \"Badmotorfinger\". Nirvana had some all right material. I do like their later album \"In Utero\". But this is bull. Nirvana is the band known to define grunge but there is so much better artists out there. here is my list of the best grunge bands.1. Soundgarden2. Alice In Chains (my personal favorite but I have to hand it to Soundgarden).3. Black Crowes4. Pearl Jam5. Nirvana(honoralbe mentions are Meat Puppets, STP, and Samshing Pumpkins)So you can say my review is not helpful but just remember I'm not another fool dissing a band that I know nothing about. I probably know more about this band than you. But if insist on buying some Nirvana music pick up In Utero instead.\n", "val": 0.0002616842102725059}

{"text": "Nothing could have prepared the world for this incredible release.  Grunge is an amazing fusion of metal, punk and rock alternative that only Nirvana and Pearl Jam were ever able to really master.  Not since The Doors released their groundbreaking debut 25 years earlier had rock music taken such a dark step forward and broken so much new ground.  Metallica's, \"Kill'em All\", may have rewrote the rules for hard rock but Nirvana published those rule and displayed them to the public.Opening up with the unforgettable grunge anthem, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the album is a driving locomotive of hard rock and post-punk.  The video to that song was revolutionary and many like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan have tried to mimic it but failed completely.  Tracks like, \"In Bloom\", \"Come As You Are\", and \"Lithium\", have become post-punk standards but lesser tracks like the driving force, \"Breed\", and the absurd noise maker, \"Territorial Pissings\" are no less impressive.  \"Polly\", and, \"Something In The Way\" mark the quiet and mellow moments of the album, the latter being one of Kurt Cobain's most personal songs.  Sadly this is one of Cobain's only major statements as he only released a few more albums up untill his death in the mid 90's.The Doors and The Velvet Underground may have given birth to punk and hard rock, and The Clash and Sex Pistols may have made it popular but Nirvana revived it and gave it new life before others like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan made it suffer a second death. This along with Pearl Jam's, \"Ten\", and Green Day's, \"Dookie\", marked the pinnacle of 90's hard rock.  A must have for anybody interested in post-80's rock & roll.\n", "val": 0.027973515912890434}
{"text": "In 1991, a little band called Nirvana, whose only album in release was the little known punk record Bleach, released one of the greatest, most influential albums of all time: Nevermind. Nirvana's frontman, Kurt Cobain' held the reluctant voice of a generation, bringing a whole new style of music to the attention of the masses. Below are my scores for each individual song:Smells Like Teen Spirit- 5\\5: Nirvana's most famous song. Opens with a great power chord guitar riff that became the anthem for the nineties, accompanied by a fantastic scream-a-long chorus.In Bloom- 5\\5: Humorous and poignant, In Bloom is about the average dumb fan who doesn't understand Cobain's deep, introspective lyrics but pretends to like it anyway. The song proves to be a premonition, as thousands of Nirvana fans were later just like the one described in the song.Come As You Are- 5\\5: One of my favorites of theirs, it's one of Cobain's most emotional, with his powerhouse of a voice reduced almost to a whisper in certain places. A very powerful song, especially considering the band's tragic aftermath.Breed- 5\\5: For what's probably the only time, Kurt's voice isn't the star of the show, for instead Dave Grohl's lightning quick, pounding drumming takes center stage. One of their more punk rock songs, Cobain flexes his humorous songwriting skills some more in certain places.Lithium- 5\\5: Nirvana's funniest song, and their most sarcastic. A stunning contrast, however, is provided at the end when Kurt's angry howl takes over, jerking the mood from funny to angry to tragic and then, almost frightening.Polly- 5\\5: My personal favorite from them, it's about a girl who was kdnapped at a concert and raped, but escaped from her captor by pretending to enjoy the torture, tricking him into letting her free. Displays Cobain's feminine views in a shocking portrait, with Krist Novoselic's dark, eerie bass lines seeping their way into your mind.Territorial Pissings- 2.5\\5: The only real misstep on the album, Cobain's emotional, guttural voice just doesn't seem to have the power it does on the other songs.Drain You- 4.5\\5: Starts out extremely well with a very cool guitar intro that breaks into some powerhouse drumming from Grohl. Loses its intensity about halfway through, but then comes back for an amazing finish.Lounge Act- 5\\5: The only song on the album Cobain wrote about his ex-girlfriend Tobi Vail. It starts with Kurt's voice calm and collected, until its crescendo reaches a peak in which his voice becomes a huge, wailing howl. Simply brilliant.Stay Away- 4\\5: Another more punk rock sounding song, very intense, but starts to get repetitive towards the end.On A Plain- 5\\5: A very deep, insightful song about Cobain's dark childhood and thoughts about the relationships surrounding him. These brilliant lyrics are contrasted deeply with the surprisingly upbeat, bright guitar work. One of their catchiest.Something in the Way- 5\\5: The most tragic song Nirvana ever performed. It's about Kurt's lifestyle as a teenager and his having to live on the street. One of the most emotional songs ever recorded in the history of music.So, if you're looking for a place to start with Nirvana, be sure to pick up this one first. Not only is it them at their personal peak, but it's also undeniably the greatest album of the nineties but, in my humble opinion, the greatest album of all time.\n", "val": 0.022667046636343002}
{"text": "Someone should explain to the rest of us who appreciate great quality music such as Ratt,Guns n Roses etc. Why lack of talent seems to be mistaken as musical genious?Kurt Cobain was nothing more than a degenerate heroin addict who didn't even know 3 chords on guitar and certainly could not sing. This a perfect example of people buying garbage because they are too stupid to make up thier own minds ans MTV shoved this crap down everyone's throat because it was seen as being trendy. The ONE AND ONLY REASON this genre of music caught on was because every misfit who ever wanted to be in a band but didn't have the talent to play melodic metal and other kinds of music where you have to be able to sing and play saw that you could be a talentless loser like Cobain and get a reaction! This album and this music does not have a single redeeming quality I have never understood why people got into this crap there are no guitar solos(for those of you who listen to this stuff that is something played by talented musicians like Warren Dimartini and Geoerge Lynch),no hooks or melody to the songs and the vocals are absolutley terrible. For god sake don't buy this or anything like it,instead help all of us real rockers who like having a good time support hair metal! The only tragedy to Kurt Cobains death is that it didn't occur a few years earlier. By the way I gave this one star because Amazon said I had to rate it with at least a 1. If it was up to me I wouldn't rate it as high as a pile of petrified dog sh#t.\n", "val": 5.7346682297065854e-05}
{"text": "Can you believe it has been nearly 14 years since this multi platinum album hit the shelves?Nevermind is one of those true classic albums, right up in the ranks with \"Dark Side Of The Moon\" and even \"SGT.Peppers\".Nevermind has a variety of speedy punk pace songs to slow heavy grungy melodies. Nevermind basically introduced us to the world of grunge and since then many bands have followed.(Breaking Benjamin,The Vines,Bush)Many of Nirvana's radio hits came off this album. Such as \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\",\"Come As You Are\",\"Lithium\",In-Bloom\"and \"On A Plain\".Although \"On A Plain\" was never a single it still got some air play. Of those listed songs, no one can forget how \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" became the teen angst ridden anthem of the 90's. Whats nice about Nevermind is the fact that you can pop it in today and it will still sound as crisp as it did back in the day.(Wich really wasn't that long ago).A slower but notable song \"Something In The Way\" is introduced on this album and is a depressing conclusion to such a powerful album.\"Polly\"is an acoustic ballad and has a haunting but soft tone to it.\"Territotial Pissings\"is flaunting a punk sound.Nirvana ,with the help of Butch Vig, produced one timeless classic never falling short of dullness.

(Not all that great)But I'm not trying to take anything away from Nirvana.  They were good.  But just because Kurt wimped out and killed himself doesn't mean we have to hear their songs 11 years later every second of the day.  Their not that great.

It was time to start a new music rev. anyway, who the hell wants to listen to hair bands until they are fifty years old??Yes i know kurt was depressed and everything but you have to remember, he is way better than the crap emo, punk, and otehr junk we have today, you can at least give him credit for that... and NO he did not start this stuff... the teenage fags started this type of music... don't get me wrong now, i LUV metal and 80s as well. METALLICa all the way!!! But, this cd is a classic period... and yes they are my number ONE fav. band (nirvana is, not metallica lol)Anyway, the cd full of good guitar thrashing and great tunes for any young person to start listening to. The lyrics are great, sound is perfect, and the ways the songs run are great!! My favorite song by Nirvana would be \"Come As You Are\" and there is a hidden song on this CD. If you have the first released copies of Nevermind that came out in 1990-1991, you have it. Play the song \"Soemthing In The Way\" and let it play even after it goes off. skip forward until it gets to about the 19-20 minute mark. then a special song called \"Endless, Nameless\" will play. This song is very cool and is full of guitar smashing. I personally do not know how the hell kurt plays this song but it sounds \"Fanique.\" They say it was a outtake or demo of the song \"Lithium\" that they messed up on in the studio but im not sure... The song talks about his parents, yet he is screaming it the whole time, you cant really understand it much... Besides these two, the CD has very good songs and stuff on it. Overall the Cd is very good and every rock fan or whatever should get a copy... i HIGHLY recommend it...By the wat my fav. Nirvana songs off of here are: Smells Like Teen spirit, In Bloom, COME AS YOU ARE (#1), Breed, Lithium, Terr. Pissings, Drain You, Lounde Act, Stay Away, and ENDLESS, NAMELESS (hidden song after \"something in the way.\")\n", "val": 0.025926202535629272}
{"text": "At the time this album came out I was graduating high school, going into the college. My favorite music was and still is hard rock and metal. As a guitarist I was influenced by REAL PLAYERS like Eddie Van Halen, George Lynch, etc. I never liked this album. When Rolling Stone Magazine did a 100 greatest guitar player list they ahad the nerve to put Cobain higher on the list than Eddie Van Halen. His guitar playing sucks and so does his singing. These whiny songs brought about the crappy grunge movement with other crappy bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. Cobain has been compared to the likes of John Lennon, how can that be? He wasn't around long enough and he was just a druggie who got lucky. Being married to Courtney Love doesn't say much for him either, no wonder he killed himself. The 90's became a bleaker place because of this band. To this day I still don't understand why MTV and the record industries kissed their ass and tossed aside real talented bands. I don't know what they were smoking in Seattle but at least they produced some good bands like Queensryche and Heart.\n", "val": 0.0001183107087854296}

No matter what someone's belief is, any American citizen should be able to handle it, whether they disagree with it or not. Sure, I don't think there should be discrimination against anyone either, but when you have ethnic minorities being handed jobs and college admission just because of the color of their skin, then that's discrimination too (but colleges like to call it \"quotas\"). Affirmative Action is bad, plain and simple. It rewards people for their appearance rather than their skills. Nirvana was a band that was totally for bullsh*t like that; I can't believe he wrote in the Incesticide liner notes that he wanted his fanbase restricted to just people who think like him. Maybe if Cobain laid off the heroin he would have realized that he could have shared his views with those who think differently from him, and then they could have been enlightened. But the roadblock there would have been the fact that Cobain never wrote anything enlightening, socially or otherwise.And since when do gays and colored people need a rank junkie to speak for them?

A combination of these sounds is what led to the zeitgeist hit \"Nevermind\".Although I believe that the songs on this album are just simple beats with awkward lyrics, the power of Cobain's voice and his guitars are what made this album such a groundbreaker.\n", "val": 0.02481590025126934}
{"text": "I think everyone goes through a Nirvana phase at some point. In early adolescence, nothing channels your frustration like the powerful attack of Kurt, Krist and Dave. For a time, Nirvana is the greatest band in the world. Then you grow up a little, listen again, and realize that they were making fun of kids like you all along. You have a good chuckle, dig the album out from time to time, and place other bands atop the pantheon of rock and roll.To be sure, there's lots to love about Nevermind. From the clever mockery of Boston's \"More Than A Feeling\" on \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" to the haunting licks of \"Come As You Are\" and the manic drumrolls throughout, this album contains many classic moments. Great bands emerge partly from the distinctness of each member, and Nirvana fulfills this prerequisite easily. Krist Nivoselic provides fluid and melodic basslines, and David Grohl, though not technically exceptional, attacks the drums with incredible force and command. Kurt fulfills his role by regularly stumbling onto unforgettable hooks.At its best, Nirvana is an unstoppable force of raw power and wit. Few bands approach rock with such economy and purpose. When the opening chords of \"In Bloom\" crash through my stereo, I know that every sound the band makes will be deliberate and significant. The album's best song, \"Lithium,\" sychronizes simple mellow strumming with a fantastic crescendo, wicked snarling, and some of Kurt's most ironic and clever lyrics.Given this high praise, why do I not give this album five stars? There are two main reasons. The first is that the band does not maintain its high standard throughout the entire record. \"Breed,\" \"Territorial Pissings\" and \"Stay Away\" are virtually the same song, and \"Lounge Act\" and \"On a Plain\" also bear uncomfortable resemblance to one another. Attempts to incorporate some punk authenticity into the record, they sound like B-sides that never received full consideration or development. Some people view \"Polly\" and \"Something in the Way\" as brilliant and haunting ballads; I find that on this record they reveal the one-dimensionality of Cobain's voice. When I listen to a truly great album, I find that each listen gives me a new understanding of some element or sublety that I hadn't noticed before. That quality is missing from Nevermind. It is good, angry music for the car, but does not really reward multiple listens.The album's other major flaw comes from Kurt Cobain's inner turmoil. Much as he wanted to challenge the shallow focus of pop music at the time, he wrote music that was ultimately as meaningless as what came before it. Nihilism does not make for good listening. Cobain does not rail against the system, does not call for an uprising of the underprivileged, nor does he celebrate what's right with the world. Nevermind is as silly and flippant as its title suggests. The lyrics \"Love myself better than you/I know it's wrong/What should I do,\" sarcastic or not, simply cannot have emotional resonance. It's a shame that a band with so much talent squandered it making a meaningless record.\n", "val": 0.014156779274344444}

Is that when he's on heroin or coke?  In the drug crazed world of the Seattle grunge scene of the 1990s, everybody was too stoned to see Kurt \"Somebody Please Tell Me Where I Am\" Cobain for what he really was----a filthy, unbathed, dirty looking lowlife----out of his mind on drugs----who wrote inane lyrics while playing the same three chords on his noisy, muddy, out of tune, distorted guitar.  \"Wow duuuuuuuuudes!  Nirvan is like totally deep!  I can't understand anything he sings, so that must mean he's saying something profound...\"  Most blatently hypocritical of all is the fact that this whiney, noisemaking @ss.hole became a filthy rich, multi millionaire, even as he moaned and groaned about the evils of commercialism.  Hey Nirvana fans, tell me this.  If Kurt really was so hardcore anti mainstream, than why did he make so many videos for MTV?  Why did he perform live on MTV and Saturday Night Live?  Why did he sign multi million dollar, major label record deals?  No answers to these and many other questions?  The answer is simple, Nirvana were not a real band.  They were just a corporate creation designed to exploit a trend and make their record company a fortune.  Nirvana were the Linkin Park of the 1990s.  Their music was so soulless and corporate, they might as well have dressed in suits and ties on stage.  I'm barely even old enough to remember that g0d awful piece of sh.it band Nirvana, but I still remember all the teenagers of the 90s all going around claiming that Kurt was the \"voice of a generation\".  Yeah right, Kurt was the voice of his record company and nothing more.  Even at the young age of eight years, I thought Nirvana were dirty looking, musically amateurish, and mostly a product of mass media promotion.  Fifteen years has only confirmed that opinion more than ever before.  Its just so blatently obvious to me now.  Nirvana were a soulless, watered down, mass produced, corporate marketing machine.  What Linkin Park is to the 21st century, Nirvana were to the 90s.  In fact, I think the members of LINKIN PARK are reincarnated versions of nirvana.  JUST LIsten to how similar these two bands sound----whiney vocals that explode into raging screams, walls of distorted guitar noise, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is.  If it weren't for that DJ shredding his nails on the chalkboard, I wouldn't even be able to tell the difference.  In fact, there is only one good thing about Nirvana----Kurt blew his head off.

{"text": "This is the greatest album ever put onto plastic, and I will argue that fact with anyone, anywhere anytime. Nothing has meant more to more people then the twelve special tracks that grave Nevermind. I could go into the particulars of the album, and break every song down one by one, and believe I have so much to say about everyone one of them, but I won't. I think it is distasteful for a peon like me to try and tell the world the meaning to a masterpiece. The album is simple, I can play the whole thing on guitar (I'm not an amazing guitar player by any means.) and I can sing it word for word. There is just something so magical about this release. I don't have to tell you how it changed the world, made music about emotion instead of girls in thongs. Made you focus on energy instead of pyro and spandex, and forced bands to write a damn song instead of a shout out loud every one bounce up and down chorus. This record is one of the single greatest influences in my life, it made me focus on substance instead of flash, and I would recommend it to anyone. In fact I've given away at least nine copies of the album because I feel that if you have a CD player you should have Nevermind. This album sounds as good today as it did in its release, for some reason these songs just really don't get old. You might listen to \"Polly\" twenty times and get sick of it, but an hour later you realize that you're singing \"drain you.\" Chances are if you are reading this review you are a fan like me and are just curious as to what other people think of this record. Well I love it. And if you really enjoy this album go out and get the DVD about it's recording.

{"text": "I was anxious about this album when I bought it, I hoped it would be good but I had doubts, man was I blown away! Nevermind is a monumental album, it set standards and created a huge following for the grunge rock genre. Kurt Cobain was a genius, there is no doubt but let us not forget about Dave Grohl and Chris Novaselic, equally good musicians. Nirvana really was the greatest rock band ever and Nevermind reminds us of how in a few short years they shaped rock music and accomplished so much.Every song on this album is terrific, it contains many classics and shows off Nirvana's talents. The first track has to be the most well known song by this band. Smells Like Teen Spirit is pure genius. The lyrics are perfect and so are the vocals. The chorus is just superb. I love this song so much, it's great. In Bloom is another 'standard' from this album and like the song before it, it has a great chorus. Again also a classic. Come As You Are is a more laid-back track and not as energetic as Teen Spirit and In Bloom. I really like Kurt's vocals on this track.Breed is classic Nirvana, killer rifs and superb writing, it's a really energetic and fast paced song. The chorus is again great.It may start off a bit slow but soon Lithium gets paced and really packs a punch. The guitar is great on this track.Polly shows Nirvana's softer and acoustic side. The song is really haunting. The next song may be short but is a standout on this album and contains Grohl's superb incredibly fast drums and Kurts screams. The song overall is great.Drain You is a classic rock song where surprisingly the verse is better than the chorus. It starts off with Novaselic's trademark bass line and moves in all directions but overall a great song, that's Lounge Act. Stay Away is Nirvana and probably the catchiest song on the album and has great echo/response sections to it. On A Plain is quite experimental in which Kurt sings \"I love myself better than you\". This paves the way for a spectacular ballad, Something In The Way. It contains a superb cello and Kurt's voice is full of longing and emotion.Anyway you look at this album you realise what an impact it had on society. Nirvana were tragic talents, Kurts death was a shock to the industry and will remain a huge loss forever. They may have been around for less than a decade but they are now appearing on all sorts of 'best of all-time' lists.Amazing.\n", "val": 0.1361829787492752}

{"text": "The album that changed pop music!I remember well when it came out how dead rock had become. I loved classic rock but never understood the whole \"Metal\" thing.It seemed the idea behind most of the metal releases was to scare the listener with sound and image. I guess I heard SmellsLike Teen Spirt first but it didn't make the strong impression on me it did so many others. It took Weird Al to change my mind on that one. Then I think I heard Lithium next and it caught my ear. I new something was going on with this group in a very big and positive way but didn't understand it at all. It seemed at the time it was a generation X song and I was the last of the baby boomers and isolated from it.Then I heard Come As You Are and was completely hypnotized. Nothing has ever struck me the same before or since. For the first time in my life a really important band was in their heyday and I could be there to live it out with them. Maybe I might even get chance to see them in concert (never happened)! The song was mysterious, liberating and rejuvenating all at the same time. I rushed to again try to start-up another lost cause garage band. At anyrate, by that point I was completely sold on Nirvana as the best act since the early 70's.Not to take away from the other tracks which round out a perfected album. Breed, Polly, Drain You, On a Plain all major tracks  crucial to Nirvana's catalog. In Bloom also had a big impact on me at it's release. I thought somehow Kurt was talking to me when he said..\"he's the one that likes all our pretty songs and he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he don't know what it means..\". I'd never paid much attention to lyrics before and was completely baffled by Kurt's. It inspired me to listen and think more about what was being said. Territorial Pissings and Lounge Act being tracks that are often overlooked but truly stand out as excellant tunes.Something In The Way although a great soft acoustic song saturated with emotion seems somewhat out of place as does Polly. Polly, one of the groups oldest original songs, seems to appear on most Nirvana albums in different forms. In this track it's been recorded almost identically to the original demo. The acoustic treatment somehow brings out aspects of the song in overtones, etc., not heard in electric versions. Given the harsh, hard drive of most of the other tracks in this release the softer quieter tracks reflect the broad expanse of influence at work in the band.This disc changed my musical opinions and attitudes once I got familiar with it. A truly great listen!\n", "val": 0.00934665184468031}
{"text": "One thing I could never understand over the years is how so many people dispise this album. Nevermind is one of the greatest albums of the 90's, if not the greatest. Yeah, it's overrated, as many people call Nirvana as a whole, but that doesn't mean the album isn't genius. Just about every track on this CD is a masterpiece.The album starts off with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", which started the alternative revolution. Everything underground came up and was called as grunge. The song is a powerhouse, but every Nirvana fan will tell you it's not their best. Nirvana has better songs on Bleach (\"Love Buzz\"), Incesticide (\"Sliver\"), and In Utero (\"Serve the Servants\") Kurt Cobain got so fed up with the song, as it was so overrated when people came to their concerts that's all they wanted to hear, that he eventually stopped playing it live. (IMO he also wrote \"Rape Me\" because of it) Not to mention the \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" performance on The Muddy Banks of Wishkah is much better.\"In Bloom\" the song written about the guys who sing their songs but 'don't know what it means.' The song is another Nirvana classic and the music video is amazing (not the sub pop one)\"Come As You Are\" has one of Nirvana's classic riffs, even if Kurt Cobain did steal it from Killing Joke. (Although Nirvana's last drummer Dave Grohl did make it up to them by playing on one of their albums)\"Breed\" is one of my favorites off Nevermind. The song is lightning fast with great vocals.\"Lithium\" is one of the first Nirvana songs most people hear. The song has a guitar riff that is simply genius and I still get creeped out when I hear the chorus (even if he is only saying 'Yeah')\"Polly\" is a song that grows on you. The song details the story of a 14-year-old girl that was kidnapped and raped. When you first hear it you'll wonder why they put it on the album as it is much slower then the previous songs. Similiar to Stairway to Heaven, once you listen to it a few times you'll realize how great it is. And if you don't, then just listen to the faster \"(New Wave) Polly\" on Incesticide.\"Territorial Pissings\" is a song that even the Nevermind haters can like. The song is very similiar to Breed with Cobain screaming about finding a \"better way.\"\"Drain You\" is a really underrated Nirvana song. I consider the second best song on the album and it's simply amazing.\"Lounge Act\" is another underrated song which I believe is a perfect song. Although just about everyone won't agree with me, it is the greatest song on the album, if not the greatest by Nirvana. (Although \"Sappy\", \"Where Did you Sleep Last Night?\" and \"Do Re Mi\" come very close) The lyrics are amazing, with Kurt singing about being constrained in a relationship. Apparently Kurt's singing to a guy that was cheating on his girlfriend but interestingly the original lyrics say \"I'll go out of my way to prove I still smell him on you\" instead of \"her on you\" which completely changes the meaning of the song.\"Stay Away\" is another song comparible to Breed. It's very fast with Dave doing \"Bonzo\" triplets on the drums. However the original song, named \"Pay to Play\", which is in the box set has a better sound.\"On a Plain\" is an excellent song with some of Nirvana's best lyrics (I'll start this off without any words/I got so high I scratched till I bled/ I love myself better than you/ I know it's wrong so what should I do?) Although personally I prefer the MTV Unplugged version, this is great as well.\"Something in the Way\" along with \"Polly\" is a song that grows on you. It's a really soothing song that demonstrates Kurt Cobain's genius as a songwriter. He didn't have to scream to have a classic song.This is probably one of the only albums I own that I'd give every song a perfect score. Nirvana, Nevermind, and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" changed music history. Without Nirvana and the grunge revolution there wouldn't be a lot of the bands that exist today. So please, before bashing the album as Nirvana's \"Selling Out\" album, listen to it without bias and your personal dislike of everything mainstreamed. (I hate Courtney Love more than I hate Good Charlotte but I still think \"Live Through This\" is an amazing album.)\n", "val": 0.03882613033056259}

{"text": "\"1) Any band giving competition to Nirvana (Pearl Jam; Guns N Roses; Smashing Pumpkins) were insulted by Kurt Cobain for being \"corporate\", yet Nirvana made just as many music videos in their short time span as Nsync did for their first album, and did interviews with anyone, anywhere.. whereas most bands use the competition of other bands to try to make their music better, Kurt took the coward, immature way out and just insulted them to try to hurt their credibility\"1. Any band giving competition were given a fair trial. Kurt eventually made up and became friends with Eddie. Slash himself expressed admiration for Kurt Cobain and the feud was mostly with Axl who was a bit of a a$$ anyway. They only released music videos because of their popularity, four from Never Mind and one from In Utero. They made their name through relentless touring and word of mouth before hand.\"2) Kurt Cobain had no problem wearing a tshirt that says \"corporate magazines still suck\", and he had no problem calling MTV on his own time and telling them to play Nirvanas music videos more either.\"2. Maybe you don't realize it, but there's a difference between a  \"magazine\" and music television? And even if he did call MTV to play his videos more... He's trying to sell albums. Yes, he picked up a guitar for the music, but when your livelihood is music you want it to do well. To cap it all of his shirt about corporate magazines still sucking was a humorous self reference to his/Nirvana's own appearance in a corporate magazine.\"3) Nirvana did not have the whole world obsessed with their music, 'In Utero' sold 5 million copies... Im pretty sure the last Coldplay album sold the same amount. So why today, is he so idolized?\"3. Nobody said Nirvana has the world obsessed with their music...? And In Utero for being so abraisive and far removed from popular music sold exceptionally well. He's idolized for expressing the sentiments felt by many teens, Chris Martin is not. (Nothing against Chris, he's put out some decent music)\"4) Nirvana were not original. You know nothing about music. They were rip-offs of the Pixies. No excuses. No arguments. They were bigger Pixies wannabes than Puddle of Mudd is to Nirvana.\"4. Nirvana had some originality as even the biggest ripoff bands do, which Nirvana was not. They incorporated some elements of the Pixies, sure, but they had more influences than that like Sonic Youth, the Beatles, Black Sabbath, the Melvins, et cetera. They made it their own.\"5) Want to know why Nirvana was the first Seattle band to get huge? Because they had the mass marketing machine of David Geffen behind them - Geffen being willing to promote Nirvana to any level... basically the same thing done with Good Charlotte; Avril Lavigne;, anyone.\"5. Nirvana was the first Seattle band to become popular because it caught people's attention, that's all. Pearl Jam also had a mass marketing machine in the form of Epic Records, one of the oldest and integral parts of Sony. Likewise Alice in Chain with Columbia Records, and Soundgarden with A&M records. So basically any band that wanted to be heard was on a major label.\"6) Some people call Nirvanas music simplistic.. and Nirvana fans respond with 'So what?' - Ok... then let me say it differently.. Nirvans music isn't so much simplistic, as it is often very immature and teen-angst sounding.\"6. You're right some people call Nirvana simplistic. And simple music and melody doesn't make it any less effective or endearing. Immature? That's very subjective but I don't think so. They sang about things far from ordinary on the pop radar. Angst filled? Only Nevermind, which was in fact poked fun at by Cobain himself with the line \"Teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old\". It also doesn't explain how Nirvana's non-angsty records are regarded as classics: See MTV Unplugged in New York.\"7) Nirvana were NOT the Beatles of this generation.. the Beatles were original, no one really paved the way for the Beatles, the Beatles had no one to copy. no band has been the Beatles of this generation. The Beatles proved themself album after album after album after album. If 'You Know Youre Right' is any indication, Nirvana were going down hill FAST. Nirvana copied tons of bands (not INFLUENCED BY... JUST *COPIED*), tons of bands (guys in PEARL JAM (thats right), Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Mudhoney, the Melvins, and especially the Pixies all paved the way for Nirvana to be noticed. \"7. The Beatles had no one to copy? Rock music must have not exited prior to 1962? The Beatles were enthusiastic followers of Cliff Richards and the Shadows. Chuck Berry was also a huge influence. Most of the Motown and Rock 'N' Roll scene influenced the Beatles, the same way other bands influenced Nirvana. And using a You Know You're Right (a demo song not given proper studio treatment) is a bad indication of where the band was going, even if the song was great. Green River didn't have a profound effect on Nirvana at all, nor Pearl Jam. And yes, other bands paved the way for Nirvana to be noticed, but that's the way with all music.\n", "val": 0.00015133093984331936}

If I read this review, I'd think it were a review for a goth band or something. This isn't the Sisters of Mercy. There's humor on \"Nevermind\", which shows that Cobain did have some high points, whether you loved it or hated it.\"I blame them for inspiring (insert inferior band)\" --> Nice shot, but every band who makes it in the mainstream is bound to influence some people who don't have a clue or talent with their music. You may not like it for this reason but it's not that valid to why these guys \"aren't that good.\"\"The guitar playing isn't very good\"--> Well, it looks like you just need to open your mind: It's YOUR problem. Just because they aren't being complex doesn't mean anything. Listen to prog-rock bands for that; fans of it annoy me to begin with. Nirvana's inspired by PUNK, which is meant to be simple, and these songs have hooks and edge in them, which makes \"Nevermind\" so great.\"it's overproduced garbage, the other two albums are REAL Nirvana\" --> Sure, Cobain may have claimed to be ashamed of the production. But if you like albums such as \"Grace\" by Jeff Buckley which were also mixed by Andy Wallace, you suffer from HYPOCRISY. This actually brings a diversity to the band's music, where the other albums would've sounded a bit more same-y if done otherwise. I like how it's got that crystal-clear shining through, although it's probably not what Cobain wanted the album to be. It was really well recorded and that's why \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" still sounds wonderful in the context of this album.\"it isn't metal!!!\" --> Yeah, and what does it matter. Lots of Nirvana fans don't like metal anyway.I won't argue that it's highly regarded, but some of the people on this site are just being ridiculous. I also don't like how some people ignorantly judge the audience and THEN whine about how others judge them. Look at yourselves. This was influenced by the loud/soft dynamics of the Pixies, although it's not quite as quirky and a bit more pop-based. \"Nevermind\" is an album that is worth owning, even if people have blown its praises out of proportion. Either way, I think an even better choice would be \"MTV Unplugged in New York\". \"In Utero\" is great as well and is on roughly the same level as the album.

They really set the mood of my middle school days (since that's when they came out). While everyone loved them to death, I really didn't care and was just listening to Simon and Garfunkel. But as time went on, the Spice girls and the boy bands came out, I was just like, \"wait a minute, what happened to creativity?\" And then I started hearing what Kurt was saying through his music, as I went through my own teenage years of torment. It also didn't hurt to grow up in the same state Nirvana grew up in, therefore taking personally the feeling and the mood of their songs.It's sad that Nirvana is no more, but maybe it's best that David Grohl is now the frontman of his own group and Krist is in Olympia, WA as a political activist.

Suddenly we stopped having big hair and wearing flashy clothes, we suddenly saw the importance of being ernest.

This album is o.k. but I must say that it wears thinner and thinner with each repeated listen.  This is especially true of the second half of the album where they really seem to just be going through the motions and not putting much thought or effort into the songs.  I went back and listened to this album again after seeing it at the top of so many \"greatest album of all time\" lists because I thought that maybe I was missing something.  It turns out that I wasn't.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few really solid songs on this album. The first part of the album is stacked up well.  The first three songs are catchy, solidly written mid-tempo rockers that do a really effective job of capturing angst, frustration, and other feelings resulting from disaffection.  The fourth track \"In Bloom\" is in a similar vein but this intense and frenetic track rocks out even harder.  The stripped down (for the most part; intense multi-layered chorus and bridge not included) presentation of \"Lithium\" allows Cobain's lyrics to stand out and be even more effective.  He impressively makes effective use of sarcasm to get his point across on this track.  The next track \"Polly\" however is one of the lamest songs that I have ever heard and the rest of the album pretty much ranges from solid and impressive (Lounge Act) to derivitave of the band's own material (Stay Away, Drain You) to insanely repetitive and empty (Territorial Pissings).  Getting to \"Something in the way\" makes listening to many of the lesser tracks worth it though.  This slower paced track with its outstanding vocals and moody string arrangement is this album's true hidden gem.  This album is an o.k. effort and if that's all it was made out to be, then that would be, well...o.k.  But, this album is made out to be one of the top 20 greatest albums of all time and that is a crock of you know what.  There were quite a few better albums released in the 90's even, although \"Nevermind\" is far from the only offender when it comes to overrated 90's albums.  Truthfully, there were better albums released by \"The Posies\", \"Radiohead\", \"Prince\", \"Public Enemy\" and numerous other hip hop acts for that matter, and well...Nirvana (In Utero).  Historical impact is often cited as the reason that this album is rated so highly.  I say that's a crock of you know what.  What exactly is historical impact?  Is it record sales and media presence, or is it the influence that it had on changing the face of music by starting or more realistically, popularizing a new genre of music?  So why aren't other albums in other genres rated so highly for doing the same thing, and what does any of that have to do with the material itself?  I think that this album is rated so highly due to a severe case of the \"monkey-see, monkey-do's\".  So anyway, this album is basically a truly solid effort, it's just not mind-blowingly excellent like some would have you believe.\n", "val": 0.030222153291106224}

{"text": "First off, I must say that I owe Nirvana. A lot. If it wasn't for them and this album, I'd probably be floating along on the by now DANGEROUSLY plastic, fake corporate radio waves, knowing that there was something missing, but never finding out WHAT.Thanks to Nirvana, I've been exposed to bands like The Wipers, Mudhoney, Scratch Acid, Bikini Kill...which has led me to delve deeper into the indie/experimental musical landscape of then and now. Basically, I owe Nirvana my very musical \"life\".That being said, I personally think that Kurt's best songwriting was on In Utero, and in songs like \"About a Girl\", \"All Apologies\", and \"Aneurysm\". However...Nevermind is undeniably an essential part of any record collection. It's an essential part of the history of music in the 20th century. Without this album and the (by now grossly overplayed, but still seminal and brilliant) track \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" to act like a lightning rod, it's very likely that the other wonderful bands like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, etc. would've languished in obscurity...or reached less success than they did.So...I don't care if some upstart little snot-nosed kid of today is deaf to what this band meant. I don't care if some rabid Pearl Jam fan is sporting a 14+ year-old grudge due to a pointless musical rivalry. Whether you preffer other albums to it or not, you still have to admit that Nevermind was and is an incredible record, and a vital piece of the history of the 90's. Whatever happened after (and whatever the media did to exploit it) shouldn't eclipse the importance of the record.So...buy it, listen to it, enjoy it...and if you don't, then pass it on to someone who does. This is 'Alternative' before the label was applied to the music...before other bands tried to capitalize on its popularity and hop on the bandwagon...before 'grunge' became a fashion. This is where it broke.An important notch on any musical calendar.P.S: And to hate a band because others like them, and put down their record on a site like this is just childish and stupid. Why not go promote the records you like instead of wasting your time trying to put another down? Please, grow up.

Now for the songs:SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT was the biggest hit from this album. COME AS YOU ARE was another hit. I also like IN BLOOM,BREED and SOMETHING IN THE WAY. This album inspired \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's OFF THE DEEP END album,released in 1992. That album contains SMELLS LIKE NIRVANA which is a parody of SLTS. When Yankovic sings \"a garage band from Seattle\",he refers to Nirvana. The cover photo(from this album) is actually X-rated. There's a naked male baby under swimming pool water intending to grab a dollar bill attached to a hook and fishing line. Sure,it would have been controversial if it was an adult. On the OTDE cover,Yankovic spoofs the NEVERMIND cover by grabbing a donut attached to a hook and fishing line. And yes,Yankovic is wearing a bathing suit. In one of the photos contained in this album,the band's late frontman Kurt Cobain \"flips the bird\". Cobain's fame only lasted over two years,as he committed suicide in April 1994. Surviving are his wife rocker/actress Courtney Love who's a member of Hole and their daughter Frances Bean,who is currently about 12 or 13 years old. Cobain's death put an end to Nirvana,and another Nirvana member,Dave Navarro,subsequently co-founded and co-formed Foo Fighters. This album was distributed by DGC,which is an acronym for David Geffen Company. DGC's sister label is simply,Geffen which was founded in 1980.

Only in the 90s could an unstable dopehead calling himself 'Kurdt' be hailed as a 'genius' and a 'brilliant songwriter'.  Kurt Cobain a brilliant songwriter?  Is that when he's on heroin or coke?  In the drug crazed world of the Seattle grunge scene, everybody was too stoned to see Kurt Cobain for what he really was----a filthy, unbathed, dirty looking lowlife----out of his mind on drugs----who wrote inane lyrics while playing the same three chords on his noisy, muddy, out of tune, distorted guitar.  \"Wow dudes!  These lyrics sound like, totally deep!  I can't understand anything he sings, so that must mean he's saying something profound...\"  Most blatently hypocritical of all is the fact that this whiney, noisemaking nitwit became a filthy rich, multi millionaire, even as he moaned and groaned about the evils of commercialism.  Hey Nirvana fans, tell me this.  If Kurt Cobain really was so underground and hardcore, than why did he make so many videos for MTV?  Why did he perform live on MTV and Saturday Night Live?  Why did he sign multi million dollar, major label record deals?  I'll tell you why.  It is because Nirvana nothing more than a group of hypocrites, out to make money off an obnoxious pop culture fad.  Kurt Cobain was a phoney who didn't stick to his principles!  He lived a double standard.  He would say one thing and do something completely different at every turn.  He called other artists 'sellouts' even though he was making millions and millions of dollars selling this garbage he called 'music'.  Nirvana were nothing but a corporate rock hit machine tailor made by a record company to exploit a fad.  Face it people, Nirvana were the Backstreet Boys of 1992!  The fact that such a blatent corporate marketing scam like Nirvana is still popular over a decade after Kurt Cobain ate that shotgun barrel is a testament to the power of marketing.  If you buy into all the hype about Nirvana 'saving rock n roll' or 'killing off hair metal', than you my friend, are a sucker!  As PT Barnum once put it, \"There's a sucker born every minute!\"  And all the people who think Nirvana saved rock are exacxtly that----SUCKERS!!!  Nirvana had no talent what so ever.

People thought this unbathed appearence made them the \"anti hair band\", when in fact they were manufactured by their record company, like a 90s version of Linkin Park!  The music they performed was nothing but complete and pointless noise pollution, and there's no way it ever would have sold without all that hype.

{"text": "Kurt Cobain, a guy who listened to his Vaselines and Wipers records and his Black Flag and Melvins records and decided he wanted melody and anger and speed and ferocity. Of course, there's nothing strange about this. Many people want to do things like this. And, just like Lou Reed could apply Burroughs lyrics to Ornette Coleman backing, Cobain was lucky enough to be able to combine his influences. So what he did was write some pop songs with a bleaker lyrical outlook on life and a meaner musical backing. Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic were there to give his songs above-average rock instrumentation.  Nevermind was the first bubblegum/hardcore fusion and it worked in the bands favour. Smells Like Teen Spirit is a hit. The work is done. Marry a rock-star wife, take up junk, blast yourself, become immortalised in rock history. God Bless Cobains family, it's a tragedy he got so caught up in success. When thinking about these things, it's a good idea to listen to The Smiths song 'Paint A Vulgar Picture'... gee I've lost my point.... NEXT PARAGRAPH.  So Q Magazine readers voted this The Greatest Album Of All Time back in January 2003. Balderdash. Pure and utter balderdash. Cobain had a decent melody or two, but he was no poet. The lyrics are but shallow, meaningless couplts knocked off so he'd have something to sing that sounded 'depthful' and 'artistic'. In reality they're random words that sound good together. I think, deep down, Cobain may have been lying when he wrote 'I'd rather be dead than cool' in 'Stay Away'. If you want a top-class Cobain work, richer lyrically and musically, get In Utero. Nevermind is a stepping stone. A man of great talent on the road to artistic maturity. There was something in the way alright, but soon he blew it out of his way and went on to write accomplished works like 'Scentless Apprentice', 'Very Ape' and 'Serve The Servants'.  I am not, I repeat, not saying Nevermind is a bad album. It's an above-average early nineties classic. It's better than most in its league. It beats a lot of its derivatives, though Nirvana came nowhere near The Wipers in terms of pure mastery of craft. Greg Sage was the man behind the genius of The Wipers and if you want great pop-punk buy the first three Wipers albums, three complete masterpieces, available in one box-set. So, if you don't own Nevermind, buy it, forget about the myth and just enjoy it's simplicity and pop-appeal. Eventually you'll get tired of it, then you can buy In Utero, which you won't ever tire of, if you're like me. Overall, Nevermind makes quite a soundtrack to adolescence.

There is much more in the USA than patriotism, naivity and mendacity. This band is a demonstration of truth and real feelings. When I think of this music, I have a much better opinion about the USA! Music can handle such things and Nirvana made it, at least by me.Nirvana isn't just Rock, Nirvana isn's just a band, which created Grunch, Nirvana is more than just music! Nirvana is the feeling of being alive, Nirvana can make people believe in something, who didn't believe in anything before, Nirvana is my religion! People, who really try to understand this, won't be able to hate this music...\n", "val": 0.02442053146660328}

{"text": "What's up with Nirvana?  I don't get it.  Not a single shrieking, whammy-bar afflicted guitar solo.  No operatic metal vocals.  Sorely lacking in their repertoire of songs relating food items to female reproductive organs.  No super-model girlfriends.  I don't think Curt Koburn's guitar was outfitted with a Floyd Rose system or a locking nut.  Christ Novorselack didn't play a Warlock bass, and Dade Growl never broke for extended drum solos (although he had an awesome last name).  And, as far as I know, that untalented hack Kurk Coblain never even used hairspray (!).  They never had a video with Tawny Kitaen doing cartwheels across luxury European automobiles.  Seriously, not a single one.  Shocking, I know.These guys killed real rock!  You know, since real rock music requires a metric ton of makeup and hair accessories after all.  Just like Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and Elvis Presely envisioned it.All kidding aside, I'm a musician and I like Nirvana.  Plus, I don't suck if I say so myself.  I use the solo from \"Another Brick In The Wall Pt. II\" to warm up, for one.  Nirvana's music couldn't be easier to play, but it doesn't change what I think about them.  I love Nirvana because I'll be damned if Dokken, Malmsteen, Whitesnake, Vai, Satch, Cinderella, or Twisted Sister ever excited me the way Nirvana did.  If they're so worthless, how come blowhards like Vince Neil hate them to this day?  I bet a lot of the hair metallers were probably just bitter about the fact that a visceral, powerful (ie \"real\") rock band was causing them to lose money that would normally be going straight up their noses.

{"text": "The people who claim Nirvana is bad are mostly people who hate the mainstream music of today, very few people who hate Nirvana have actually heard all their albums. But thats beside the point, I've come to write a review on the MUSIC, not the impact (and I don't even believe it was Nirvana who started the crap of today, I think it was Korn).  While this CD is most definitely good, it isn't as great as some people say it is. I own a copy and of the twelve songs, six of them are good/great, 4 of them decent/average, and 2 that suck. The 6 good songs are 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'In Bloom', 'Come As You Are', 'Lithium', 'Lounge Act', and 'Ona Plain'. The average songs are 'Polly', 'Territorial Pissings', 'Drain You', and 'Something In The Way'. The crap is 'Breed', and 'Stay Away'.  Every r&r fan has heard Teen Spirit, and most have heard Come As You Are, Lithium, and In Bloom, the are all good songs and have great basslines and songwriting. On A Plain has some of Kurts best songwriting ever, but the chorus could have improved, and Lounge Act has one very catchy (and good) bassline. Polly and Something in the Way are both very good ballads with deep, meaningful lyrics about Kurts past and hometown. The crap songs are the only reason why this doesn't get a five star rating, but hey, nobody's perfect.  Now, as a Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix fan, you would expect me to hate this because of Kurts bad guitar playing, but what he didn't do well in guitar and vocals, he made up for in songwriting and lyrics, which is why he's so great. Kris Novoselic has made a few great basslines in his time, so while he isn't great he's still good. And Dave...I think we can all agree that Dave Grohl is one of the all-time great drummers in rock.  Overall this would probably score a high 3 or low 4....And oh yeah, to that guy who said that Creed and Nickelback were grunge, you should be beaten badly for writing that, joke or no joke.\n", "val": 0.002737035509198904}

{"text": "No album ever had such a grandiose impact on music culture and the industry as Nevermind did. Following the release, sales exploded for this album, and also enabled upcoming alternative bands to finally get their moment of fame. I wanted to avoid the Guns n Roses Nirvana feud, so I'll just state that Cobain was a selfish, ignorant human being responsible for some of the bashing put towards an incredible metal band that highly influenced Nirvana in many ways. That being said, he knew how to pen an incredible rock song, produce inducing guitar hooks, which were catchy beyond imagination, and highly contribute to the release of one of the greatest rock albums of all time.Opening with a song that in many ways defined rock for the 90s, Smells Like Teen Spirit is viciously punk infused rocker, with a guitar riff that's catchy as hell. However, I myself am more fond of the powerful follow up In Bloom, with its downkey guitar smashing and explosive drums creating a delicious rocker(my favourite). Come As You Are opens as a dark, disturbing tune, breaking into another classic rocker which ultimately earned a great deal of airplay and still does. Breed is simpler, very fast paced and punk influenced. Lithium was arguably the second biggest hit on the album, with the awesome chorus, and captivating guitar melody through the verses of the song. Polly is a darker side of Nirvana, in a sense showing Cobain exploring with a more delicate tune with great effectiveness. Territorial Pissing is a dangerous rocker, with speedy drums from Grohl and an awesome lyrical delivery. Drain You stays with the consistency of the rest of the album, another solid rocker. Lounge Act lacks some of the rock righteousness that was perfectly executed in the tracks prior to it. Nevertheless, it isn't worthy of a skip. Stay Away certainly provides more energy, opening similarly to Territorial Pissings with the drums, and building into just another great rock song, which is basically in summary the truth to this album. Ending with the most depressing song on the tracklisting, Something In The Way, we hear a most disturbing lyrical delivery, with a gripping chorus.Overall rock n' roll fans cannot pass up this album, easily a landmark album in rock history which still resonates through music today. Sadly it was taken the wrong way, and music culture was ultimately destroyed by disgusting interpretations. Highly Recommended to all.\n", "val": 0.04322216659784317}

{"text": "Warning; This is more of a rebuttal to negative reviews and less an in depth analysis of \"Nevermind.\"Its really phenomenal how, for so many people, \"Nevermind\" is the most offensive album ever created. Its completely devoid of any real pretensions or political statements yet it inspires considerably more hatred than Oasis, Rage or Eminem combined. I don't know how most people are, but when I encounter a boring or distasteful record, I casually dismiss it. When someone asks what I think of Lenny Kravits, I tell them \"he doesn't really do it for me.\" Not \"they are the embodiement of all that is evil\" and certainly not \"Im glad that/hope they committ depression induced suicide for forcing their horrible music unto me.\" In this regard, its obvious that most people uniquely despise Nirvana because they are \"overrated.\"I'll be the first to say that Cobain is a mediocre guitar player. I was just as insulted as the next man when Rolling Stoned put him in the top twenty all-time. It would be folly in the extreme to call him a mediocre musician, though. There is more to good music than technical mastery. The Pixies, the Clash, Janes Addiction: None of these bands featured particularly amazing guitarists but they succeed anyway on INGENUITY. Dont get me wrong, I love bands like Dream Theater, Rush, or Led Zeppelin. But there is something to be said for a band that succeeds by focusing its energy on songwriting rather than jamming and intrumental prowess.Like the Ramones before them, Nirvana was being experimental. They wanted to strip grunge down to its bear essentials: chords and melody. To make an interesting album with these as your only parameters is difficult. Its not an option for the songwriter to include ornamental \"tricks\" such as weird rhythms, cool riffs, or song structure in making the album more original. He must explore the very essance of melodic and chordal structure and screw around with it. This is what Nirvana does. Their hooks are undeniably catchy yet they don't resolve in any traditional sense. Ideas such as leading tones or dissonant tension, instinctual for most songwriters (Including Pearl Jam who are decent and The Pixies who are fricken amazing), are thrown out the window by Cobain. As for the whole \"he didn't know what the hell he was doing\" accusation, he obviously knew what sounded good. The man listened to the Beatles and he was aware of the departure his music was making from mainstream pop. YES, Nirvana stole from The Pixies but (gasp) the infallible Pixies stole from Billy Idol and David Bowie. Its funny how other reviwers cite Gouge Away as the template for \"Nevermind.\" Compare Gouge Away to White Wedding and you'll find an even closer similarity. Does this make The Pixies hacks.

{"text": "I can't overstate the fact that this album defined a generation for about only two or three years. Later releases were met with empathy but nothing really matched this album's boom. \"Nevermind\" is the quissential model for Nirvana's career, style-wise: simple music with good lyrics and a mellow overtone, no matter how heavy the music may be. A very good album, but nothing really spectacular. Everyone says that Nirvana were ground-breaking, but there were obviously those before them that did the same thing, but get no credit. That will always happen in the music industry. Quiet Riot were the first hair band to get signed to a major record label, but it didn't make them better than Guns N' Roses. And when I say 'overrated', it doesn't necissarily mean that it's bad. I think this album is good, but not to the extent that people put it over to be. To say that this is the best album in the last 25 years is ludicrous. All I am really saying is look at the mainstream icons of rock and roll: the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, (unfortunately) U2, the Doors, Black Sabbath, and most importantly, the Beatles. I would not lump Nirvana in this group at all. Cobain's lyrics may have been good, but I doubt he could have written something like McCartney's \"Yesterday\" when he was 18 years old.\n", "val": 0.028650997206568718}

{"text": "I just wasted ten minutes of my life reading the review below from \"Velvet Underground Pixies\" about how everything Kurt did was a \"rip-off\" of somebody that he liked, and how everything Eddie Vedder has ever done is \"real\" and \"truth\".  So...First off, Pearl Jam only exists because Andrew Wood is dead.Andrew Wood was TEN TIMES the singer Eddie Vedder is.  Andy's lyrics run circles around Vedder's all day long.Andy didn't care who thought what of him, he wanted to be a rockstar and didn't care who knew.  Vedder can't flush his own feces down the toilet without worrying about if he just sold-out because everyone else flushes the toilet too.But this isn't about Mother Love Bone (superior band) and Pearl Jam (inferior), this is about Nirvana (far superior).Nevermind isn't as good an album as In Utero.I prefer In Utero's raw emotion, but Nevermind would be most any other band's crowning achievement (and there could have been no In Utero without a Nevermind before it).Kurt Cobain, like most human beings, was influenced by things that he heard, saw, smelled, touched etc.  The Pixies being one of the bands that Kurt was influenced by.  He was also influenced by the Beatles, Black Sabbath, Vaselines, Cheap Trick, the Germs (you're starting to get the point).To call Nirvana a blatant rip-off of the Pixies is like calling Mountain Dew a blatant rip-off of water.  The Pixies were great, don't get me wrong, but just because they came first and were less popular doesn't mean they're better.  If older automatically means better, we all better start worshipping the caveman who started bashing two rocks together to make noise.I'm sorry that the Pixies guy below me feels so threatened by Nirvana's music that he has to discredit everything they accomplished.  Kurt Cobain did more with three chords than anyone ever will, but it was the feeling he put into his songs that made them powerful.I miss watching Nirvana tear into a song like wolves into meat, hearing Kurt scream like he was being beaten, feeling the intense sensation of knowing that I'm not the only person in the world who feels these ways sometimes.Kurt Cobain caught wind of a good idea and turned it into something more powerful than we have ever heard, and every indie music fan wants to crucify him for it?  That's horses**t, it was cool to listen to Bleach in art class but once it reaches a certain amount of people it loses credibility?  What a confining way to live...I pity you.If you are considering purchasing Nevermind, ask yourself if you like powerful music, something that is going to make you feel and think, something that will trigger something inside you (and it's different for everybody).And maybe check out Mother Love Bone too.P.S. Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament WANTED to be rock stars and then decided they didn't like it after Ten came out, so don't buy into the \"Pearl Jam hated stardom from the beginning\" stuff.\n", "val": 0.00012093134864699095}

I hate it when people call that absolutely talentless @ss known as Kurt Cobain a brilliant songwriter.  Kurt Cobain a brilliant songwriter?  Is that when he's on cocain or heroin?  In the drug crazed world of the Seattle grunge scene, everybody was too stoned to realize that Kurt Cobain was nothing more than a dirty looking, no talent low life--out of his mind on drugs--who wrote inane lyrics while strumming the same 3 chords on his guitar.\"Wow duuuuuuudes!  Kurt Cobain is a lyrical genius!  I can't understand anything he sings, so that must mean he's saying something profound.  Duh!\"Most blatently hypocritical of all is the fact that this whiney, noisemaking nitwit became a filthy rich, multi millionaire, even as he moaned and groaned about the evils of \"selling out\".  Nirvana fans, tell me this.  If Kurt Cobain really was so underground and hardcore, than why did he make so many videos for MTV?  Why did he perform live on MTV and Saturday Night Live?  Why did he have absolutely no talent?  Why did he sign a multi million dollar, major label record deal?  No answers to these and many other questions?  The answer is simple, Nirvana were not a real band.  They were just a corporate creation assembled in board rooms by fat, balding, cigar smoking buiseness men in suits and ties.  They were just an 80s version of the Backstreet Boys, designed to exploit a fad and separate a bunch of impressionable suburban teenagers from their money.Nirvana had no talent what-so-ever.  Anybody can string 3 or 4 distorted power chords togeather and add a bunch of brainless lyrics over them.  It doesn't take a brilliant songwriter to come up with \"sell the Kids for food/Weather changes moods.\"  Nirvana was just a blatent marketing scam.I have to admit, I once liked the corporate rock sellout band known as Nirvana, back when I was just a kid.  After all, I was 9 in 1994, when Kurt Cobain comitted suicide, in a futile attempt to compensate for his awesome lack of talent.

{"text": "Normally I don't write reviews on music this old, but I felt compelled to based on its high level of appreciation and talent.Nirvana came around just as I had finished high school, a few months after I believe, and as I was entering college. Their new single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was like an anthem on my college campus, everyone knew about it and played over and over again. I knew about new bands back then like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, but Nirvana seemed to have crushed them all with its fist, dominating radio waves as well as the music scene on campus.The first song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", a four-chord rocker, was something I immediately liked as soon as I first heard it. I would go on to eventually buy the album and then be stunned to find songs on here at the same level of intensity and creativity as their famous song. (I would eventually get a lap dance to \"In Bloom\" and make out to \"Lithium\")Their other songs elevated to anthem status, with every song capturing its own spotlight based on what it was like. \"In Bloom\" was a very intense song, with incredible guitar work and crisp drumming. \"Come as You Are\" I found was a very gothic sounding piece, and I made me think of depressing times in my life. Yet, the song eventually caught on and became a work of art.\"Breed\" is a very heavy song, and so is \"Territorial Pissings\", which not very many people like, but I do. These songs start off intense and end intense, they have no soft spots between them. Yet, there are soft songs on this album, \"Polly\" and the very awkward yet eerily soothing \"Something In the Way\". Each of these songs is a solo by Kurt and his guitar.The other songs became masterpieces in their own right, \"On A Plain\" was very interesting to me and every time I put it on, it still confuses me a bit. I don't know why, it's just mystifying.In the end, the album was rather remarkable. It changed the way rock was visualized and perceived. I thought of rock back in '91 as nothing but crazy guitar done by people in comical long hair and disturbing make-up. I was not a fan of this wacko music. Nirvana was different, they saw something different than what the mainstream saw it as, and changed it with this album. In the post-Nirvana age, people create music but you can tell some of them try to cop Nirvana's depressing yet angry style of play.I know that this album is so old and not really listened to that much anymore, but if anyone wants to hear classic grunge at its finest, I suggest you pick up this album.

{"text": "I am shocked at the amount of people claiming that Nirvana had no talent.  That such bands as Alice In Chains and Sound Garden deserve much more praise becuase of their musical technical abilities.  First off, those bands are 4 piece bands, meaning, if Nirvana had decided to get some awesome electric guitar player, they'd now be considered, by you, as talented.  This is a ridiculous and ignorant way to justify talent.  Talent is creativity, it is dwelling deep within your being and expressing that outward, as Kurt and Nirvana did.  This isn't some contest to determine who can play in the key of bm as cleanly and fast as possible, music is about originality, finding your own inner talent and expressing that as best you can.  They were a band of experimination, the sounds they were creating were almost completely new, this is creativity vs. something like practice and formulaic learning.  Anyways, since when was music supposed to be about talent?  Music is about captivating the listener, moving a person beyond the level of logic, speaking to their very soul.  If music doesn't do this to you, my suggestion to you is to open your ears, stop thinking so much and just listen to the sounds as they are, it's a beautiful thing.\n", "val": 0.02264063060283661}

Not necessarily a great one, but hearing Smells Like Teen Spirit get radio play in the early nineties was at least a little refreshing. Still, I don't think MTV was the right place for Nirvana. Had they stayed underground they no doubt would have been recognized as one of the greatest indie rock bands of all time and at least have been able to retain some respect. Anyway, Smells Like Teen Spirit is, in my opinion, the greatest song of generation X, and it is also my opinion that Cobain's writing it was somewhat a fluke, as no other song by them even holds a candle to it.

The intense praise this band gets is downright sickening.How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana \"saved rock n roll\"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!  It felt good to listen to!  Life was good!  But then in 1992 along came Nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music, and rock was never really the same again.  Everybody was miserable.  Nobody had any fun any more.  If a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time, then that band was \"cheesy\" and \"stuck in the 80s\".  Stuck in the 80s???  Well, if making music for entertainment purposes only, and not using it as an outlet to whine about your personal problems is an \"80s\" thing to do, then the 80s is where I want to stay!Grunge makes you feel like killing yourself.  In the 90s I used to like grunge, and I went through a period of severe depression.  But in '99 I took all my Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains CDs and I burned them!  And then I spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock bands!  And my depression instantly disappeared!  I was finally happy for the first time in 3 years, and I owe it all to ditching my grunge CDs.I don't recommend Nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody.  Grunge is the most depressing music in the world, and basically just encourages you to hang yourself.  It causes depression and suicide!  Don't poison your mind with this morbid garbage!  Stay away from grunge!\n", "val": 0.00011161849397467449}

In the autumn of 1991, the cathartic wails and ramshackle guitar work of Kurt Cobain, the thundering bass of Krist Novoselic, and the abuse of the drums by David Grohl exploded onto American radio in the form of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Many people had never heard anything as astonishing as that single, but it didn't stop there.Subsequent hit \"In Bloom\" featured perhaps the messiest, most lurching guitar solo ever committed to tape. \"Come As You Are\" and \"Lithium\" were ballads, but unlike any to ever hit the mainstream. \"Breed\" and \"Territorial Pissings\" were raw blasts of punk-rock. \"Polly\" and \"Something In The Way\" were spare acoustic songs. \"Drain You\" even made a detour into psychedelia.It is a testament to how great Nirvana was that they were able to cover so much ground on one record and execute it with perfection.

If kurt hated fame so much, then why did to sign to a major record label?2. This Band is as manufactured and preposterous as backstreet boys pop.3.

I have heard dozens of 80s/90s hair metal bands, but NONE of them even come close to being as phenominally bad as Nirvana.  Nirvana was so HORRIBLE!  I can still remember that awful day back in 1992 when I was first exposed to the abomination known as Nirvana.  I tuned in to my local contempory radio station, and then I heard that horrible filth entitled \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" coming out of the speakers.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing!  I mean I had put up with noise pollution before (heavy traffic, construction zones, etc), but this was just too much to bear!  At this point, I didn't know what this crap was called until I saw the equally horrible video.  I could feel my blood pressure skyrocketing at the sight of that garbage.Its been a long time since I first heard the world's worst band, but I have still NEVER, EVER heard ANY band even remotely as bad as Nirvana.  That teen pop boom in the late 90s looks like the most brilliant music ever recorded compared to all those awful grunge bands of the 80s and early 90s.  Even New Kids on the Block, MC Hammer, and Vanilla Ice look brilliant compared to Nirvana.  Now, I'm not sure how much of a compliment that is, since even a rusty chainsaw going at full speed sounds better than Nirvana, but I am quite sure that Nirvana were the most talentless hacks that ever lived.

Kurt Cobain a brilliant songwriter?  Is that when he's on cocain or heroin?  In the drug crazed world of the Seattle grunge scene, everybody was too high to see Kurt Cobain for what he was--an unbathed, greasy, dirty looking lowlife--out of his mind on drugs--who wrote incoherent lyrics about how miserable life is.\"With the lights out its less dangerousHere we are now entertain usI feel stupid and contagiousHere we are now entertain us\"Is that what you call \"brilliant songwriting\"?  It doesn't sound very brilliant to me.  All it sounds like to me is the angry, incoherent ranting of an unstable dopehead.  Kurt Cobain's lyrics are meaningless.  Just a bunch of incoherant rants that he scribbled in his diary after sticking filthy needles in his arm.Don't buy into the hype about this album.  No matter how many \"Rolling Stone\" articles praise it as the \"Best Album of the 90s\", don't pay any attention.

{"text": "There isn't all that much new that you can say about Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" that hasn't already been said. So this review is more like a review/essay.The hype and mystique surrounding this album is all true. It did change the face of rock, and along with Pearl Jam's \"Ten\" was the songbook that most popular 90s bands borrowed from.So much has been written about Kurt Cobain, his life, his suicide, Courtney, Courtney/Grohl feud, etc., that's it's easy to forget what all started the hype in the first place. Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" is undoubtedly one of the greatest rock albums of-all-time. From the classic intro of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" to the subdued closing \"Something In the Way,\" every song is both instantly memorable and brilliant. There isn't a single bad song on this disc. \"Nevermind\" is like a greatest hits in of itself.What made this album so great was that the music was punk, but also had a pop-sensibility with infectious hooks and killer riffs. In this sense, you kind of get the best of both worlds--the raw anger and energy of Black Flag, and The Dead Kennedy's, but also the melody and harmony of The Beatles.If you were born shortly before or after the death of Kurt Cobain, it's hard to imagine how revolutionary this CD was. When \"Nevermind\" exploded, it drew the line in rock. Bands that were otherwise obscure (Mudhoney, L7, Screaming Trees) were signed to major labels and enjoyed radio-play. Alternative bands that had been around for a few years that were already signed (Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Alice In Chains) became huge overnight. The early 90s was a really exciting time in rock. Radio had been infested with the likes of Slaughter and Trixter, and, for a while, everything was new and fresh.The only real drawback for me is that the revolution of \"Nevermind\" made people close minded about bands they had only just recently loved. Although it is a blessing that some of these bands were shown the door, i.e., Slaughter, a lot of good bands were discarded and trashed rightfully or not. \"Nevermind\" was certainly the death nail to all old-school rock. Most of these bands were killed overnight.In conclusion, fourteen years after its release, \"Nevermind\" often emulated, never duplicated, is still one of the best albums of all-time and belongs in every rock collection.\n", "val": 0.04630152881145477}

Nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things.  Nirvana were not about music.  They were about conformity, and nothing more.  Just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a fad, and separate a bunch of naive, whiney, immature, suburban teenagers from their money.  They were the Backstreet Boys with guitars.  The Linkin Park of 1988-1994.  I hold Nirvana fully responsible for everything bad that has happened to popular music in the 90s and the 21st century.

It is painfully obvious to anyone with ears that Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" is a total and complete rip-off of Warrant's \"Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich.\" The riff from \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was stolen from \"Down Boys.\" \"Lithium\" is basically the same song as \"Sometimes She Cries,\" but with different pretentious lyrics. \"In Bloom\" is also a rip-off of \"32 Pennies.\" The list goes on and on. Almost song for song, Nirvana's \"Masterpiece\" is a total Warrant rip-off.Kurt Cobain stole Jani Lane's persona/idenity. Kurt Cobain used to have dirty blond hair, but he dyed it blond so he could look like Jani. Cobain even tried (and failed) to imitate Jani Lane's signature vocals. All of Cobain's solos are a poor imitation of Joey Allen.The truth of the matter is, in 1988, Sub Pop tried to sign Warrant, but Warrant refused and opted for Columbia. A few years later, Sub Pop signed Nirvana, under the condition that they remake \"Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich\" under a new title. The cloths may have been different, but the music was straight out of Warrant's song book.Nirvana DID not define or represent generation x, Warrant did!!!

{"text": "Alright, folks, here it is.  THE album of the nineties, and the album that defined a generation.  Since the end of the Vietnam War, popular music had been stagnating.  There were great underground movements, such as punk and industrial, but music on the whole became more and more about posturing and posing.  As became painfully obvious with the hair-metal of the eighties, rock had lost all of its urgency.  It wasn't about saying something that needed to be said, but rather about pushing product.  The record companies were consolidating, using the power that afforded them to create rubrics for musical acts to fit into.  And it worked, because the only reason people made music was for fame and fortune.That's why the mad scramble of the record companies in the beginning of the nineties is so funny.  Nirvana hit with Nevermind, and all the sudden it wasn't cool to be corporate or prepackaged.  The scramble of the record companies allowed for such bands as Live, Alice In Chains, Weezer, and many more to have mega hits.  All of a sudden, music listeners were being offered quality music that came from the heart with the kind of quality that big studio bucks and major label backing could afford.  Before this album, we never would have heard Lightning Crashes, or Buddy Holly, or Rooster.But Nirvana weren't stars, and never wanted to be.  They just put out music.  Despite how well this album sold and how popular they were, they didn't want the limelight.  In the end, it killed Kurt Cobain.  So don't write reviews like you've got some sort of grudge against them for being so popular.  If Kurt Cobain can't play guitar as well as Robert Fripp, who cares?  He wrote music to supplement the song - not the other way around.  This isn't prog-rock; it's just rock and roll, and the reason it's so successful is that every second of music, especially on this album and In Utero, is infused with the emotion that Kurt put in to the song.  It's not about being popular, and it's certainly not about appeasing your jealousy or whatever it is that inspires your grudge.

But the rest of the album is, quite simply, lifeless. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is one of the mediocrities that dominated rock radio in the early 90's.You hardcore Nirvana fans need to understand something: Kurt Cobain was not a good guitarist.

I often read negative reviews of items that I love, and I become angry enough to review the item myself, just to add more positive reviews to Amazon. Nevermind is one of those albums that get a lot of positive and negative reviews, and every time I see a one star review, I want to shoot that reviewer! Then I read that reviewer's other reviews and find out that they like bands that I absolutely HATE like Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, Korn, Guns N' Roses etc. (I think all of those bands are a bunch of posers!) Whenever that happens, I feel so angry that I want to post some kind of protest review!Many people think that this album is overrated I definitely don't think so! It may even be underrated considering all of the negative one star reviews out there! Anyway, my reviews of each song are:1. Smells Like Teen Spirit 11/10My favorite song of all time!! (I know, call me a poser because Kurt didn't think this song was so great or whatever, I still think it's great) It is a great way to open the album, or any album for that matter!! There is such energy to that song that is so unexplainable!! When I was first getting into Nirvana (about 5 years ago) I would listen to that song, then listen to it again because the song is so amazing!! This was the song that made Nirvana famous, and I am glad it did! Many people may think the song is overplayed then give it a bad review, but how often it is played does not effect how good a song is at all!! The best song of all time could be on repeat for 100 years and end up breaking the speaker! That does not change how good a song is. You may get tired of it, and if you do turn it off and don't listen to it for a while. After a while, you can turn the song on again, and get into it all over again. It is a great song!! The video is great too.2. In Bloom 9.5/10Also a great song! It is a really good song to hear right after the previous song! It is really catchy and was one of the first nirvana songs that I got into. The video for it was really cool! They were supposed to look like The Beatles on Ed Sullivan (Because that was when The Beatles were getting really big too! Obviously the Nirvana didn't get as popular as The Beatles did but it was still sending a similar message. The Beatles are also one of my favorites too!) In Bloom is a ridiculous song.3. Come As You Are 10/10Another classic by Nirvana! This song was the second biggest hit off \"Nevermind\" (Lithium might be played more though, I'm not sure) the melody of this song is totally brilliant! I Love it!!4. Breed 9.5/10I think this song is underrated. I love how this song rocks really hard! The lyrics are rad, and the song is very catchy. I also love how you can hear the guitar panning between speakers during the guitar solo. Absolute Brilliance to the ear!5. Lithium 10/10This is my second favorite song by Nirvana, and is the very first Nirvana song I heard. The song is brilliant, there isn't a whole lot I could say about this song that hasn't been said countless times before. (Unlike Teen Spirit, where I have a somewhat different opinion on.)6. Polly 9/10This is probably my least favorite on here, but it is still brilliant none the less. The worst song here is still a 9/10, which is better than a lot of band's best song! It has some very dark lyrics, and has a cool chorus. It is brilliant.7. Territorial Pissings 10/10I think this is the most underrated song on this album, and I think it is brilliant! (\"Brilliant\" is a very used word for this album, because that word describes the album so well!) There is such a special energy about this song that is ridiculous! I really like how different this song is. It is a perfect song to play when you are pissed off at something!8. Drain You 9/10Brilliant! I love the sound effects during the middle section of the song! I also love the furious four chords that you hear right after the rad build up!9. Lounge Act 9/10It is brilliant! I love the cool Bassline. Nothing much else for me to say other then saying \"Brilliant\" another five times!10. Stay Away 9.5/10I LOVE this song!! It is also a very good song to listen to when you are pissed off!! The drums are awesome! The bassline is also really cool!! Brilliant!!!11. On A Plain 9.5/10This song is also brilliant! (As are every song on here!!) The lyrics are very haunting, resulting chills down your spine! There aren't enough positive comments that I can say about this album!12. Something In The Way 10/10This song is Brilliant! (I know that I've said Brilliant on every song on here! The album is just too brilliant!!) This song isn't really about Kurt living under a bridge (even though many people believe that. I can understand, because I believed it too for a while until recently) the song is about the alienation from the rest of the world as if Kurt was homeless living under a bridge. The atmosphere in this song is soo cool! I think this song is a great way to end such a remarkable album! Normally I would think that a song that really rocks is the best way to end an album, but not in this case. The dark chilling mellow atmosphere is magnificently captured in this song. The chello sound rules! The song is very moving!12. Endless, Nameless 7/10This is the hidden song on Nevermind. It is mainly just a bunch of noise and feedback with Kurt screaming random things. It is about 6:40 long. I think it is a cool addition to the album; I don't listen to it as much as all of the other songs on this album but whatever.This concludes my review of Nirvana's \"Nevermind\". It is a great classic that has been very influential. One of my complaints about other reviews I have read is people complaining about Kurt Cobain not being such a great guitar player. Nirvana is not the kind of band that has a million 20 minute guitar solos in every song. That wasn't what this band was about. They were about making good music, not impressing everybody with the fast solos. The guitar solos that Nirvana did have were more about serving, and making the song better. Not about how many complicated licks we can pull off. I'm not criticizing the bands that do have really impressive solos. I'm just saying that wasn't the point of Nirvana. Dave Grohl is an insane drummer by the way. Another complaint I have is other reviewers saying that Nirvana was the reason that all of the bad punk music of today exists. I totally disagree. The music before Nirvana and the grunge movement are bands like Motley Crue and Poisen. Those bands were not about the integrity of the music and songwriting; they were concerned about how many girls they get. And people don't really know of what music would be out today if Nirvana didn't exist. If anyone can somehow go in a time machine and somehow make Nirvana not exist and show me the music of today if it is better, maybe I will believe them. But that is never going to happen. Nirvana did not destroy rock, they improved it dramatically. We could still have the bad hair bands of the 80's but instead, we got Brilliant art like this album.\"Nevermind\" is my favorite album of all time, and will probably be my favorite for a long time. If you agree with anything I said in this review, you will probably realize the brilliance of this album! \"Nevermind\"\n", "val": 0.010176247917115688}

You can blame Nirvana for all those annoying \"mallcore\" bands like Korn, Nickelback, and Linkin Park who have dominated the rock charts since the 1990s.  Almost everything bad about today's music started with Nirvana--monotone vocals that explode into raging screams, walls of distorted guitar noise, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is.Do you Nirvana fans really believe all the hype about Nirvana \"killing off hair metal\" and \"saving rock n roll\"?  Nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things.  Nirvana were not about music.  They were about conformity and nothing more.  Just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable, immature, whiney suburban teenagers from their money.

Yes, this is what got MTV's greedy corporate ass to pay attention to indie rock and alternative rock (at least from '91 to '94), and yes, Kurt Cobain was very honorable with his down-to-earth look at celebrity life, as well as his open-mindedness.But is this record a classic? No way. It's a landmark, but not a classic. This may have been the cream of the crop 13 years ago, but trying to pass it off as legendary nowadays is ridiculous. Because so many bands have tried to cop this one's style (specifically trash like Nickelback and Staind), it's almost impossible to hear with fresh ears. Not to mention the slick, big league production is hardly the way Nirvana was supposed to sound; listen to either \"Bleach\" or \"In Utero\". The raw, stark, dirty, not-so-radio-friendly sound of both albums fits their style of music much better.That being said, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is probably one of the only songs that still sounds vital and hard rockin' by todays standards.

Whoever unlocked a studio door and handed a recording contract to these talentless @sses should be held accountable for the nu metal fad most rock radio listeners had to endure as the 1990s came to a close. Nirvana were nothing more than a record company's marketing ploy.  Just like Linkin Park is to the 21st century, Nirvana were to the 90s.  This was the original corporate mallcore band, tailor made by a record company to exploit and take advantage of the public's stupidity.  Just like Korn or Linkin Park today, Nirvana pandered to a bunch of snobby suburban rich kids, who thought their life was miserable just because their parents wouldn't drive them to the mall.  By 1992, just about every member of GenerationXhad been brainwashed into thinking they were \"angst ridden\" and that Nirvana \"Understood their pain\" and could \"realte\" to them.WHO DID THESE PEOPLE THINK THEY WERE FOOLING!?Nirvana were the Backstreet Boys of rock!  Their \"angst ridden\" image was contrived and manufactured.  Kurt was not an artist, but a shrewd businessman, who manufactured angst and anger, then watered it down for mass consumption!  Make no mistake about it, Kurt and his record company knew EXACTLY what their fans wanted to hear, and they pandered to them with watered down, whiney lyrics about how awful life is.  And all the brainwashed Nirvana fans followed like a brainwashed cult.  Nirvana--the Backstreet Boys of rock!\n", "val": 8.331282151630148e-05}

They just popped up at the right time, when rock had gotten stale and boring (remember the Sex Pistols and the Clash in '77?)and surprisingly it caught on big time. But most people made more out of it than it really was and even Kurt agreed. He hated this album and said so many times. It wasn't punk, it wasn't grunge (which is basically a term used by people who didn't want to call \"their\" music alternative), it was alternative, plain and simple. There is one punk song on this record, Territorial Pissings, the rest are hard rock, or alternative. The fact that people took this drug addicted sociopath and made him an icon shows just how bland things were back then. I had to do drugs just to forget this era, it sucked and so did most of this music.

{"text": "Folks can quote Schopenhauer & say Kurt was ignorant or, OTOH, call him the early '90s rock messiah but the plain truth is . . . they're both wrong. Nirvana needs to be understood in the context of the Seattle music scene of the time. The best way to get a handle on that is to watch the documentary Hype! & realize that the Seattle scene was an excellerated microcosm of the rest of the country. Because of that, its bands evolved in a way that was unlike any other major city's scene in the US or UK. Collectively, those bands - Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Screaming Trees, The Posies, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, etc (&, yes, even Tad!) - affected the the direction of popular music so dramatically that it practically changed overnight. I remember vividly the first time I heard Nirvana's Sliver on a local college radio station driving home from work one Los Angeles evening in 1981. It was so vastly different from  everything else being played at the time that I 'bout had to pull off the freeway! But that uniqueness was not owned by Nirvana. Kurt, like the rest of the artists from the Seattle scene, never wanted big fame or to be rock & roll heroes; they just wanted to play their music on their terms. By the time the rest of the world discovered what was happening there, the scene was already changing. (Read what Michael Stipe has to say about the direction Kurt's music was going at the time of his death.)By the time it hit the mainstream, Grunge was already dead. Those who say it was about any one specific band weren't paying attention. It was about the scene itself. And once it got out to the masses - who almost universally misunderstood it - and the sound was appropriated by bands like Stone Temple Pilots, the originators lost interest. Notice how the sounds of bands like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, & The Posies had radically changed by 1994 & their peers had dropped off the charts. Same thing happened in the early '80s with REM, U2, The Clash, etc. Same thing happened with the Beatles & the Beach Boys.It's so easy to write a hagiographic piece about a guy who was the antithesis of the New Kids on the Block & easier to vilify him. But the truth of the matter is, most folks tend to view Nirvana in 20/20 rose-colored hindsight. Remember folks, the Beatles' stuff can sound trite in light of their imitators, too. But let's be honest & remember who did what first. And admit that it was never really about Nirvana & Nirvana alone. Just as it was for the '70s punk bands, it was about all the bands of the Seattle scene, their music, & the opportunity to play it. And when I hear a band like Nickel Creek drop part of Lithium into the middle of one of their bluegrass numbers - & rock the varnish offa their instruments! - I know that the Seattle ethic is alive & well in the musicians of today who were influenced by Kurt 15 years ago.\"Rock is dead.

If his music was good or bad. That doesn't matter. \"Nevermind\" is a normally weak and simple album. With some strange lyrics that he wrote while being on drugs and some ridiculous \"anti-social\" lyrics about teenagers (\"Smell like teens Spirit\") and about fashion (\"In Bloom\"). All this, accompanied with his appearance that made him a good media character, the musical theory stolen form Soundgarden and helped by the lack of interest that people had in the stupidity of the hair bands, made people think \"he's expressing his feelings\", and here you have it. \"Nevermind\". The most overrated album in the history of the art known as music.But all that doesn't matter. What matters is the wave of fifth class contemporary pseudo nihilism that his death created.

It is incredible that Cobain, with a bad guitar work, simple catchy tunes, bad voice and acting like buffoon, was able to change, in a negative form, the idiosyncracy of so many people. Shame on the human being that leaves an ant affect his/her life and/or his/her virtue and/or his/her faith and/or his/her reason. The predictably disguising garbage that emanates from the mouths of Cobain's biggest fans has no chance of becoming relevant ideas. Forget about the fact that if he wouldn't ve been a good looking man, he wouldn't be 1/10 of what he is today. Forget about the fact that Grunge was a fashion for the weak minds. Forget about that. Just keep in mind that the morons keep the teenybooper inside and that's why Cobain is still a hero.Nihilist? If you are retarded, then yes, Cobain was a Nihilist. Not the kind of Nihilist whose non-rational philosophy of Will takes him/her to levels of self esteem. No, not that kind of Nihilist. Cobain was the type of Nihilist that dressed differently and acted differently.

{"text": "I say this because it's true. Nirvana had it's first album,Bleach,which had a bundle of incredible songs,but lacked radioplay and a good single. So,when recording their second album,the tried hard to create a better product for the fans. Thus,we have Nevermind,Nirvana's masterpiece.From the opening \"Smell's Like Teen Spirit\" to it's finish \"Something in The Way\",it is full of punk riffs and melodius vocals and incredible and sometimes haunting lyrics. You have probably heard the single track \"Smell's Like Teen Spirit\",since it is the song that started a revolution,but that is definetly the only great highlight. After that,brings in the track \"In Bloom\" which has a catchy bass line and a memorable chorus. Following that is one of many people's all time favorite's \"Come As You Are\",another song with an incredible bass line,but it's lyrics are some of the best written in that era.\"Breed\" is almost a blast of punk energy rising out of the previous track,with Kurt's vocals making want you to sing along.\"Lithium\" is a good song,but can be considered a little dull by some.\"Polly\"is performed acousitcally,but with Kurt's low pitched singing,and it's disturbing lyrics,it's one of the haunting moments on Nevermind,but it is still an excellent song. It is followed by the odd thrack \"Territorial Pissings\" which has Cobain screaming most of the track behind swift guitar and pounding drums.\"Drain You\" may sound creepy,but it really has in incredible melody with a firm chorus structre,and with the grotesque lyrics and the melody break two minutes in with Cobain echoing the word you...,it adds incredible intrest to the album.\"Lounge Act\" is one of my personal favorites because i'm a fan of punk,and this is a relative sound to many of the punk acts of the past.\"Stay Away\" is a defining moment,with Cobain's ferocious groaning and shifting guitar,makes it one of the most intresting tracks.\"On A Plain\" and \"Something In The Way\" will forever be remembered by there appearance on their later Unplugged performance,but both well stand the test of time by the modern rock standards they helped set.\"Something In The Way\" particualrly stands out as the slowest track,but probably as the most introspective,leaving it as the finishing point for a genre defining album.Nevermind is one of the few albums that can satisfy almost any rock fans intrest,because of it's constantly shifting melodies and changes in atmosphere. My father,a fan of band's like Metallica and Black Sabbath and many other Metal acts of the decade,loves every track on the album. If you do not already own it,you should buy it immeaditely.

When I first listened to Nevermind Kurt Kobain's voice sounded good but now, ten years later it sounds like  a dying animal.  I'm still a 90's rock fan (Alice in Chains, Candlebox, Stp, Tool) but Nirvana simply did not age like a fine wine like these other bands did.

Nothing sounded better at the time.  These loud angry songs that just allowed you space to just loose it.  All the songs are great and all have something to give. Time has not diminished the power of this album.  Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, and Lithium only scratch the surface of what you will hear.  Lounge Act, Drain You, Stay Away, and Breed are amazing powerful songs.  And Something In The Way, a nice, quiet and beautiful song.  An interesting way to end an album that brought anger and passion back into rock.  Rarely does an album come out that changes everything so completely.  This is one to those rare albums that did it.

{"text": "The person who wrote that bad review about Kurt Cobain is a clown with a capital C. That is why his name is Corcky. By the way, I read your other reviews. As much as I like Pearl Jam Binaural is not a five star album. Also I would take Nirvana over Pearl Jam anyday. Pearl Jam haven't exactly made ground breaking albums since 1994. I think If Kurt Cobain was alive he would have made many more incredible albums. I would take Nevermind and In Utero anyday over any Pearl Jam albums. Again I am a huge Pearl Jam fan, but I think Nirvana was much better when they were around. I am bored of all Nirvana albums because I have listened to them so many times since 1995. But, for a new music fan these albums are essential for the 90's. When I first listened to these albums I was blown away. I can't really say that about many other albums. Artists today can take a lesson or two from a band like Nirvana. They were original and that is what made them so great. Love them or hate them their is no denying the talent of a lead singer like Kurt Cobain. I feel bad for the kids today cause most of the music sucks. I do like bands like Linkin Park, but most bands today don't have the emotion and heart like a band like Nirvana. I really feel Kurt Cobain was like our Lennon of the 90's. I also love the Beatles too. Kurt Cobain never got the chance to put out a huge body of work to prove himself. Check out a band called Bright Eyes. I saw them in concert a few days ago. I can't believe how much heart and talent this 24 year old lead singer has(Conor Oberst). At the end of the show he smashed his equipment. He also sang an anti-Bush song with so much passion I thought it was the early 90's. My friends think it's sad, but I like bands like Good Charlotte and New Found Glory, but they truly lack that rock star passion. If you disagree with me you simply  weren't old enough in the early 90's to experience the music. Like I said go to a Bright Eyes concert and you will see pure talent, heart, and passion. Something that most bands today don't display.\n", "val": 0.0011308181565254927}
{"text": "What's there to say about \"Nevermind\"? It's the landmark album of the 90's; the album that changed music; etc. You know the drill.Indeed, \"Nevermind\" is a stellar album. The best of the 90's? Not in my opinion. Most important? Yes. Overrated? No. Overplayed? Oh yeah. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", \"Lithium\", \"Come As You Are\", and \"In Bloom\" are all 90's rock anthems that still get heavy rotation today.Even after you've heard 'em 100 times, you can still appreciate that they're incredibly well written songs. Butch Vig's production is very polished (which some people resent), giving nearly every song a radio-friendly sheen (as opposed to the lo-fi \"Bleach\"). Even \"Breed\" is so damn catchy that it overshadows how heavy it is..Other great songs that aren't played as much (if at all) include the accoustic \"Polly\", the artsier rock of \"Drain You\", the intense \"Territorial Pissings\" (which sounds like a precursor to their abrasive, anti-produced follow-up \"In Utero\"), the melodic pop of \"On a Plain\", the smooth-yet-jagged \"Lounge Act\", and the eerie closer \"Something In the Way\".So yes, it's overplayed. Yes, it's not the most groundbreaking album (the soft/loud formula was done by The Pixies years before). But Kurt Cobain could write a the most rocking, coolest pop songs..and you gotta give him credit for that.If there's a downside to \"Nevermind\", it's that it influenced a lot of sub-par copycats who dominate the airwaves today. Still, it's an essential album.Best Songs: Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Lithium, Drain You, Something In the Way, Lounge Act.\n", "val": 0.04458911716938019}

{"text": "God, Nirvana have to be the most overrated band in existence. People obsess over Nirvana, but stop yourselves and think, aside from alright songwriting skills, what talent did Kurt Cobain really have? he couldn't play guitar, my friend has played guitar for 6 months and can play almost every Nirvana song flawlessly. The riffs are simple and extremely repetitive, along with most of his lyrics, and he sounds like a dying camel when he sings. As for the other members- Dave Grohl is not a terrible drummer, but hes not great either, hes average at best. As for Novoselic, his bass lines are inaudible until Kurt starts whacking his guitar and screaming, and the song settles down again when hes done.The only reason Nirvana was revolutionary was because they were different. Metal and pop dominated the Tv and radio, which Kurt, unlike anybody else at the time, actively disliked. So, he formed a talentless band and practically revolutionized, if not created, grunge. The only reason so many people like Nirvana is because they haven't heard of any of the other Seattle grunge bands, almost all of which are more talented than Nirvana. So Nirvana comes along, and all of a sudden it sucks to be a teenager and we need to throw away our hairspray and spandex and wear crappy flannel shirts and be depressed.In my opinion, Kurt killed himself because he soon realized what he had done. After Nirvana started a revolution in crappy music, hundreds of other bands were able to get record deals because they knew thats what the public wanted now, hence the birth of Green Day and pop punk. Green Day released Dookie, and soon hundreds of kids got interested in \"punk\" because they believed that was what punk was- catchy hooks and simple guitar riffs. Once Green Day got going, music was never the same again. The only metal still alive is classic metal bands making comebacks (Megadeth, Iron Maiden) and new underground VERY talented foreign metal bands (Children of Bodom, In Flames). I believe if Kurt was still alive, even he would be crying because of what he had done to music. no longer do we have fun metal around, we have rap and terrible pop. thanks Nirvana. thanks alot.If you're debating whether to get this album, dont. by doing this you support a talentless revolution and instead of rebelling against todays music, you are simply buying right into what started it. Its a sad world in music right now, but at least we can live off the underground bands.As for the album itself: Smells Like Teen Spirit is the only alright song, as it has an infectius guitar riff, but Kurts crappy vocals muddle it. the rest of the songs have crappy simple and repetitive guitar riffs and sound like complete sh*t. not worth a dollar, but i was dumb enough to buy it.\n", "val": 0.00015328075096476823}

This album introduced Smells Like Teen Spirit, the best rock song EVER.1. Smells like Teen Spirit: Need I say more? 10/102. In Bloom: A powerful, heavy track that follows up well to the first track. 9/103. Come as You Are: Another hit, the famous bass line at the beginning is unforgettable. 9/104. Breed: A shame it wasn't on the greatest hits album, but the verses are nothing compared to the chorus. 8/105. Lithium: Brilliant song which builds up to the heavier climax. 9/106. Polly: Depressing but brilliant song, depicting the real life kidnapping of Polly Klass, who gained the attacker's trust and escaped him. 9/107. Territorial Pissing: This is one helluva crazy song, Kurt Cobain's voice breaks at the end as he screams his head off. 8/108. Drain You: Good song that goes all freaky in the middle and then goes heavy again. 8/109. Lounge Act: The bass line, like Come As You Are, is good but it gets boring after a while. 7/1010. Stay Away: The worst song on the album, it really lacks compared to some of the other tracks. 6/1011. On A Plain: A great song which gives the album a bit of a kick after the bad previous tracks. 8/1012. Something in the Way: Quiet, miserable, boring song that waits about 20 minutes before it turns into a secret track which is also kind of rubbish. 4/10The songs are excellent up to Lounge Act.

They all talk about how \"influential\" Nirvana was and how Kurt was \"brilliant\" and a \"tortured genius\".

But if Nirvana really was so big in the 80s, then why didn't I ever hear of them until 1996?  I clearly remember the first time I ever heard of Nirvana.  It was late 96, almost 3 years after Kurt ate a shotgun barrel.  Everybody was talking about how they were supposedly \"legendary\".  I had never heard of Nirvana until then, even though I knew all the other 80s bands.It is a well known fact that the only reason Nirvana are famous is because Kurt is dead.  Compare their record sales before he died with the record sales after he died.  It is a shocking difference.  Nevermind has gone 10 times platinum since he died.  You can tell how awful a band is when their record sales skyrocket after the lead singer kills himself.There's no way Nirvana would have been famous if Kurt didn't commit suicide.

{"text": "To say that the first major label debut of this legendary Arberdeen, Washington (their town of origin - only later they moved to Seattle) changed music is only to state the obvious.  It's common knowledge already that the powers to be saw fit to drop the Los Angeles glam metal bands off their rosters due to the then-promising and lucrative Seattle grunge scene that Nirvana helped cast into open light.  Everyone, it seems, says that Kurt Cobain and his group brought an almost non-materialistic, inner-seeking, and spiritualistic consciousness to Generation X (born 1962 - 1979 approx.).  While there is certainly truth to all that, Kurt Cobain, immensely talented and visionary though he was, was a heroine-addled and misanthropist mental defective whose only way out was suicide.  Now to review the actual music itself...'It Smells Like Teen Spirit' is one of the most complex melodic songs ever recorded by an air guitar band, sounding like a heavy metal Beatles song.  The lyrics are jabberwocky for rock but the melody is extremely good.  Good enough for the mainstream and good enough for the metalheads to enjoy (even though they put down metal, Cobain, the main songwriter and singer, was a fan of Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, etc. and his tunes 'Stay Away'  'Lounge Act', and 'Territorial Pissings' sound more heavy metal than the 1990's rock Nirvana helped make possible to exist).  'Something in the Way' is a folkish song at a snail's pace and 'On A Plain' is like an air guitar 60's song, a number that fans of The Clash - an outfit borrowing much from that period - might enjoy.  The instrument playing is not particularly distinctive; it doesn't define Nirvana. But there are exceptions worth mentioning.  Christ Nosevelic's bass is great in the intro to 'Lounge Act' and David Grohl performs top-notch in his solo in 'Stay Away' in the beginning.

Don't get me wrong its a decent CD but the damn thing was overplayed. I personally think the reason why MTV played so much of Nirvana because it was further away from a Rock band in a traditional sense. If you look at the other 3 thier sound was a little more traditional in a sense of pure musicianship. I mean the jump from the Hair metal of the late Eighties to Nirvana was astounding. You can definitely see the change in sound and the look and that is why I think MTV really keyed in on Nirvana. You only had 3 in the group and at the time and thier sound was so Uninhibited with a raw hard kind of punkesque feel which made it kind of unique. I guess I am one of the few who when they saw Nirvana for the first time that their jaw didn't drop to the floor in amazement.

Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic add perfect steaming intensity; a foundation that burns like the fire beneath a cannibal cauldren. Melody is the center of Cobain's songs, no matter if he drones, screams or rages, and Novaselic's baseline is the sweet underpinning that gives this music weight and symmetry.

The silliness of the '80s were wearing out its welcome. Who would have thought that a virtually unknown Seattle band would unseat the (former) king of pop Michael Jackson on the Billboard #200 charts with an album chockful of nihilism, angst, and distorted guitar?As overrated as \"Nevermind\" is, I still think it was a pretty good rock album. The music was a definite contrast from the overindulgence of the hair metal scene . I definitely preferred the band's last studio album \"In Utero\" over \"Nevermind\" but \"Nevermind\" had its charms. I love the bassline for \"Come As You Are\". That is my personal favorite song off \"Nevermind\". I liked the melodies a lot more than \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was and is a good rock song but unfortunately it fell victim to radio overkill. Still I can't deny of the hookiness of the opening guitar riffs. My favorite non-single off the cd is \"Territorial Pissings\". I thought that song really represented Nirvana as a band than \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".As a whole \"Nevermind\" was a good rock album which I cannot deny.As good as \"Nevermind\" is, it definitely wasn't the masterpiece that a lot of people made it out to be. I thought that albums by L7, The Rollins Band, Fugazi, The Gits, 7 Year B***h, Social Distortion, and Babes in Toyland that came out around \"Nevermind\" represented the alternative counter-culture and punk music much better.

{"text": "First of all, Nirvana sucks.  They were totally unoriginal and lame.  They looked lame, they sounded lame and they were total dorks.Rock stars should look cool.  For those of you that don't know what this means, it means you should wear tight leather pants, lots of chains and shiny metal objects, and have tattoos on every exposed surface of your skin.  Did Nirvana have any of this?  No.Rock stars should sound cool.  That means that they should be able to screech long and loud like Axl or Robert Plant.  They should play long and fast guitar solos (like Megadeth), and they should sing about how much money they have and how many chicks they bang.  At the very least, they should be able to brag about how great they are in song.  Did Nirvana do any of these things?  No.Rock stars should be totally original too.  Nirvana's style was basically just cobbled together from bits and pieces of other bands that came before them, unlike true masters of rock like GnR, Megadeth or Metallica.  Plus, their songs were simple and easy to play.  Everyone knows that unless a song contains multiple key changes, minor chord progressions and syncopation, its total crap.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, songs should have lots of guitar solos in them.  Lots of them!So you see, Nirvana was total crap.  They sucked.  They weren't even authentically poor.  They were probably wealthy.  If you listen to Nirvana then you are a total loser.  Go buy something else.  Go buy some Avril or some Good Charlotte.  Better yet, go check out some classics like Van Halen (Sammy Hagar era - I don't think we have to get into that other dork and his pathetic shtik).

Listen to the debut album of the Gits, and when you hear Mia's lonely, introspective voice, you'll understand what it means to be shy and alienated. Nirvana's Nevermind never had the thoughtfulness and self-awareness that Frenching the Bully had. Nevermind also never had any insight or deeper meaning. Kurt Cobain just faked his way into your hearts with his whines and complaints, and y'all fell for it.

{"text": "This is the record that accidentally changed youth culture and rock forever. This wasn't a commercial record... it was never meant to be. Nirvana always did things their own way, and it just so happens that an album meant for the underground ended up multi-platinum. Why? Because stoners and jocks alike realized at the same time that this was very, very good music. Despite that fact, this album as a whole does not define \"grunge\" sound. Grunge is better examplified by Bleach or In Utero, or even Incesticide. Besides the classics (do i need to list them?) there are a few tracks on here with definite 80's sound (There was some concern, before the record was released, that it was too mainstream). Even if you own the Nirvana album, there is still a point to owning this CD. 1. Just to own a piece a history 2. It's still good music 3. You have to know your roots 4. There are some excellent songs on here besides what you hear on local radio, such as Polly, Something in the Way, On a Plain, Breed, and Drain You. What is amazing is not that these songs are incedibly complex, but the originality (of both the music and the lyrics), and most importantly the sheer emotion always present in Kurt Cobain's voice. (Yes i'm aware that he can't, in the classical sense, actually sing) Opinions- The version of Polly present is mediocre, due to overdubbing and cutting off the resonance on the end of lines. You can find a better, more emotional version on the MTV Unplugged album, and a harder version on Incesticide. The version of Something in the Way however,is my favorite, as is Breed. These songs don't get \"old.\" There is no such thing as sounding \"outdated\" besides the changes in recording quality and techniques over the years. Most of these songs were completely different than what was playing at the time. Nirvana has long since been copied, emulated, switched around, chewed up, and spit out as the unoriginal, cliched, soul-less rock on modern radio. But these songs are the originals. The songs that changed music as we know it. Maybe they're not timeless. But they still speak with more volume than anyone thought possible.\n", "val": 0.016636548563838005}

I'm sorry, but Nirvana never could match the cut-and-paste studio job that Butch Vig did for them. Nirvana's Nevermind is just as overproduced as anything from Janet Jackson, Guns & Roses, and Poison. But at least those three bands used the studio gloss to enhance what talent they already had. Nirvana just used that wall of gloss to hide behind and cover up the fact that they couldn't sing or play their instruments. Go buy a super-glossed album from a band that can play and sing.

Nirvana pretty much COMPLETELY changed their sound from Bleach (which was real good) to more steady average structured songs here on Nevermind, money purposes? Hey, maybe. Is it full of angst? Yes. Is it angry? Yes. Is it sludgy? Sort of. Maybe I would like this more if the radio didn't play the hell out of 80% of the tracks (especially one about deodorant) and maybe I'd like it better if the last track didn't suck so much (come on, \"Something in the Way\" is a boring, forgettable track, and radio stations WILL play it to somehow represent that they're cool by playing the last track on a supposedly amazing masterpiece). But the most important thing is, I'd probably like it a hell of a lot more if kids who thought they had a million things on their mind stopped displaying Kurt Cobain as Jesus Christ, he wasn't. Kurt Cobain hated himself folks, he's not the one to idolize. Another reason why I dislike this album is because people view NEVERMIND as the epitome of the Seattle scene, and of course, grunge. It's not even. What about those other guys? Mudhoney? Mother Love Bone? Green River? Screaming Trees? And is it me, or do some Nirvana songs on here sound strikingly familiar to a Green River or Mudhoney track?If you feel the same way as me but don't know much about Nirvana, get this one used, and check out \"Insecticide\" or \"Bleach\".

There have been three documented impressive, impacting and profound cultural music explosions in music history which have influenced our social culture: Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and KURT COBAIN. Kurt Cobain unassumingly took matters beyond Top 40 lovesongs and pop/rock ditties by simply expressing the \"realities\" of the public and private world we live in - his expressive lyrics described modern humanity realistically.

So now most of these songs have been overplayed on the radio, If you haven't heard any of the songs on this album then youve been hiding under a rock for 14 years or your just really young. Nirvana were influential for there time but don't believe that they have influenced average music like we have today. The bad pop punk music today is not because of Nirvana its because of Blink 182, blink 182 was the first pop punk band to become popular. Nirvana never wanted to be a pop band there main influences were led zeppelin and, sex pistols. If you ever heard the sex pistols you would know why kurt liked to scream and use weird singing styles and made them somehow melodic. I don't hear this type of singing on a sum 41 album or a yellowcard album, the crap punk music we have today. The only reason this band became mainstream is because they had to sign with a bigger label in order to live and continue playing,its not easy to be a poor musician.youncanly do it for so long until u have to get a real job. Kurt has said many times he never intended or thought his music would become popular and he really didn't want it to either. There alot of great guitar players that in my opinion have boring drawn out music. The music of the 80s the hairbands all for the most part were great guitar players but there music was boring didn't rock much and the drumming was just awful for the most part and they all had this womanly scream and just weren't cool. Nirvana is a band that has one of the better if not the best drummer of the 90s with dave grohl mixed with novelselics pop baselines and kurts simple yet rocking riffs that are simple to play but who cares how simple they are they rocked and theres a reason why they became so popular, id like to see someone pull it off again and make it work. Its too bad they only made one more album. Im sure that this band would of been like the beatles of the 60s and 70s were they just kept on getting better and better over time. I also don't want to hear how he killed himself and he hated his fans and they were the least talented popular band ever. Ever heard of Jimmy Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Elvis Presley they all killed themselves as well they all rocked and were pretty damn influential. Also Elvis Presley only knew how to play 4 chords.

I'm a much more experienced drummer, and I could play these songs note-for-note in my sleep on the drums.  I could go on and on about how Virgil Donati or Dave Weckl would have been so much better on this album - but would they?Memorable riffs ... cool lyrics ... definite melodies ... the ingredients are here.  This is a GOOD album.This is very simple to prove:  ask 100 people on the street whether they've heard of Nirvana and whether they've heard of Allan Holdsworth, John McLaughlin, or Jeff Beck. Then tally up the results.  While just about anyone would agree that Holdsworth, McLaughlin, and Beck were miles beyond Kurt in terms technical ability and musical complexity (and most other guitar players too, for that matter), you will find that more people have heard of Nirvana than all the others put together.  What does that mean?  That the other guys are not virtuosos?  Absolutely not.  That people don't know good music?  Maybe, but much more likely it means sometimes you don't have to be the most technically advanced player ever to pick up your instrument to create music that people can enjoy and be moved by.\n", "val": 0.056338999420404434}

{"text": "What's all this talk about Nirvana killing rock and roll and selling out to the masses? It became popular and Nirvana couldn't be your little secret indie-cool pet band anymore, get over it! It was overhyped and overplayed but that was over a decade ago, and can't you forgive them for at least trying something new? Who sounded like this? Not the Pixies, not Husker Du, not even Killing Joke who sued them for nicking the riff from \"Eighties\" in \"Come As You Are\" and won, not the Replacements, not the Melvins, not anybody. Kurt was influenced by a lot of bands, and I'm glad he shifted away from the grunge Bleach sound and pulled this album off. It's a fairly clean-sounding album, but it's very consistant. Doesn't matter if it's commercial, Nirvana was quite good at it and there's a lot of soul in these songs, why should it matter if it's number 1 on the charts? The songwriting is good, the sound is huge and everything's clear. Think about all the crappy music people put up with in popular music of today and people are still complaining about Nirvana? That's completely absurd! I think Nevermind's the most consistant Nirvana album, but In Utero is produced better and comes quite close.\n", "val": 0.015638848766684532}

If you want to drive down the road, screaming lyrics and listening to raging guitar licks after a long, frustrating day of work, this album suits the purpose as well as any.

{"text": "The reason why I'm not giving this a full 5-stars is because this is pretty teent-bopperish, but all-in-all it is a very good album. This was Nirvanas breakthrough and their first major label release. Sure it wasn't their best (that would be 'In Utero') but it still had its fair share of greatness. It even started a whole rock-reform movement called grunge which (thank God) wiped out horrible pop-rock aka hairmetal and set the standard for countless bands to come. Most of those bands were horrible (like G@y Charlotte and S*!*ty Plan), but at least they can trace their roots to a good band (Nirvana) and not be so bad (yes people, I give those crappy bands 1 and 2 star reviews). Every grunge band was different (Soundgarden was the most creative, Alice In Chains was the darkest, Pearl Jam was the most melodic and Nirvana was all about simplicity) so that made the movement even more important .To sum it all up Nirvana basically popularized a genre that nobody thought would stand up to the almighty Van Halen, Metallica and Guns N' Roses.  This album got so big not only by 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' but also by its uniqueness.  The opening to 'SLTS' is a bit of a wierd one, but once the drums come out then WHAM! A load of grunge-driven rock slams into your ears and makes you keep coming back for more! The solo is pretty bad though, but like I said, Kurt was simple, meaning he wasn't a great guitar player yet he still managed to rock! Vocals are very good too, Cobain has a great range from the verse to pre-chorus to chorus. Rating: 9.5/10  'In Bloom' has that sort of feeling to them, not only is the bassline and the drumline good, but Kurt shows his great array of vocal talent and delivers it all in one great song, 'In Bloom' has to be one of my favorites. Rating: 11/10  'Come As You Are' is a very strange yet satisfying song. The lyrics may sound pretty dumb, but just remember: Kurt was a simple musician and those people tend to make goofy lyrics in some songs (we will run into this later in 'Lithium'). Krists watery bass intro is a must-have in a soft/heavy song like this. And at about halfway through the drums start getting louder and we reached the heavy part when Kurt sings \"When I swear that I don't have a gun\". A great song. Rating: 9.25/10  'Breed' is not one of the better songs on the album, but that doesn;t necessarily mean its bad. Its actually a fair song with more goofy lyrics and a simple solo, again not the best but definately worth a couple of listens. Rating: 7.5/10  Now we've hit 'Lithium' and this is where the dumb lyrics of 'CAYA' come back. The chorus could have been a bit more poetic then just \"Yeah\" but still, that word alone is just assuring you that Kurt is going through a nervous breakdown, so don't get bored of it. Theres also a pretty sweet 5 second bass solo here to, it demonstrates Krists' ability to play. Rating: 9/10  Its time for the acoustic softness of the serious yet soothing 'Polly'. Its about a 14 year old girl who got raped in Kurts hometown. I know it sounds a bit strange but this really shows the poetic side of Cobain and demonstrates that he can use acoustics much better than electrics. Rating: 10/10  Oh God, 'Territorial Pissings' is not the best song here, its okay, but compared to earlier songs it really gets the second half of the album a rough start. Its very fast paced but stupid if you think about it, even if the Ramones inspired it. The worst song on the album. Rating: 6/10  After track seven you'd think that the rest of the secong half would be pretty boring, but then 'Drain You' starts and immediately proves you wrong with some strange lyrics and great guitars. This is a very good song that has an interlude immediately following the second chorus, and then slams back into the tune that you've grown accustomed to. Rating: 9/10  'Lounge Act' is a lot like the previous track, but it has some suprising new twists in it too. After the second chorus Kurt just starts yelling like a freakin' maniac and sending some adreniline into you, the beat is very good too. Rating: 9.5/10  Okay, 'Stay Away' is a little too simple for me. There really isn't anything to this song escept for a pounding drum beat, its pretty boring if you think about it. Rating: 7/10  Right, now its time for the unbelievable 'On A Plain'. This song cannot be sung any better, it seriously got my attention the very first time I heard it and I couldn't stop listening to it. Although I'm not a huge fan of the chorus it seems that everything else was done absolutely perfectly. The best song on the album. Rating: 11/10  Now we come to the very emotional 'Something in the Way', and what an ending it is. Its about Kurt living under a bridge when he was a child, its another softee that tends to rock out loud. This is softer than track six because it has the cello in the backround. A very good song and worthy of a great ending. Rating: 10.5/10  Well there you have it. At least that stupid Avril fan was right about ONE THING, and that was that this album kicked ass! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!\n", "val": 0.0367770679295063}

They help set the bar for new bands trying to make it in the buisness. as for you avril, I bet you have never listened to any of the music that you are putting down, Avril is not Punk at all, I mean give me a break, if she lost the band and changed her clothes, she would be britney spears, another pop princess. as for good charrlote being the grand fathers of punk, you just prove your ignorance, the true Grand Daddys are the clash and the sex pistols, and if you can't think that far back with your narrow mind, what about bands like greenday, and offspring? I bet you don't even know who they are. then you say thay ST. Anger was mettallica's best album, now I'm hurt. it was the worst. try listening to master of puppets or ride the lightning, even the black album for god sakes, I mean st. anger? please. and there would not even be any of this music if it were not for people like bach and motzart, and betoven, as for limp bizcut being the creators of metal, that is very uneducated, they are not even metal, it is more like angry rock. Bands like rage, breaking benjamin, and korn fit this catagory, I like some of it, but biscut sucks hard no matter what. I look at your philosophy on music and I think I have figured you out, you even contradict yourself. you think anything new is good, and anything old is bad, or at least anything that wasn't made before 1990. then you say anything on trl is good. this is known as conformity, you agree with whatever makes you cool. try finding who you really are, I mean conformity is everything punk is against.

I guess Paranoia never heard about Kurt's dying want for people to have love and empathy for one another, or for his plea for people to respect one another no matter what color, type of sexuality, or any other flat-out differences they may have. When it comes to Nirvana's music, I like a handful of their songs, but I'm not going to lie and say everything they've done is gold, because only about 20% of Nirvana songs are worth listening to more than once. Songs like \"Pen Cap Chew\", \"Tourettes\", \"Scentless Apprentice\", \"Oh, the Guilt\", \"Anorexorcist\", and the unbelievably horrendous \"Raunchola\" from their 1/23/88 live show flat-out suck. Most of \"Bleach\" sucks too. No matter how much you want to deny it, there's a fine line between grunge and heavy metal. Most \"real\" grunge sounds identical to heavy metal, and I despise it all. On \"Bleach\", Kurt and the boys had the heavy metal sound, and all they needed to complete the image was the hairspray and spandex. \"Bleach\" had way too much metal riffage for my liking. Actually, any amount of metal riffage is too much for me, and as you can see, I despite heavy metal and anything that aspires to sound like it, including all of The Melvins and half of what Nirvana did... but thank godess that \"Nevermind\" sounds better than \"Bleach\".\n", "val": 0.0003031577216461301}

Give me a break, the Beatles actually had a decent guitarist (George Harrison), each of their records was a classic and they actually changed music for the BETTER. They also pushed new musical boundries and didn't recycle their own work over and over. What do we have to thank for after the grunge movement? Just look at the corporate 'top 40' crap being shoved down our consumer throats. 'Badass' rap, r&b (those words have lost all meaning), bubblegum pop, generic punk rock and generally music that rides on image not actual talent. Music has no substance today, bands with real talent are few and far between. Thanks a lot Kurt, thanks a bunch.As for the actual content. The music is fairly simple, painful vocals (nails on a chalkboard painful) and rambling lyrics. A lyrical genius? Since when does 'i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't mind i don't mind x 50' and 'A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido' (must have had his rhyming dictionary handy) constitute as lyrical genius? I'm sure people are looking for meaning everywhere, so the lyrics are very 'meaningful' to them. Simply throw the word 'god' in, add a few 'teenage issues', play some repetitive guitar, screech like you are a hungry child in Africa, wear torn jeans and presto, you sound like Nirvana.Worst of all, this music makes you feel depressed. Who actually LIKES feeling depressed? Do you really want to listen to someone crying about their 'teenage angst'. Just look at Nirvana's fans, i'm not making generalisations here, but look at the people dancing in some of their film clips. One word comes to mind: zombies.

I'm sick of seeing innovative, worthwhile bands who toil endlessly for regular gigs get passed over for a trio of untalented, lazy slobs who want to be the next Nirvana. Kurt Cobain set the bar as low as he could get away with, and the public just ate up every moan and whine that came from his slimy lips. The public still does. Any and all of the praise showered on this man for killing himself is sickening. Despite what Rolling Stone and MTV tell you, he certainly doesn't \"live on\" because of his music. He \"lives on\" because he killed himself. Nowadays, because of Cobain, any pimple-flecked reject with a guitar, no talent, and a nasally whine can get a record deal. Nirvana deserved none of the praise they garnered, especially for the paint-by-numbers Rock music on Nevermind. There's no way in hell that Nirvana can been categorized as Punk either. They lacked all motivation needed to make a statement, so therefore, they're not Punk. Nirvana is Rock purely for \"deep\" Jocks who don't realize they're Jocks.

Even 13 years after it's release it still remains fresh and as essential as it did back then! This album is a true masterpiece Kurt Cobain is the last real rock hero and no one in the modern world can compete.Smells like teen spirit - One of the most well known songs in rock history and well deserved even after a thousand listens this song will never become boring and is still as catchy as hell!In bloom - Kurt has realy got the loud/qiet thing off to a t in this song it is amazing. It is a mellower song but still has a catchey vibe!Come as you are - What a song! Nirvana songs never date and this would still explode if it was re-released an amazing mellow track.Breed - In terms of catchiness I give this song 10/10 who can listen to Breed and not shake their booty. Essential for nights alone when you can dance as bad as you like with no one in sight!Lithium - The loud/qiet is great again and the catchy mellow beat is still their. Wicked song!Polly - Probably my least favourite track, but full marks for trying something different. The lyrics make it somewhat haunting!Territorial Pissings - A full blown 10/10 for this song it rocks probably the most rock on the album it's amazing Kurts voice gets wild in the last chorouses of the song!Drain You - Another amazing song although not outstanding. Having said that theres not a bad song on the album, still cool!Lounge act - I love the music to this song it's kinda differnt to the average Nirvana song I love the song because it's different!Stay away - My second least favourite not bad but not my kind of song the verses let it down!On a plain - Amazing song mainly cos it brings back good memories. But cool song!Something in the way - About the times Kurt used to sleep under the bridge, it may not be rocks best ballad but it is an amazing song the lyrics are haunting and so emotional. It always reminds me of how lucky I am!Overall a fantastic album it realy is worth getting if not already got it.

It's hard to forget everthing you've heard and think of this as the be all and end all of modern records. But for me, it's the quality of everything here that makes it so special. Sure, there have been countless amounts of bands trying to copy the sound of this album, but none of them have come close to re-capturing it's finnesse in terms of an overall package.It's one of those rare albums that you can listen to all the way through and still have a hunger for more. It still sounds good after 13 years (as my father constantly reminds me), and it is still obvious why it is held so highly in everyone's regard.I love this album, and if I met someone who didn't, I'd strongly question thier taste in music.\n", "val": 0.06902370601892471}

Nevermind is a testament to that. Teen Spirit was the smash-hit, but is so simple it's sad. I wish there was more to Nevermind than meets the eye, but there isn't. There's less. It's all a bunch of meaningless mumbled words with the slur of a junkie you'd come to expect. Lithium doesn't even have a chorus. Any of the lyrics to Cobain's songs are interchangable.

Nevermind is an excellent album, and packs so much great songwriting, energy, and emotion that it has rightfully been called one of the outstanding records of the 90s. It opens with the classic grunge rocker \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and moves on the catchy \"In Bloom\", the infectious \"Breed\", the anguished \"Lithium\", and the melancholy \"Polly\". Kurt Cobain's ingenuitive songwriting, his passion for music, and his soul-searching lyrics really shine on this album, and he demonstrates the ability to write both slow, introspective tracks like \"Something In the Way\" and wild, raucus songs like \"Territorial Pissings\". Nirvana was a great band mainly because they had such a cohesive, earnest sound and were skilled at playing many different types of rock, from headbanging mosh-pit anthems to touching guitar-driven ballads. Today, Nevermind stands as both a rock classic and the quintessential record from the early-90's grunge era. Very highly reccomended.\n", "val": 0.0906190499663353}

{"text": "There's been so much better music that has come into the world since Nirvana that any of the band's \"contributions\" they made to Rock don't matter an ounce. Hmmm... \"ounce\". That should be one word that Kurt Cobain should immediately recognize since he was a ravenous junkie who lied to his fans, family, and friends about his heroin addiction. I still can't stand it when I hear people continue to speak of death conspiracies surrounding Cobain. Kurt Cobain was suicidal, plain and simple. His drug addiction compounded those suicidal feelings a hundred times over. Even the doctor who pumped his stomach in Rome after one of his near-fatal suicide attempts could tell he was a flight risk, and even worse: at risk of endangering himself-- that's why Kurt wasn't allowed to have windows in his hospital room. Yep, you heard right: a medical doctor who wasn't even familiar with Kurt's previous history of mental illness and suicide attempts could tell Kurt was suicidal. Read the full article (straight from the doctor's mouth) here: [...] As for Nevermind... well who cares?! The album wasn't relevent then and isn't now.

Of course most people will note 'Teen Spirit' as the stand-out track, but I beg to differ. As good as 'Teen Spirit' is - I beleive 'Something In The Way' to be a more revealing song. It talks of Kurt's supposed time living under a bridge in Aberdeen, Washington and is a genuinly moving song.

To a certain extent, this applies to all album reviews, but it is rampant for this album. Here we go...I was just scrolling through the reviews for this album, and I've realized that most of the 5 star reviews for this album are from complete idiots. They have no clue about music and I think most of them are MTV-conforming 8th graders with little intelligence, so I see how they can relate to Kurt Cobain :) Here are some quotes: 1) \"The beggining is scary\" [re: Territorial Pissings] Yes it is, maybe you should go watch Teletubbies instead. 2) \"This album marked the arrival of one of the true great musicians of our time -- Dave Grohl.\" LOL NO. 3) \"If you take time and listen to it and try to feel kurts anger and just try to understand the way he feels the maybe you'd feel more appreciative about this record. Kurt put everything that was going on in his life at the time into this record and look at the result\" Ummm... 99% of artists incorporate what's going on in their life... good point [sarcastic]. 4) \"They showed their talent when they did the MTV Unplugged in New York. They showed the whole world that they could really play\" Yeah, I can \"really play\" these songs too, cuz they're so freaking easy. 5) \"Track eight is a popular favorite \"Drain You\". This song illustrates the effects of love and hate. \"Lounge Act\" starts off with a great bass strum into a poppy chorus. Song ten is the screaming loud song \"Stay Away\". \"On a Plain\" follows as Kurt fills us in on his poor background and childhood.\" Nice one sentence descriptions. If it were so good maybe you could elaborate? If I could rate your writing ability I would give it a negative value. 6) \"...Kurt Cobains awsome guitar solos and screaming vocals. There is no duplicate of Nirvana. i've heard other bands try to play smells like teen spirit and its almost imposible to make it sound anywere near as good\" Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah? Too dumb to comment on. 7) \"Kurt Cobain used a lot of meaning to his songs and he should be credited for that, along with his great guitaring.

Nowadays, our music stations and channels are flooded with rap and rap-rock fusion. I see how everbody and their mother classifies Nirvana as \"Alternative\", but the true meaning of anything alternative, whether it be music or a way of life, has to do with its unconventional nature. Nirvana was as conventional and formulatic as music gets. They were absolutely predictable, as was Kurt Cobain, who did something all of us expected he would; he killed himself. He gave in to the cliche that all rockers should \"live fast and die young\". He was the ultimate conformist who loved bands including the likes of yuppie artsy-fartsy bands like Beat Happening. Kurt even had a tattoo that comemorated the corporation of K Records. Oddly enough it was owned and managed by Calvin Johnson, the Beat's yuppie singer!

For any of you who are interested in what killed 80's Rock and infiltrated Alternative, listen to this album.Kurt Cobain's voice is scratchy but he uses it the rite way.  He is no better than an average guitarist, but the genre of \"grunge\" didn't rely on that.  Krist Novelsevic is one of the greatest bassists ever as well as Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters) on drums.The CD kicks off with the overly catchy \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".  This is a heavy song that epitomises grunge.  Next is the loud rock song \"In Bloom\".  Upon hearing this, you'll find yourself tapping out the drums with Dave.  Krist sets a great rhythm with his pulsing bass.  The third single of four is \"Come as You Are\".  This is a bass heavy song that dwells on Kurt's \"take me for what I am\" thoughts.  The four song is the speed drumming, lyric slurring \"Breed\".  The fifth song and final single is catchy \"Lithium\".  A more up-tempo song on their alternative side.  You'll find this song stuck in your head.  The first acoustic song is favorite, \"Polly\".  This is an anti-rape song magnifying Kurt's views.  Truly a great song.  \"Territorial Pissings\" is a punk song coming from the bands early influences.  You might as well look the lyrics up before you listen to it.  Track eight is a popular favorite \"Drain You\".  This song illustrates the effects of love and hate.  \"Lounge Act\" starts off with a great bass strum into a poppy chorus.  Song ten is the screaming loud song \"Stay Away\".  \"On a Plain\" follows as Kurt fills us in on his poor background and childhood.  Finally is the acoustic \"Something in the Way\".  An extremely depressing ballad.  There is also a hidden track known as \"Endless Nameless\".  This is the Nirvana old fans are used to.  This song draws a wide variety of opinions but I love it, it's just so LOUD!Every song on this CD is great.  If you like the heavier songs, listen to \"Incesticide\"(1992) or \"Bleach\" ((1989)no Dave Grohl).  This CD is more like \"In Utero\" (1993).  It was their mainstream debut and was widely coppied by other bands, STP, Toadies, and early Bush.  This is a fantastic record and I would die without it.\n", "val": 0.025340577587485313}

{"text": "Grunge (thankfully) died along with Kurt Cobain a decade ago. Did the stamping-out of hair metal really work to the world's advantage? In my opinion, hell no. The surfacing of grunge gave hundreds of talentless, undeserving people careers just because of their \"homeless chic\" look and persona. Grunge is all about image and nothing more. Would you call a band grunge if its members never wore flannel and jeans regularly and didn't have choppy guitar riffs? No, you wouldn't. Now we're subjected to grunge rip-off bands that include the likes of Smile Empty Soul and Three Days Grace because of the sh*t Kurt made popular. At least hair metal bands gave us something to rock and shout about. Take, for instance, Twisted Sister. They were an innovative, talented group of crossdresser metal musicians who sang about how those of us who are considered \"freaks\" don't \"have to take it anymore\" (meaning being put down for our straying from what society considers \"normal\"). What did Kurt have to rock and shout about? Well, um, he had his own heroin addiction to whine about, and that was all. He also shouted about the Vanity Fair article that rightly portrayed him and his wife as the dope-shootin', child neglectin' unfit parents they are. By the way, I should also mention that Kurt made death threats  directed at the writer of said article because she let the world know the of Kurt and Courtney's neglect of their child. So much for Kurt's support for womens' rights! He repeately said he'd bash her head in. He was such a f*ck up! Nobody wants to hear about somebody else's problems you can't relate to when you could hear about ones that you actually can? No alienated teen out here can honestly relate to Kurt, because he was pushing 30 years old, and had more money than any of us will ever see in our lifetimes combined.\n", "val": 0.0001705148461041972}

{"text": "It's more like a 3.5-star CD (and I'm a huge, huge Nirvana fan, for the record). However, I feel like I have to do a little something to counteract all of the pointless 1-star reviews of the album. I have a piece of serious advice for those of you who bought this album because of the hype and found that it just didn't meet expectations -- go buy \"Bleach,\" \"In Utero,\" or even \"Unplugged.\" All three of those albums are much better than \"Nevermind,\" and maybe you'll find that you like them better. Don't dismiss Nirvana just because their most mediocre release happens to be the one that everyone picked up on and tells you you should buy. As for those of you who have never even listened to the album and just have fun tearing down Nirvana because you believe other bands are better -- well, you're stupid and you need to get lives, or at least start listening to CDs before you review them. Particularly you, AFI K or whatever.Now, on the actual CD -- it's consistent mediocrity, which can be good or bad. It's consistent in that there are truly no bad songs on the album, and there aren't many albums that can hold that claim. But it is mediocre. There are a few standout tracks, such as of course \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" \"Lithium,\" and \"Come As You Are.\" Personally, I find \"Polly\" to be one of the album's best moments -- the music is nothing complicated, but there's something to be said for simplicity in the music that doesn't detract from the poignancy of the lyrics. Most of the tracks are based on a poppy hook, which turns some people off (to those people I say I'm sorry you can't appreciate catchy, enjoyable music). But the fact is, the guitar parts here are not difficult, and while Kurt Cobain is a great lyricist, the lyrics here are not as good as on \"In Utero.\"To tell you the truth, I think the reason this album is different from the others is that it is not completely Kurt Cobain's show. This album marked the arrival of one of the true great musicians of our time -- Dave Grohl. His amazing drumming is the proponent of this album. Without him, the album simply would not have been very good.In conclusion, \"Nevermind\" is a pleasant listen, and it deserves credit for reviving good music, but it is not the band's best work by far. People need to stop going to the extreme with it -- it's not the best album of all time, and it's not the biggest piece of garbage of all time. Come on -- for it to be the worst album of all time, it would have to be worse than anything by Britney Spears.

Nevermind is a punk album w/ an introduction to grunge. Nirvana didn't create this sound, it was just the first album that was successfully commercial, thus they are legends according to the media. Oh well, Time to rate the songs, no questions asked.\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is obviously about the teen angst syndrome that haunted the society of the early nineties. \"Here we are now, entertain us...\" is forrunning motto of this generation. It's a good song w/ high emotion. Overplayed, yes, but still good.Another well known song in the second spot, \"In Bloom\" which not as depressing as the former, is still a classic. Still grungy, but this is Nirvana. One of the better on the album.My favorite song, \"Come As You Are\" is a dark melodic ballad where some of the lyrics are hard to pick up. Ironic in the fact that Kurt shot himself w/ the \"I swear, I don't have a gun\" part is repeated, but it's a great song to listen to when you need a good song to listen to.\"Breed\" is a more punk song than a grunge song. Nothing to great about it in my opinion, but no reason to skip it.The final single displayed is \"Lithium.\" Combination of subtle guitar riffs w/ stoic vocals and alt. rock head banging w/ a raging Cobain. Excellent.Some people might say that the rest of the album sucks b/c there are no other singles in it. The people that own it, know otherwise.\"Polly\" a 3 minute ditty about a parrott? Hardly. \"Polly\" is a poetic ride of Kurt's songwriting skill. The music isn't much though.The song w/ the most punk is \"Territorial Pissings.\" Here, the lyrics aren't really much as the song is pretty much one line over and over. Just a short punk song is all. Fun to play.The best non-single is \"Drain You.\" I actually like this song better than \"Smells..\" Something about it that puts you in the mood to do something constructive. I think I did my laundry to this song, oddly enough.A short Nirvana type song is \"Lounge Act.\" Many people like this song for it's uptempo style play. I, for one, wish it were longer.More of that punk/grunge feel is \"Stay Away.\" Lyrics are weak though. Sounds almost like \"Territorial Pissings\" in some parts.I love \"On a Plain\" for it's simpistic sound. The pace is constant throughout the whole song w/ the same drum beat most of the way. The lyrics are great and Cobain sarcastically sings the words in his usual depressed manner.The only song that doesn't have any punk to it is \"Something in the Way.\" Could be fitting for the last song perhaps as they stray further away from punk and rely heavily on the more grunge dark sound that \"In Utero\" perfects.Revolutionary? Not to me, just another album in my collection. Could be to some fans who are Nirvana freaks, but the band is gone and we all must move on to other things. As for the king of grunge, my vote goes to Soul Asylum, who transitioned from punk to grunge in the 80's.\n", "val": 0.0009388035396113992}
{"text": "Kurt Cobain's music was so safe and sanitary. Sure, the delivery was sometimes lo-fi (as on Bleach), but look at Nevermind, and you'll se what I mean. No band that constantly says they're for their fans is an honest band, especially a major label one like Nirvana. All bands have one main goal: To survive and make money. Everything else is an afterthought. When then-millionaire Kurt Cobain told teens in early 90's interviews that he felt alienated just like they did, it was the same thing as a Backstreet Boy singing to his fans in a huge arena that they were his \"one and only true love\" in 1997. Fans just wish they were that special \"one\" that the singer is talking about in their song, and they identify with that. Kurt found a way to cash in on that, and so he played into what teens wanted to hear. The problem with Nirvana is that they were never as musically-competent as Nevermind would have you believe. At best, Nevermind is simple, mediocre guitar rock. There's so much better music out there than Nirvana, and yet all of the band's hype blinds the easily-lead. By the way, Kurt Cobain was voted one of the most \"sexiest rock stars\", according to VH-1. What a hardcore Grunger!\n", "val": 0.00025666365399956703}

Nirvana was a horrible live band, so I personally think they were horrible period. Their pricey studio trickery they used to cover up their imperfections on Nevermind proves how cold and calculating \"Kurdt\" was. \"Artist\" my ass. If he really wanted an honest album, he could've re-recorded the songs for the album in his basement, and then sent THAT to Geffen. After all, Kurt had total creative control over everything Geffen got, so he could've changed it if he honestly wanted to. But, of course he didn't. He was lazy, left Nevermind the glossy way it was, and then watched as Sam Goodys everywhere stocked it for way much more than it was worth. Sure, he loved cassettes and vinyl, but when he saw fans having to spend over 15 bucks per CD, he didn't give a sh*t about his fans. After all, at least it wasn't HIM having to scrounge up that money. He was a famous heroin rock star now. Want a real taste of what Nirvana was? Then go out to Sam Goody's and plunk down nearly 20 bucks for Muddy Banks, and then have a good cry.

Good lyrics, nice soothing verses. 5/5Territorial pissings: A lot of people hate this. I know it is a bit stupid, but it's fun and catchy. 5/5Drain you: My favourite. Shame it couldn't have been released, it would have been a classic. Amazing lyrics. 5+/5My tracks that I think are good, but could improve a little are:In bloom: I know many people will wonder why I chose this one, but there's something about it I don't like as much. The chorus is ok. 4/5Come as you are: I don't listen to this one a lot. I always get it mixed up with \"Lithium\". 3/5Polly: I've heard this was based on a true story of some sort.

Enduring life through all the hardship and daily bullsh*t is Punk. Dealing with your own mental illnesses is Punk. Helping your fellow human being is Punk. And, according to John Lydon, erradicating lonliness is Punk. Kurt Cobain never expressed himself in a Punk way, or helped anyone like a real Punk would reach out and do.

Cobain has always been overrated as a singer and a songwriter...teen angst songs, how original!!  Again, listenable, but VASTLY overrated.  Certainly not a top 20 album of all-time (Rolling Stone magazine stopped mattering about 15 years ago).  Not even top 1000.  Critics make some poor assumptions in concluding that Nirvana were a great band.  Critics assume that because Nirvana was at or near the forefront of the grunge movement, all other grunge bands were copying them, and therefore they must be great.  But the fact is, all grunge bands sound pretty much the same, not because they were all copying Nirvana, but because grunge was a very limited, uninspiring style to begin with.  And I don't recall anyone screaming about \"greatness\" while Cobain was still alive.  If he hadn't been so weak and pathetic as to kill himself, Nirvana would be a struggling, forgotten band (can you say Pearl Jam?), just like grunge was a short-lived, ultimately meaningless movement.

Sure, it has some great rockers like \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and \"Breed\", but other than those, Nevrmind doesn't live up to anything much, including all the hoopla people make about it supposedly being \"the best\" album the 90's. Many other albums are much better contenders. \"Come As You Are\" gets stale really quick because it's so repetitive. Once you heard the first verse and chorus, you've practically heard the whole song. I never cared for \"In Bloom\" when I first heard it over ten years ago, and I still don't like it now. I think it has to do with that obnoxious guitar at the beginning and in the chorus. The bass really carries that song during the verses, and it's a shame the guitar has to intrude and ruin everything. I liked \"Lithium\" alot; it's not much of a rock song, but it sure is a great pop song. It's amazing how light and tame it sounds these days. It just doesn't have the same hard-edge I remember it having years ago. Kurt's voice sounds a bit airy and breezy, and it definitely gives the song a laid-back feel. \"Polly\" is very dull and not worth saying much about. You would've figured Kurt could've been a little more explicit and about the details of what exactly happened to this poor girl, but he just drops vague lines devoid of any emotion. It's hard to be moved by the ambiguousness of such a song. It always seemed like he was brushing off the fact that she was captured and tortured. You'd never know the song was about rape unless you found out the meaning of the song from Kurt's interviews. \"Territorial Pissings\" is just an obnoxious wall of screaming. \"Lounge Act\" and \"Stay Away\" have excellent basslines, but, again, Kurt's screaming ruins any build-up of tension or emotion. I liked \"On a Plain\". It's the most upbeat song on the album and it has a good vibe to it. \"Something in the Way\" is dull and vague like \"Polly\"; only this time \"Something\" is about a fictitious story Kurt made up. In it, he sings about what it would be like living under a bridge. Boring stuff. Too bad he didn't choose a better song to close the album with; \"Lithium\" would've been a better closer, and would've summed up the album and all the mood swings of the lyrics perfectly: \"I love you, I miss you, I like it, I killed you/I'm not gonna crack\".

{"text": "Reviewer: This_is_a_RadioClash from CAIt takes a fool not to realize that Nirvana and its sophomore album Nevermind are disgustingly overrated. Just look at the Amazon review of the album. \"Monumental urgency\"?! What a pretentious crock. If somebody would've recognized Cobain's \"monumental urgency\", and done something about it, he would've been put in a padded cell for a few years where he belonged. It's downright sick how the media kisses this dead man's backside. He killed himself, and yet people have immortalized him for it. Kurt Cobain's music is every Nirvana fan's afterthought. First and foremost, his public image is why people love him; he was the embodiment of the heroin-ravaged popular \"loser\". He was a good looking guy, so it was okay for him to \"rebell\" (i.e. act like he was an outsider when he was THE man to look to for being trendy). Another thing I don't like about Nevermind is how people were (and still are) claiming that it gave \"disillusioned\" and \"alienated\" teens a voice. I was one of those alienated and disillusioned kids, and I'm sure if I owned Nevermind it wouldn't have saved my scrawny frame from being beat down by the normals who loved Nevermind. Infact, they probably saw my not owning Nevermind and all the other popular jock rock as extra incentive to alienate us. Cobain, I salute you with a hearty \"F**k You\" for acting like you had life as bad as me and other teens. I can think of slews of late-80's, early-90's albums that were just as tweaked and polished as Nevermind, but had the balls not to hide it. Namely, Paula Abdul's \"Forever Your Girl\". I'm not kidding... that was a great record (\"Straight Up\" is catchier and rocks more than everything Cobain ever did). Sure, it was an album of sugar-coated, hard-edged love songs, but I'll take that any day over sugar-coated, downright lies (Kurt NEVER slept under a bridge, and wasn't a Punker).

There is not one track on this cd that is bad or even ok.  They are all great.  Everyone already knows the songs but if for some strange reason you don't then here are the tracks:1. Smells Like Teen Spirit-  Everyone should know this song since it was one of the most popular songs when Nevermind came out.  It it's a really cool song.2. In Bloom- This song starts with the coolest guitar part.  It's so simple but it sounds great.  The chorus sounds really good.3. Come As You Are- Mostly everyone knows all or most of the songs on the cd.  I have nothing else to say but amazing song.4. Breed- The lyrics are very odd and cool.  \"We could plant a house, We could build a tree\".5. Lithium- Kurt is a lyrical genious.  Nothing left to say.6. Polly- The first unplugged song on this cd.  All Nirvana songs that are played acoustic sound great.7. Territorial Pissings- They played this song on SNL so people probably know this one also.8. Drain You- This song, in my opinion, is the greatest song Kurt Cobain wrote. The words are incredible. \"Chew your meat for you.  Pass it back and forth. In a passionate kiss. From my mouth to yours. I Like You\"  In a way its like a cool love song with a guitar, bass, and drums in the background.9. Lounge Act- Maybe Kurt's second or third greatest song, once again, only in my opinion. \"Truth covered in security. I can't let you smother me\".  It is just a phenomenal song.10. Stay Away- This is most likely the least popular song on the album but it is still a spectacular song. It is definately worth listening to.11. On A Plain- This is a pretty good song.  He played it at the unplugged performance and it sounded just as good as it does with an electric guitar.12. Something In The Way- This is the slowest song I have ever heard but it is fantastic.

{"text": "(...)I will start by saying that I admired Nirvana and I LOVED the new life that they injected into rock music in the early 90's. The problem is, this record just isn't what everyone makes it out to be.Kurt Cobain was a lyrical genius, but some of the music on this record is absolutely impossible for anyone with a sense of pitch or timing to listen to. I know, I know, it's essentially a punk record, but a major-label debut album should have better songs on it, especially one that was hyped as much as this.Kurt Cobain was a media darling from the beginning, initially because of his outspoken attitudes towards the macho-types and support of women and homosexuals, and later because of his train-wreck of a \"family life\" with Courtney Love, daughter Frances Bean and his first love (heroin). When he took his own life in 1994, he became something of a tragic hero, and as a result, much more importance has been attached to Nirvana's music than it deserves. Period.\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and \"Come As You Are\" are the only songs worth having on this CD. If you want to hear some GOOD early-90's \"grunge\" (God, I STILL hate that word!), pick up Pearl Jam's \"Ten,\" Soundgarden's \"Badmotorfinger,\" or the one-off collaboration between those two bands, \"Temple Of The Dog.\"\n", "val": 0.0001656503591220826}

Lydon even wanted to work with Cobain, but that dream was (literally) shot to peices. He killed himself because he had the types of fans found here who gave Nevermind five stars and wouldn't let him live in peace and kept expecting him to churn out Nevermind II, III, etc. And now all we're left with is a rock album most people don't dare to question on any terms. I think we definitely should be questioning the quality of Nevermind, and how it was just a cut & paste job (Vig took the best takes from the band and constructed songs ala Dr. Frankenstein). We should also be questioning Nirvana and the horrible bands this record has \"inspired\", because he could've saw to it that this kind of agonizingly-dishonest \"grunge revival\" wasn't happening if he was still alive. We could've had Cobain become a folk singer for godsakes! That's where he wanted to take his music! And I would've enjoyed it! If Kurt would've had fans that appreciated diverse music, and accepted change, he probably would've been able to create music he was happy with instead of pandering to the likes of the people here that endlessly praise the silly, emptyheaded rock of Nevermind.\n", "val": 0.0001667619653744623}

Too bad Nirvana never could play SLTS even halfway decent live. That just goes to show how misleading everything off Nevermind is; You except the band to be just as good live, but they turn out to be just a bad joke... at the expense of the person who bought Nevermind. It's studio perfection courtesy of lots of electronic tweaking and trickery by Butch Vig. Kurt hated pop and wasn't man enough to admit lots of pop out there isn't all worthless bubblegum. Quite a few pop artists out there (like Des'ree) have quite a bit to says about how she views peoples' perceived roles in society. What has Kurt Cobain done lately for pop culture?

Nirvana had nothing to rightfully rebel against, so Kurt Cobain just made up things. Take, for instance, The Advocate cover story he did. Cobain thought he could be a spokesman for gay people just because people in high school teased him and said he was gay. The kicker is that Cobain asserted he was never gay, so again, why the hell was he allowed to do the interview?!

Where does it say that a song has to be difficult to be a great song?  Some of the most remembered famous rock, pop, country, you name it songs are not hard to play.  But that was just the thing about kurt cobain.  He would play the same four chords as everyone else but he could nail the perfect vocal melody over those chords better than anyone.

So you can make your own self-proclaimed comments(meaning comments that you have nothing to back up with other than it's your own stupid opinion) but just keep in mind that it's all music and not every guitarist has to be eddie van halen.  if you had never heard \"Come as you are\" before and i played the riff for you and told you to make up a melody for it you would not have come up with the same great melody line that Kurt Cobain came up with for it i guaruntee you that.

No. I'm now reading about how Cobain is supposedly Generation X's equivalent of John Lennon. I am lumped into the generation branded \"X\", and Kurt Cobain is not my John Lennon. Lennon is my Lennon. He is truly a legend because he left a legacy of love and freedom; Kurt Cobain is the polar opposite of him, so there is no room for comparison. Cobain professed his hatred for those not like him (he despised all athletes just because he had a few bad experiences with some in school). Cobain was also not for love and freedom, because he was bound by the selfishness and shackles of heroin addiction.Look at these \"profound\" lyrics, and have a good laugh (yes, they are the actual words straight from Cobain's pen: \"I'm on a plane/I can't complain\" (from On a Plain), \"I got my diddly spayed\" (Beeswax), \"You give, you give, you get/You get to me\" (Pen Cap Chew), and \"Little men eat and run/Poke your ass for the fun\" (from Pay to Play). Now that you're done rolling on the floor, now how many of you can honestly claim Cobain is Lennon-esque? I recommend anything by Lennon and the Beatles instead of Nirvana. But if you're looking for straight out-and-out rock mastery, I will say with high regard to go for Jimi Hendrix, the god of the guitar.

Nevermind stands above them all though. 12 unforgettable songs, highlighted by the transient beauty \"Come As You Are\",  the jealous punk of \"Lounge Act\", and the stark acoustic strum of \"Polly\".  While other grunge bands like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam were simply rehashed 70's arena rock, Nirvana combined a smart mixture of 70's punk, 60's pop, 80's indie and post-punk, to create some of the most vital music of their generation. No, Kurt Cobain can't shred; but he can write a better song then James Hetfield ever could.  I can't imagine you reading this review; with sales of 10 million copies in the US, and 22 million copies worldwide, Just about anyone who would ever want Nevermind owns it by now. If you don't, get it. Rolling Stone ranked it the 17th greatest album ever; I'd rank it more towards 8-10.

{"text": "Nirvana was a nice relief from all the crap they were spewing over the airwaves 14 years ago. With just the first few chords of Smells Like Teen Spirit, they started a musical revolution, de-throning the prince of pop, and forming a whole new subculture of flannel wearing grunge...people. (grungers? is that a word?) Out of this grunge era came some of the (in my opinion, anyways) greatest bands of all time. Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Sonic Youth, Pearl Jam etc. (and the not grunge at all, but equally good band, the Smashing Pumpkins.) And the reigning king of this grunge dynasty, the crowning glory of all grunge's achievements, was Kurt Cobain and his kick ass band Nirvana.Nirvana single handedly started the grunge movement with a song, and Kurt (God rest his soul) single handedly ended it with a bullet. While Nevermind might not be the groups' best work (In Utero gets the honour of being their best) it is still a great album. It is worth every cent you pay for it. It is one of those things that every body should own.Just as 14 years ago, the airwaves are once again polluted with crap. Fortunately, Nirvana's music is still here to save us from the overplayed crappy bands that dominate the radiowaves of today, just like they did back in '91.And now, especially now 10 years after Kurts death, it's nice to listen to them, and look back on the happier days, and remember grunge in all it's glory.

In a world where shallow, factory bands control the air waves; Nirvana was a shining beacon of emotion, angst, and artistic integrity that gave hope to people everywhere. Their artistic integrity was a comforting factor through out every riff and beat of this remarkable album, knowing that there was a person out there that understood what you where going through was amazing. Cobain became the friend of every person who understood and truly loved this album. It has been ten years since he left us here on this world to find a way without him, but his art is still here to show us that we are not alone. He is the John Lennon of Generation X; and in the ten years since he has been gone, no one has stepped up to fill the void.

{"text": "I still clearly remember the first time I heard the opening cords to Smells like teen Spirit.  The raking of the strings before a mighty explosion of drums and distortion.  I was there for music history, or at least around, it was 1991.  Ten years have passed since Kurt Cobain killed himself.  Now Cobain and the small punk band from Seattle are mentioned along the likes of The Beatles and the Sex Pistols.  Nevermind is truly an incredible album.  Outstanding in almost everyway, the album easily carries its weight as an all-time great.  Starting with those opening chords all the way to the hidden track.  It is as consistent as any great album and reviewed many times since the break out of grunge.I am writing this review to remind us of several things about Never Mind and Nirvana.  This album is a reaction or a result, to what was happening in music.  Nirvana and Never Mind have been given the miss leading title of the inventors of \"grunge music\".  Nirvana is looked upon as the creator of this style of music hailing from Seattle Washington. They are considered a leader and an inspiration to several other well know acts from the same area.  No one invented grunge music except for corporate America.  The so-called Seattle bands all had very distinct styles, and drew heavily from bands they admired in the scene or else where.  Nirvana was a punk rock band.  Drawing from the likes of  The Pixies and The Meat Puppets Nirvana hashed out their own brand of punk rock music.Bands like Nirvana had been there all along.  Sound Garden and Alice in Chains both considered part of the \"grunge\" movement had albums out as early as 1988 (Sound Gardens the Fopp EP).  Nirvana came about as a result of the over playing, the over hyping, and the lack of integrity in what is now termed big hair rock.  The reaction was a swing towards the alternative, punk rockers that played their own style, dressed the way they wanted, and really didn't give a crap about it.  Nirvana opened this door (and maybe closed it) because the world was ready for it and because MTV played the snot out of the video. The album was as polished as it was accessible and it broke into main stream America. Later less accessible Nirvana albums would reveal an edgier and less refined band that would bear their punk roots and there indie rock influences.The Movement was all over before it began and this truly great album may not have been the beginning but maybe the end of a great thing.  Nirvana may have not invented \"grunge\", but it did something greater for music and its fans.  Yes it rocked our socks off, but more importantly it told us it was OK to go out, be our selves, and discover our own music.\n", "val": 0.009887304157018661}

{"text": "Nevermind is a classic. Still, I'm finding it difficult to write a review that can express just how truly exceptional this album is for several reasons: first, I usually list stand-out tracks in my review. This simply can't be done with Nevermind, because quite frankly, every track is a masterpiece. Second, I'm not sure what exactly you'd call this record. Is it simply a rock record? Is it a pop record? Is it simply grunge, and nothing more? The fact is this album truly rocks, but there's nothing especially alienating about it, so it's also a pop record. And of course, this album has come to define grunge itself. In the end, it probably doesn't matter. If you haven't heard any of Nirvana's music, chances are you have been dead for some time. I'd get that checked out if I were you. Anyway, if you like anything you've heard by Nirvana even remotely, I can promise you that you'll love this entire album. And don't be fooled by the negative reviews. Even a classic album isn't for everyone (is there a single record in the entire world that is universally loved because I can't think of one). Fact is, this is one of the greatest albums ever made, and the only proof I can offer is that 14 years after it's release, it's still hugely popular. I still hear kids listening to Nirvana, and the band has never left my CD player for an extended period. This is the album of the 90's and thus far, nothing to come along in the 00's can dethrone it.\n", "val": 0.017895350232720375}

{"text": "I remember after the Geffen record release party in Seattle in 1991, my roommate had brought a promo copy of Nevermind home (it was part of the first pressing of 50,000 that accidentally edited out \"Endless/Nameless\"). Upon first listen, my initial reaction was that if this guy is gonna have \"sing-songy\" melodies like one would hear as taunts on the playground, at least make the lyrics understandable. Nevermind just didn't speak to me on any level. Otherwise, I loved how the drums sound.Months later, Nevermind was toppling Michael Jackson at #1, everyone I knew had a copy, and yet, oddly, in 1992 I was able to see Nirvana in concert on a whim by merely walking up to the box office minutes before the show and buying a general admission floor ticket, not sold out. Great show, glad I went, Helmet was great!I guess I found (and still find) Nevermind to be a very base album that taps into the emotional core of some people who closely identify with the angst expressions and taps into the core of the self-esteem of the peripheral wannabes who feel they must have and love Nevermind in order to be accepted by their peers. This explains why I never purchased Nevermind, but I did buy In Utero which I find more interesting to listen to.If I may be so bold, I would venture to guess that Kurt Cobain, were he alive today, probably would denounce and divorce himself from Nevermind. If you think about his personality and his approach to his art and its subsequent exploitation, you know my guess is an educated one. Nevermind is what it is, an album that unleashes a national emotion expressed from 1991-1994, its influence on bands measurable to a headbanging extent. But in 2004 it's like listening to Crosby, Stills and Nash ... the sound defines a certain era too closely to ever become timeless.\n", "val": 0.005637327209115028}

{"text": "Admit it: There were hundreds of of creative bands out there before, after, and during Nirana's nearly 13-year-and-counting stranglehold on the music world. They're still popular ten years after Cobain gave himself a shotgun facelift because kids these days are too lazy to go out and re-discover the amazing music of the past that they missed while in their mother's womb. Nirvana was never creative or experimental. I've heard every single one of their albums, the 1987 KAOS show, and their first show they ever played in March of 1987 in Raymond, WA. Simply put, the band blows dog. Same goes for their 1/23/88 gig they did after their Endino session. And do you know what Kurt opened the show with? He said to the audience, \"I have a big white di_k\". Nice opener for such an \"artist\" who was against macho posturing, huh? If you ever get to hear the Raymond 1987 show, it'll turn any Nirvana fan into a non-fan, as will 1/23/88. The playing is so bad that it's interesting--interesting to see that Nirvana (or Throat Oyster, or Ted Ed Fred, or Pen Cap Chew, or Brown Cow) was always so ammature. Nirvana never were as good as Nevermind portrays them to be, and the actual extent of their playing ability is found on the crapfest that is Bleach. Mumbling lines like \"Smell the smell\" and \"Pee-pee pressed against my lips\" do not get my creative juices flowing, nor do they inspire me to do anything besides crush the damn Bleach record, which I did. It p*sses me off to no end that Kurt Cobain is still wrongfully hailed a genius, while thousands of amazing songs have went under the radar due to the fact he wrongly overshadows the music industry with his music that nobody can relate to. Kurt Cobain wrote music for himself and nobody else. Nobody (not even a fan) can relate to someone like Kurt who didn't want to be related with. You may say you an relate to him, but since he would never reciprocate that adoration, you can't relate to him. He didn't want admiration; he just wanted to sit in the corner like he did a his own Nevermind release party and distance himself from everyone. He wanted to be forgotton, so just let the curmudgeon stay to himself in hell.

As of this writing the album is twelve years old.Propelled by the massive success of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" Nevermind took the world by storm. Nirvana and the other so called grunge rockers put an end to hair metal pretty quickly. Instead of sexually or fantasy driven lyrics Nirvana used cryptic poetry. Instead of leather jackets they wore flannel. Instead of guitar solos they used feedback. Yes, Nirvana had solos but none that would be compared to the over the top fretboard acrobatics of the shedders they left in their dust.If anyone still wonders why Nirvana was so successful let me clear it up for you. Not only did Kurt Cobain write some of the greatest,catchiest and melodic songs of well ...ever ...he possesed a powerfully emotive voice and sang every word with conviction. Even if you didn't know what he was saying you understood the feeling he was conveying.Some people didn't believe that Nirvana were good musicians. I believe it takes alot of talent to write a great song. While they may not play guitar like Eddie Van Halen or bang the drums like John Bonham yet they've probably had just as much influence on modern music as either one.

It rose to #1 on the Billboard charts, taking the place of Michael Jackson and \"Dangerous\".  Kurt Cobain and Nirvana became the most powerful and influencial group in the world.And for good reason: Kurt Cobain's songs reach a level of truth and reality, depressing and dark as it is, that few others have ever managed to achieve.  Those that would call Kurt a \"coward\" for taking his own life obviously have no idea of what he went through during his tragically short life: his parents' divorce and frequent fighting, the loss of three uncles who all committed suicide, his father's remarriage, being ejected from home after home and living, among other places, in his car (though never under a bridge, as \"Something in the Way\" says).Kurt Cobain was possessed of a raw talent that shaped rock as we know it.  And while Nirvana did not CREATE grunge, they are the most known group of the name, since the release of Bleach.  \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was NOT a song Kurt hated at first, but came to hate.What must be understood is that Kurt had a lot of problems - starting and ending with long-term, untreated chemical depression and his addiction to drugs (used, in part, to try and ease his own inner pains).  He came to hate \"Teen Spirit\" because everyone loved it, and he was sick of playing it.Cobain once wrote \"If you read, you'll judge\" on the cover of one of his journals.  And the phrase rings truest with those who judge him wrongly.  I encourage everyone, Nirvana fan or not, to read Kurt's biography, \"Heavier Than Heaven\" - and perhaps then you will finally understand the truth behinh Kurt Cobain and Nirvana.And maybe you'll respect them.\n", "val": 0.012456124648451805}

Talks about a guy who is completly strung out on lithium.6. Polly - 8/10 - A much slower song, also a great song to calm yourself down. A bit depressing, talks about his girlfriend, but it isn't a breakup song.7. Territorial Pissings - 10/10 - Great song! Really cool chorus. This also has a quicker beat and a lot of Kurt screaming.8. Drain You - 8.5/10 - A pretty good song, with a nice chorus. Like I said, not a bad song on the CD.9. Lounge Act - 10/10 - Another really good song.

{"text": "Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music. When you see it in its totality, his mark on the rock music scene was minimal, and his mark the music scene as a whole was detrimental. Most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include Kurt Cobain as an essential influence, but rock is regressing because Cobain is the man who allowed Nu-Metal and Hate-Rock to be bore from Nirvana. Nirvana had none of the passion, drive, and true grit that makes honest musicians stand out. Nirvana fans confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because Kurt says that's what it is. That's how easily-duped they are. When I see Kurt Cobain compared alongside Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and John Lennon, I find it sickening because Cobain, as he's been anointed by his fans and critics alike, is King of the Slackers. He was a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his \"heroine\" habit. A modern musician and artist I've stumbled upon recently is Tracey Chapman. Unlike Cobain, she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself has been persecuted. She spoke of all the desolation Kurt Cobain never faced but claimed he had. She spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied; Kurt Cobain just wanted to incite a revolution for spoiled middle-class kids from divorced parents to gain what they never were entitled to. Tracey's wails could both move people to tears and prove injustices of the downtrodden all at once. Could Kurt Cobain HONESTY do any of those things? No.When getting into music, I suggest anything besides whiny nasal bands, Nirvana, pop-punk, and any form of Metal, especially for younger people getting into the music scene. If you read that and ask, what else is there to choose from, I think the you've given in to the media already. Once teens discover Kurt Cobain, they think that just because the media and stuffy critics say so, that there's nothing beyond him, which is a lie. I saw bypass him and Nirvana altogether.I recommend: Tracey Chapman, The Cranberries, The B-52s, The Beatles, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, The Moody Blues, and anything else experimental or strange.

If this album didn't exist then neither would the sound of modern rock. No CD collection is complete without it, becuase every rock CD released after it, was centered around Nevermind. I will agree, this isn't the true core of Nirvana, but that doesnt make it a bad album, it just makes it different to their others. So stop giving it bad reviews becuase it isn't \"true Nirvana\", you're not rating it on that, your rating it on how good it is.\n", "val": 0.031078016385436058}

{"text": "Let me break this down, in a rather incomplex fashion, for all who are either considering the purchase of this CD or just reading the reviews to gripe and moan.  Nirvana, while rebellious, offered NOTHING new, or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era.  I understand, and even empathize with all the 'tortured souls' out there, but Cobain didn't speak to you. In fact, he loathed you, as he did all of his loyal fans.  That's the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such as Nirvana.  In following them, you are actually defying all that they stand (or stood) for, and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan.  In fact, by worshipping Nirvana, you actually become the very enemy that Cobain sought to destroy.  Learn this, and accept it.Secondly, the music (please, stop pleading otherwise) was diluted, poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity OR beauty.  His lyrics were NOT poetic, or abstract, or other-wordly, they were simply the lyrics of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist.  I also seriously shouldn't need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which Cobain attempted to play the guitar.  Let's simply say that his ability on guitar was less than passing.  In addition, the rest of the band members were also hardly virtuoso's.  So, you can cease in claiming that as well.Thirdly, an album's greatness depends solely on its ability to persevere.  The longevity of an album (inspect this postulate, it shows in what we now consider to be 'classic') is also completely dependent on the diversity of sounds and styles which the album employs.  Time has repeatedly shown this.  And, needless to say, Nevermind, and all other Nirvana albums for that matter, are about as diverse sonically as a ceiling fan.  That's three strikes Nirvana fans.  Yep, (0-3).  So...I'll leave you with a sagacious word (advice, if you will) regarding a better musical path which it isn't too late to pursue.  For the love of God (if one exists) heed my call, the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do...If you are planning on picking up, or playing, or praising, a Nirvana CD, and are doing so because:1. You despise society, and all that the archetypal American stands for, then you should listen to these albums instead:  The Velvet Underground - The VU and Nico or White Light/White Heat  The Mothers of Invention - Freak Out! or We're Only in It For The Money  The Fugs - The Fugs  Elliott Smith - Elliot Smith or XO  Radiohead - Amnesiac, Kid A, OK Computer, The Bends or Hail to The Thief2. You have a mild aversion to consumerism and/or love poignant, heartfelt lyrics, then pick up these albums instead:  Leonard Cohen - Songs of Leonard Cohen or Songs of Love and Hate  Wilco - Summerteeth or Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisisted, Freewheelin', The Times They Are A-Changin Blonde on Blonde, Another Side of Bob Dylan, or Bringin' It All Back Home  Billy Bragg - William Bloke or Talking with The Taxman About Poetry  Nick Drake - Pink Moon or Five Leaves Left  The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper's, Revolver, Abbey Road, White Album, Rubber Soul etc.  Yo La Tengo - I Can Hear The Heart Beating as One or And then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out3. You love heavy rock music and feeling angsty or contemplative, or love gruff or non-traditional sounding vocals, then you should listen to these albums instead:  Television - Marquee Moon  The Flaming Lips - Zaireeka, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots or The Soft Bulletin  Captain Beefheart - Safe As Milk, Lick My Decals Off Baby or Trout Mask Replica  Billie Holiday - Lady in Satin or Songs For Distingue Lovers  Van Morrison - Astral Weeks  The Pixies - Surfer Rosa  Morphine - Cure For Pain or Yes  Tom Waits - Rain Dogs or Swordfish Trombones  Jeff Buckley - Grace or Sketches for My Sweetheart The Drunk4. You simply love a great guitarist, then pick up these albums instead:  Leo Kottke - My Feet are Smiling, Greenhouse or 6 & 12 String Guitar  Robert Johnson - King of The Delta Blues Volumes 1 and 2  Jeff Beck - You Had it Coming, Blow by Blow or Wired  Dillinger Escape Plan - Calculating Infinity  King Crimson - In The Court Of The Crimson King or Starless and Bible Black  Built To Spill - There's Nothing Wrong With Love or Keep It Like A Secret  The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Are You Experienced?, Axis Bold as Love or Electric Ladyland  The Yardbirds - Over Under Sideways Down or Having a Rave Up  Wes Montgomery - Smoking at The Half Note or Full House5.  You just love well arranged, complex, moving or eclectic music, then pick up these albums instead:  The Zombies - Odyssey and Oracle  The Move - Shazam  Charles Mingus - Pithecanthropus Erectus, Mingus Ah Um! or Oh Yeah  Broken Social Scene - You Forgot it In People  Miles Davis - 'Round About Midnight, Steamin', Cookin', Sketches of Spain or Kind of Blue  Art Pepper - Plus Eleven or Meets the Rhythm Section  Love - Forever Changes or Da Capo  The Byrds -Notorious Byrd Brothers, Turn! Turn! Turn or Younger Than Yesterday  The Band - The Band or Music From Big Pink  Mahavishnu Orchestra - Inner Mounting Flame  Brian Eno - Here Come The Warm Jets or Another Green WorldP.S.  If you really desire something profoundly lyrical, read some poetry.  I would suggest Theodore Roethke, T.S.

This is a good starting point, but to really understand Cobain's art, check out \"In Utero\" with all of its virulent guitar sounds and sheets of white noise juxtaposed against beautiful pop melodies. \"Bleach\" is also a killer record--more on the poppier side of things, but great nonetheless.

{"text": "In the height of the Hair Metal craze, out comes this album from some unknown band from Seattle that instead of talking about partying and having fun, complains about life. This album is about 70% responsible for killing hair metal. The album had so many new sounding songs and everyone bought this on tape. Here's how the songs are rated.Smells Like Teen Spirit 10/10- THE song that defined the grunge movement. Great song even if most of the lyrics are unintelligible.In Bloom 10/10- A song if released as a single would be almost as popular as \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Great vocals by Cobain.Come As You Are 10/10- The other hit single was not as popular, but by no means is any worse. This one is not as overplayed as \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and is more likeable with memorable bass riffs.Breed 9/10- Pretty good song even though not as memorable as the first three. Lyrics are hard to understand, though.Lithium 10/10 Nirvana at its best.After this though, the album is all crappy songs, some filler, none memorable. From the beginning of \"Polly\" anyone can tell that the rest is awful. This still gets five stars because the first five songs are soooo amazing. Too bad that even though this album would change rock forever, and it's so good, it wound up being worse for rock than if it had stayed with Hair Metal for ten more years.

{"text": "So much has been made about how \"Nevermind\" inspired a generation and started a musical revolution. But the simple fact of the matter is that it did exactly that. Nirvana took the forefront of the \"Whatever\" generation, and gave them something to be inspired about. Also, this album changed music, transforming it from its glossed over techno-pop back to the gritty core of what made rock and roll special in the first place. Kurt Cobain's lyrics may not make any sense, even to himself, but to people who had nothing else to care about, they meant the world. Nirvana's music was raw and tattered, rough around the edges and aggresive, but this album was exactly what was needed on the scene at the time. Alternative rock became the ultimate counterculture to what was taking place on the radio and MTV at the time, truly letting the world of rock turn the corner. And Nirvana happened to be the posterboys that started this musical revolution, as unlikely as they are, and as unwanted as this position was by Cobain.The main problem with \"Nevermind\" is the production, which candy-coats the rawness that was Nirvana. For a better sound, the band stripped things down for \"In Utero\", which has the pure savagery that \"Nevermind\" should have had. But this is not enough to stop this disc from being an absolute classic, one of the most important albums of all time.There are several classic songs here, but I need not say anything more about the importance of a song like \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", a song whose opening chords still strike deep in an entire generation of lost souls at the time, who found a delicate solace in the anger of Nirvana.Whether or not you like the band matters not, as it is undeniable that \"Nevermind\" rescued us from the hellish songs of Snap! and C+C Music Factory. Now all we are waiting for is another Kurt Cobain to rescue us from Britney, Christina and Justin.\n", "val": 0.0023579930420964956}

I really must agree with Sebastian Bach (singer of Skid Row) when he says \"The song 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' really was the icing on the cake for glam metal\". In a way, this was a good thing, because it stopped horrible bands like Dangerous Toyz or Dokken making it huge like Poison or the Crue, and brought along excellent bands like Alice In Chains. But the most popular, well-known grunge band is Nivana. I never understood that, because Alice In Chains were so much better. Nirvana had musical potential, but never lived up to it. After this album came out, I found myself missing the likes of Twisted Sister, Poison and Skid Row. This album is very raw and agressive - and I like raw, agressive music - but this really never cought my ear. I really enjoy Teen Spirit and Polly Wants a Cracker, and a few others - but other than that, this album never really appealed to me. Too much teen-angst, droning and moaning. Kurt Cobain was a good lyricist, but never brought it too full potential. Even being as catchy as it is, this album gets very old and repetitve very, very fast.

{"text": "I know most people will never agree with me, but \"Nevermind\" is responsible for my mistaken idea for so many years that what was classified as \"alternative\" basically is violent loud noise with equally violent lyrics if one can comprehend them.The record, overplayed on radio ever since its release was supposed to signal the end of the 80s, an era whose commercial music I absorbed for a number of years as completely as possible. Though critics' constant derision of commercial music of the 1980s does have some truth to say the least because so little (many would say NONE) of it has stood the test of time, this does not mean \"Nevermind\" is made any more worthy.The whole record, to my perhaps insensitive ears, was just a melody-free feast of guitar noise that really had little meaning even in the softer passages, which really disguise what the songs turned into during their tuneless choruses. The muted \"Come As You Are\" really was overblown stadium rock under another name, with Kurt's emotion really hiding his distaste for some sort of feeling towards those he refers to. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was even worse, basically soulding like a slower version of hair metal like Poison even if Kurt's wanted his lyrics to be completely different. The verse-chorus structure was exactly the same as that of a power ballad like Heart's \"What About Love\" - only more amplified and detuned.Whilst the line (actually not the real lyric, but I heard it that way for years) \"I kill you/What's that gonna change??\" suggests that Cobain was so nihilistic he cares about nothing and nobody. The lyrics of the other songs are in many ways quite similar even in their correct versions, whilst there was never really anything distinctive about the music.If you really want to see some inventive, tuneful music from the 1990s, try Portishead's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/PNYC/dp/B00000DLV1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">PNYC</a>&nbsp;or Laika's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Silver-Apples-Of-The-Moon/dp/B000006AZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Silver Apples Of The Moon</a>.

And Pearl Jam might of come first but that doesnt mean Nirvana had tremendous talent. I think Pearl Jam might have the edge because they have more CDs, now Nirvana can't help that they don't have more Cds obviously because of Kurt's horrifying death but I will say that Nirvana seemed to have more talent than Pearl Jam(sorry hardcore Nirvana hating Pearl Jam fans) and the reason why Nirvana had the spotlight over Pearl Jam is because Kurt was such an interesting person and was full of surprises and was such a talented individual. Now Pearl Jam did prove that being on MTV and getting all the attention doesn't mean your better because Pearl Jam's record titled \"Ten\" sold more than Nirvana's \"Nevermind\".

It began when a friend of mine recommended \"Nevermind\" to me. I was reluctant as I labelled them with that woe-is-me, angst-ridden mosher band, but I admit I was wrong. I saw some of their videos over the Christmas period, and really began to dig them. I then bought Nevermind on the spur of the moment from Amazon. I'm so glad I did. This is a masterpiece!When Nirvana were being hailed as the greatest band in the world I was four years old, and not into much apart from the Rugrats. Little did I know that they were tearing the world apart, revolutionizing the music scene and selling 10 million copies of their second album Stateside. It's not hard to see why this album is often hailed as the greatest album ever. It's not my favourite album ever - nothing will ever topple Alanis' \"Jagged Little Pill\" - but it's up there high on my list.The album opens with the masterpiece \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" This is one of the most popular songs of all time, and it's not hard to see why. Everyone knows this song. No matter how you live your life or what backgrounds you come from, you WILL have heard this. The guitars are masterful, and Kurt's screeching vocals reflect his tumultuous state of mind and his tortured soul. \"In Bloom\" is a great rock-pop anthem, with a deep and catchy bass. The lyrics are simple and the chorus is just anthemic. Kurt sings about a guy who likes all his pretty songs. He likes to sing along and all that, but he doesn't know what it means. He's a crowd-follower, which Nirvana certainly gathered many of, not under their control. \"Come As You Are\" is one of my favourites on the album. The deep bass that opens the song is so famous, and the vocal arrangement is very melodic. It's just a song about being who you are. Keeping it real and living your life as you.\"Breed\" is another one of my favourites. The guitars on this are just so awesome, and the verses are excellent. The lyrics come in short swift strokes, and repetition is used to maximum effect. The chorus is fabulous and Kurt's vocals are just so majestic. \"Lithium\" is a favourite amongst many, but I myself am not that keen. Sure, it's a brilliant song, but compared to the others on offer here, it doesn't live up. \"Polly\" is the most simple song on the album. The four-note lyric style is reflected throughout the entire song, which adds this simplicity to it, along with the simple guitar. The subject-matter is more than disturbing though. \"Territorial Pissings\" is another highlight. With a really funny opening, the beat comes in loud and hard. After the 16th second of the first minute is passed, the beat really drives in. It wedges into your brain, until Kurt's shocking vocal display at the end. He's almost screeching in pain and torture.\"Drain You\" is probably my favourite unreleased song from the album. I think the lyrics, in part, are just vile. Listen to them and you'll see what I mean. However, the chorus is brilliant, and the verses have rocking guitars. The best part of the song comes after the second chorus, though, when the spooky scary bit kicks in and Kurt's voice echoes the word \"You...\" The guitars are awesome on here. \"Lounge Act\" is a brilliant but short song with a subdued first chorus, which then is repeated again in such a loud and screaming manner. It's brilliant. \"Stay Away\" has some really wicked guitars and the lyrics are sung so fast. I love the chorus. Everything about this song is perfect. \"On A Plain\" is another really good song. Kurt's background vocals are really good, and the beat sounds tampered with at the beginning. \"Something In The Way\" is the perfect album closer. It's the slowest song on the album, and is almost peaceful. The guitars are full of sorrow and Kurt's voice is on top form once more. Nothing bad about it.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10There aren't many albums that I can listen to where I love the songs on the first listen, but Nevermind is definitely one of them. It's also an album with not one bad song on it. Some people have criticised this album, and I can't see why. Once a band experiences success and sell a few million copies, the 'cool' underground dudes have to rip it apart. Just because they like to be unique and all that. Forget all that. Listen to this masterpiece album. It changed so many people's lives, and it's not hard to see why. I'm reading \"Heaven And Hell\" at the moment, and it's a wonderful biography on Kurt's life. I'm really relating to the way her felt sometimes and I already look up to him for his music. Tragically, he would be gone just less three years after the release of this album. Buy it, listen to it, worship it.\n", "val": 0.036194127053022385}

I discovered them just last year, and since then its needless to say that Nirvana has become my way of living , my religion. And there are many reasons for that. Nobody can't denie that after `Nevermind` rock was changed, the music was changed, the fashion industry was changed, the way of living was changed, the entire world was changed, and I can't believe that some of us here say things like : \"overrated\" ,\"just average\", \"led zeppelin better\", \"limp bizkit better\" , \"britney spears better\"..., bla bla bla.

{"text": "the most overrated album of all time.  Cobain spoke to many, but not me.  I'd heard all before, and done by better, with real heart and a sense of humor, in the form of Paul Westerberg.  Let's face it, Nirvana was the lucky band at the right time.  College radio and alternative music was bubbling under the surface throughout the '80's.  Yeah, the grunge movement helped to kick the 80's pop-metal trash off MTV.  But, after the succeess of the Seattle scene, we were subject to the horrors of the likes of Bush and Creed.  UGHHHH!!!  Cobain was right to have his insecurities about his success.  Many before him set the table, and he was greeted as king.  Imagine the horror to Killing Joke fans when the killer riff of \"Eighties\" ends up being blatantly ripped off for \"Come As You Are\".  (Heck, he basically ripped off the Beatles \"Things We Said Today\" for \"About A Girl\", so such overt plagiarism should come as no surprise.)  And, the contempt Cobain showed for his audience on \"In Bloom\" was rather disgusting.  If anything, \"Nevermind\" was nail in the coffin of alternative/college radio.  Even REM made a medicore album, \"Monster\", in response to \"Nevermind\".  I'd just assume go listen to any of Grohl's work in the Foo Fighters before putting this CD in my discman.\n", "val": 0.0001624677679501474}

They are all, (in my mind), somewhat incorrect.Nevermind is obviously the most popular Nirvana CD, as many of its' songs made it into the rock charts of that era.  It was a good cd though.Pros-Creative lyrics-A \"heavier\" sound-Dark melodies and creative lines that i would never of thought-Plain heaviness and coolness, with the underground feel (whoa there, i only said feel, not that it is underground).Cons-Everyone has it (you are not special to own this cd)-Rather inconclusive guitar playing (ah, i guess this is what made it grunge . . .)All in all, good stuff.Then again, maybe not so good stuff.But for the 90's junkie, good start (or finish).\n", "val": 0.009382848627865314}

Pearl Jam didn't begin to pick up speed until well into Nirvana's career.  Next, to say Jane's Addiction was revolutionary is far-fetched.  Most of thier appeal came from the shock value.  Finally, this band is way more passionate than any macho, power metal.  Guns N' Roses was just commercial fluff, Megadeath drowns out their music with their cheesy solos, and Zepplin doesn't even get their music.  If you'll recal, Mr. Plant doesn't even know what Stairway to Heaven is about.

Nirvana was just a terrible, noisy band. That's it. Their riffs were horrible, their guitar solos frightening, Kurt's voice like nails on the chalkboard. There were so many bands during that era, most of them far ahead of Nirvana when it came to talent and songwriting, but they never got the credit they deserved.

{"text": "i am getting tired of pearl jam fans trashing this album, and nirvana fans trashing pearl jam fans and glorifying this album.  Come on folks.....  i read in rolling stone the other week that this album was rated in the top ten of the top 500 albums of all time.  That just makes me see how this album can be overrated, as far as musical greatness and diversity goes.  Don't get me wrong, i still like the album.  It has a good sound and i think this album allowed for bands like alice in chains, pearl jam,  and soundgarden to let their sounds hit mainstream.  i just found it strange how bands like soungarden had already been around for a while, doing their amazing music, and all the sudden they are recognized when this album comes out.  i can see how this album may be held up high because of its ability to bring other music out, but when you break down the album, the music isn't anything god-like.  Good songs, but after listening to the meat puppets and the pixies, you can definitely hear where Kurt got his influences from. I personally think that In Utero was the best Nirvana album because some of the material in it was more mature sounding and a little more diverse.  I think it would have been interesting if Kurt could have straightened out and made more music, hopefully something a little more musically diverse than Nevermind.What caused this album popularity and the emergence of grunge was nirvana's willingness to become mainstream.  Other bands came out too, but i don't think it was Nirvana's music that everyone was following as many say, especially those who hold the album up so high.  You look at other grunge bands and their music is quite different and unique.  So pearl jam fans:  see how this album had some good music, but more importantly helped bust grunge out of its cage.  Nirvana fans: nirvana was great, but hey had a weakness that caused the band to collapse, and you can see it in the music.  Pearl jam is the only band to survive that era and are still putting out good music. (check out Lost Dogs, unique releases)\n", "val": 0.05404844135046005}

{"text": "It's difficult to review \"Nevermind\" today since it has such an aura to it- of its 12 songs, 10 are now classics, and of course it was involved in such bigger things as the destruction of 80's pop and the beginning of the 90's rock boom that we still feel today.  In pure musical terms, \"Nevermind\" is still a great listen a full 12 years from its release date.  The Amazon.com reviewer probably said it right- it all sounds so familiar now just because millions of bands have tried hard to copy its style.  However, when this was released, it was something new, and had the full energy of a young band attached to it.Looking past the immortal \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", \"Nevermind\" has several other greats.  Every song flows together perfectly with the others, with every track standing out in its own way.  \"Nevermind\" lacks the pure raw emotion that drove its successor \"In Utero\", but this is great for a pure adrenaline head-banging album.  \"Lithium\" and \"Come as You Are\" could very well be two of the greatest rock singles ever.  Few bands could match the ferocity of \"Territorial Pissings\".  \"Something in the Way\" is as moving as it is haunting.  There are hidden gems on the album as well, such as \"Drain You\" and \"Lounge Act\".The album's only possible flaw is that it can be a bit too melodic.  Especially near the end, the songs start to sound the same somewhat- \"Nevermind\" lacks the musical diversity of a Pearl Jam or Soundgarden album.  However, this is still a terrific recording, and worthy of its mantlepiece of one of rock'n'roll's most popular and immortal albums.And finally I have a message for Pearl Jam and Nirvana fans.  I used to buy into the whole Pearl Jam-Nirvana rivalry (see my \"In Utero\" review), but it's really quite pointless.  They're both terrific bands and I respect them in different ways.  Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder ended the rivalry ten years ago (they were even going to play an MTV gig together at the end of 1993), so why it still continues amongst their fans I don't understand.  Reviewers like Nirvanadude and Nirvanadudeblows need to chill out.

{"text": "\"Nevermind\" is the album that revolutionized mainstream rock music. While not necessarily grunge like its predecessor \"Bleach\" or even \"In Utero,\" there is no denying the impact Nevermind has had on the music industry. As a big Nirvana fan, I would say Nevermind is Nirvana's second best album behind In Utero. Nevermind is certainly more radio-friendly and popular and with good reason. I'm going to rate each of the tracks as unbiased as possible to give you an idea how good this album is. It is one of the best of all time.1. Smells Like Teen Spirit - Their most popular song, if you haven't heard this you probably haven't turned on the radio or TV at any point during the 1990s. It's an amazing song that summed up the frustrations young people were going through at that time. This is one of the greatest songs of all time. 10/102. In Bloom - Another hit single, In Bloom is about their fans. Also gets a lot of radio play and is one of their best. 10/103. Come As You Are - A great song that has an amazing beat. Another hit single on the radio constantly.  10/104. Breed - More of a Grunge/Alternative Rock sound to it, this one sounds like it can come right off In Utero. 9.5/105. Lithium - Yet another amazing song, about bi-polar disorder. One of Nirvana's best. 10/106. Polly - A song about rape in the perspective of the rapist. A good, solid rock song. 8/107. Territorial Pissings - A loud, noisy rock song with the beginning of it showing Kurt Cobain's Beatles' influence. This is probably the worst song on the album but it is not bad at all. 7/108. Drain You - One of my favorite Nirvana songs of all time. 10/109. Lounge Act - A grunge song that sounds a little weird but there is no denying its sheer power. 9/1010. Stay Away - It's good but not as good as the others. 7.5/1011. On A Plain - A great grunge song with sarcastic lyrics. 9/1012. Something In The Way - A mellow Nirvana song which shows Kurt's emotions. A nice relaxing song to listen to, and I find it similar to In Utero's last song, \"All Apologies\" although Something In The Way isn't as moving. 8/1013. Endless, Nameless - For those of you who aren't hardcore Nirvana fans, this is the secret track on Nevermind. There are several versions of the lyrics to this song and its meanings have been questioned. It doesn't sound like anything off of Nevermind and since it's not on the standard copies I won't rate it.Well there you have it. One of the greatest albums of all time summed up track by track for you. Hope this helped. Oh and by the way, BUY IT. IT'S AWESOME!\n", "val": 0.031147142872214317}

Cobain shows range of vocal styles by ranging from a somber and heartfelt voice to controlled rage. The drums of Dave Grohl and the bass of Krist Novoselic holds the songs together to form beautiful and catchy melodies.  Nevermind  is filled with musically versatile songs. Songs like \"Polly\" and \"Lithium\" showcase the melodies that are under the hard and abrasive songs such as \"Breed\" and \"Territorial Pissings\".

{"text": "Nevermind...what can be said about this album that hasn't been uttered a million times before? On this record, Nirvana shows the distraught, messed up, sloppy, honesty we can all relate to. Nevermind pumps out great songs one after the other which is an implausable, if not impossible act...Here are some of my favorites on this record and how they measured up.Track 1: Smells Like Teen Spirit, This song is one of the best songs ever written! Lyrically speaking its a gold mine with the kind of lyrics we can all listen to and say \"Yeah, I know how that is.\" This songs lyrics would have easily been enough to carry it to the top, but with Krist Novocelic and Kurt Cobain's monumental guitaring and Dave Grohl beating the drums like a madman with really good rhythm make this song a masterpiece. 10/10Track 2: In Bloom, Beautifully agressive riffs combined with steady but still shocking drumming make this song (about a macho jock type singing along to a song he has not the least bit of knowlege about) the kind you get stuck in your head all week long and don't mind. 10/10Track 3:Come As You Are, In my humbled opinion, this is by far the greatest song on Nevermind, its hauntingly melodic guitaring make it unbelievable, but Kurt Cobain's heart-felt words of acceptance ,make CAYA unforgetable. 15/10Track 5: Lithium, This song is your classic obsessive love song with a NIRVANA twist. Quiet guitar and slightly noticable drums during the refrain, with lyrics that paint the picture of a disturbed person who is trying to convince themselves its all alright. Then, the chorus hits and the guitar explodes in an astounding display of genius and sheer discontent. The songs somewhat disturbing Chorus make this song a classic:\"I like you I'm not gonna crackI miss you I'm not gonna crackI love you I'm not gonna crackI kill you I'm not gonna crack.\"10/10Track 6: Polly, Many people say many different things about this song...thats its a song of poetic justice (A man rapes a woman, is sent to jail and raped himself), a song of how Courtney >shudder< and Kurt were raped by the interview in Vanity Fair that got Frances Bean Cobain taken away, or a ironic anti rape song that was misunderstood by the public, and was actually used as background music in a real rape film...but one thing most people can agree on is its sensational, simply put, its the genius thing most people strive for their entire lives.Track 11: On A Plain, A little less agressive than some of the other tracks on Nevermind, this songs catchy but somewhat undeveloped lyrical direction which plays on a number of things including song writing, his childhood, and tapped into his addiction. The guitar is just as influential as in the other songs on Nevermind as well as the drums which leaves you wanting more. 10/10...\n", "val": 0.03287585824728012}

While it's true that it was revolutionary and changed the face of mainstream music forever, it's still not that great of an album.The songs are extremely poppy and pleasing to the ears on the first few listens, but this gets old really fast.  How many times can a human being take \"Smells like teen spirit\"?  The album hasn't aged well at all, and there are and have been many, many, MANY bands with the same type of sound as Nirvana who can pull it off a million times better.Many people claim this as the album that destroyed bad hair metal and reshaped the course of rock.  \"Pffft,\" is what I say.  The only thing this album gave us is those stupid, pseudo-angsty nu-metal bands (Staind, KoRn, Trapt, Chevelle, Seether) that are clogging the air waves and are the bane of real music fans everywhere.If you're looking for some REAL grunge/alternative, pick up Surfer Rosa by the Pixies.  This is the album that Kurt was trying to ape when he recorded this pile of dung.  Even compared to other grunge bands of Nevermind's time (Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains), the album is a joke.Don't give In Utero the skip, though.  Kurt quickly realized what a monster he'd created with Nevermind and decided to record a REAL album.  The result was In Utero.  THAT album gets 5 stars.\n", "val": 9.320784010924399e-05}

{"text": "Twelve years can do so much. It still seems like yesterday when you tuned into MTV and saw a grimy pep gathering in a rank gym. A clean, impossibly simple chord progression suddenly lurches into heavy distorsion while the drums threaten to bash your skull in. And in those 12 seconds, a legend was born; the orgasmic, angry rush of Gen-X was completed, and the world changed. It was the penultimate musical and cultural moment of the decade, the end of one era and the start of another. Or so we thought. Of course, we all know the sad story of the brilliant, magnetic and utterly tormented Kurt Cobain: a nobody with no intentions of going big, suddenly on top of the world with more adoration than he can handle, in the cold ground within two years. Before Kurt and Nirvana, the music world was a festering wasteland: after him, the music world was a festering wasteland, with pale imitations of his brilliant band that only make life worse. No band has had such a sudden and immediate impact on the culture since perhaps the Beatles (Joy Division's was more gradual, though just as short). And even though Nirvana would make a better album in \"In Utero\", they would never top the impact of \"Nevermind\" and its still-excitable and awesome tracklist that reads like a greatest hits on its own. It could be argued that this album isn't as strong as people would care to think; that it didn't really change everything in the long run, but rather killed rock and opened the doors for the Teen Plague. That the songs are dilute Pixies tributes (a thought supported by Kurt himself). That it was overproduced. None of these facts could be argued against too easily, but the one fact that is interchangable is the fact that this album was American rock's last hurrah; enormous in its impact, bigger in its lasting influence. People will tell me that Bjork, Beck or Beastie Boys deserve the top spot, but I have to disagree and give it to the little blond man who came to us as if straight from heaven: infallible in his short career, touching so many lives and tearing apart so much more in his selfish final act.

I don't feel this album is overrated at all, like I saw some others write. Although it was majorly commercial when it was released, the album is very good and the ultimate grunge album to own.\"Smells like Teen Spirit\" is a rock stadium, angst teenagers hit, but very catchy and with alot of emotionally satisfaction.\"In Bloom\" was also a hit with mainstream, and a good follow up to \"Smells..\"\"Come as You Are\". Another hit. You may think by now that, \"Yeah, its a bunch of mainstream hoot-nanny that I am too good to listen to.\" Not so. A slower song, and very memorable. Although my least favorite of its singles.\"Breed\" is one of my least favorites on the album. I sense they lost some of the energy of the album here, but thats ok, because the next track \"Lithium\" is one of the best. This song is a fan favorite and is a total Kurt song. You can really feel emotion flowing through your speakers on this one.\"Polly\" \"Territorial Pissings\", and \"Drain You\" are very well written and \"Drain You\" is a classic, and fan fav. as well.I'll now skip to the last track, \"Something In The Way\" which may just be Nirvana's best song.

{"text": "Wow. First of all I don't really know where to begin, since this album has absorbed itself into pop culture (perhaps reluctantly), and most people already own it. But I think this album is great not because it had hit songs, or that it sparked a grunge revolution at the time, but because it is a very powerful statement, and its raw depth is enormous. I got into Nirvana around 1998, which would have made me about 16 at the time. During this period, I had previously only listened to 70s arena metal bands such as Kiss and Deep Purple. But I remember one time I was sitting in my room, doing homework with the radio on, and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" came on. I had heard of this song (and maybe heard it passing a few times in the past without thinking much of it), but, on this particular night, that song truly resonated with me for the first time (maybe it was because I was at the right age), and I vividly remember being unable to get that catchy chorus out of my head. I went out and got the album, and, for the following month (maybe two), Nevermind was all I listened to. I got into alternative music largely thanks to this album, and I owe Nirvana a lot for that. The opening track is, of course, the infamous \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" which moves along with that now-immediately familiar guitar riff and indecipherable lyrics. \"Come As You Are\" and \"Lithium\" also received air time, the former with its \"flangy\" sounding guitar solo (which sounds like it was recorded underwater, this as well as the video for the song tie in with the \"water\" theme on the album cover). Other noteworthy songs include \"Drain You,\" \"In Bloom,\" the raw punk rockers \"Breed\" and \"Territorial Pissings,\" the acoustic tracks \"Polly\" and \"Something in the Way,\" and the perennial pop nugget \"On a Plain.\" The only complaint I have (and this is very minor) is that the production is WAY too slick and clean for this kind of album. However, the album still seems really lo-fi in comparison to a lot of the stuff that followed it. Kurt Cobain's excellent songwriting abilities are evident throughout the album, and the exciting rhythms produced by Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl really push the music to a higher level.I have to admit that I'm slightly more partial to this album than the others simply because it was right there with me for so long during high school. Every song resonated with me, and being a loner like Kurt, I could definitely understand where he was coming from at times. Even four years after he died, I still believed in Nirvana. I still listen to this frequently because it means something to me.Over the past couple of years, this album has really been overanalyzed by a lot of people, and I think that's missing the point. When you listen to Nevermind, you don't think or be analytical...you just feel the depth and emotion. To me that says more than anything. If you are a teenager who is searching for some music that actually has worth, I cannot recommend this album enough.\n", "val": 0.004563518799841404}

Come As You Are has a very similar riff as the Killing Joke song called Eighties.Maybe it's just coincidence that two Nirvana songs sound kind of like other songs, but it's something that I can't really ignore either.Other than that Nevermind is pretty good.

{"text": "This album is, simply genius. I always found it an intriging task to diagnose and analyse great masterpieces such as this, so I'll just start it off by simply saying that KURT IS GOD! or at least buddha. The whole \"Oh look at me, I'm depressed and suicidal and hate the world\" stereotype has been worn out so many times since Nirvana but Kurt truly was the epitomy of a sad, sad, sad man. This album perfectly resonates his depression, though not as effectively as his equally brilliant In utero. However, what makes this album so good is that rather confronting his sadness hard on like on In Utero, Kurt sort of does it in a tongue-in-cheek, \"meh, I hate myself, oh well\" style, which is a rather unique approach to depressive songs. this is mostly what makes Nevermind Nevermind. The first two tracks alone, SMLT and In Bloom alone, are the only two songs one needs to describe the generation this album was born of. Smells Like Teen Spirit is, as we all know, an immortal, thrashing, rock and roller of a rock and roller, full of pained, angry vocals and some of the most vicious and sharp edged guitar, bass, and drums heard since, well, ever. in Bloom, on the other hand, is stoned, slow, and molten. You can see the visions of a stoned, immobile stoner teen sitting on his couch, dazing into the wall across, with a purple, shiny bong in hand. the rest is a rollicking and powerful alt rock/garage rock album, full of other great songs, such as the pop and punk (not pop/punk) influenced Drain You, my all time favorite Nirvana song. Lithium has a wondefully melancholy and sad verse, with a thrashing, almost insane chorus, and an even more insanity driven bridge and outro. Stay Away's a fine punk rocker of a song, polly's a deliciously dark and bleak acoustic number about a rape, On a Plain, flows in a soothingly strange way, and a whole bunch of other sounds abound here. As for the fine invloved; Kurt is a genius songwriter, and although not a virtuoso guitarist, nevertheless a really, really good one. Krist ain't a John Entwistle, but his marching, intoxicated bass provides perfect rhythm and bite. Dave is the closest the group gets to virtuoso status, with his heavily heavy, pounding, John Bonham gone punk rock drum style. And although some say that this album was overproduced (as well as the band members), think aboput it. If Nevermind had the same production qualities of In utero, it would lose most of its charm, a waltzing on the edges of mainstream and underground charm, and would make the album more dark than needed. All in all, a brilliant album by a brilliant group, Truly one of the greatest albums of all time.\n", "val": 0.03024439699947834}
{"text": "I'll start with the good side first, since I don't want the Nirvana fans to get [upset] run away so quickly. Nirvana came through to the public when music was in a slumped period sure, I'll give it that. It did have to haul in a new sound from lands of foggy obscurity. So the good side basically is it was a splash that influenced some much better music afterwards. Kurt had a pretty unfortunate life, and having limited chords and skills, he did well thanks to his own emotion, it's just it's not the kind of emotion I like to hear all the time. Cynically/Comically upbeat mixed with depressive isn't enough variety for me at least.My biggest problems with the album, for that reason, is more of a matter of personal preference. I'll say it again: Nirvana overall (not just this CD) seemed to be that the songs were one of two things: It was either depressive wallowing - trapped within memories, or it was pretty much a joke; teen concert party music, or shock-dementia.Yeah \"Teen Spirit\" pokes fun at mindless moshing teens.. he has ironic humor elsewhere sure, but joking around killed any chances of intensity for me, so I couldn't get into it. That kind of thing wasn't much of a revelation anyway; pretty obvious. He can bring out pain however, but that gets a bit repetitive after awhile. It feels like very fuzzy and unclear because of that.My favorite music just happens to be that which can bring new things to you, focused and powerful, such as the stuff produced by Tool. Maynard & Co could get outside of seeing life from one set of eyes in one piece of the world when they needed to, and could expand on things like religion, spirituality, faith, hope, sexual experience, and the false selves of fearful people.. they aren't tied down with confusion or personal pasts, and if you want you can be sent on a trip and flow through a CD one song to the next... Nevermind is like a bunch of singles. Many songs stand-alone (making them almost too radio/premovie-theatermusic/friendly), and his voice doesn't blend with the music.. not to mention the fact that the playing wasn't all that great as far as variance went, only a few chords as you've seen elsewhere. The singing has too much importance, and without it everything flops. I enjoy balance of the two, a fusion. (When it comes to getting out emotions rather than thought I can turn to A Perfect Circle.. Smashing Pumpkins...)So yeah... I guess I just poked into a type of music that isn't for me huh? I still deserve to vote though.\n", "val": 5.168523421161808e-05}

Twelve years ago when this album came out, it sent a shockwave across the musical landscape and helped set forward the grunge movement.  The massive success of the single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" catapaulted Nirvana to a never before imagined status; and ultimately helped set the stage of lead singer/songwriter Kurt Cobain's untimely demise.  All the hype that still surrounds this album aside, \"Nevermind\" is one heck of a rock record.  \"In Bloom\" and \"Come As You Are\" became instant rock radio classics, while other tracks like \"Lithium\", \"Polly\", \"Lounge Act\", and \"Something in the Way\" are nothing short of amazing pure unadulterated hard rock.

{"text": "Nevermind is Nirvana's best album along with In Utero, leaving one album left I suppose.  Smells Like Teen Spirit remains one hell of a song as with Come as you Are.  Soft songs like Something in the Way and Lounge Act also fill the void.  This is Nirvana's most pop-oriented album which is most likely why it sounds so fresh.  It is a typical Butch Vig recording.  This album, however, is limited to the guitar playing talents of Kurt Cobain, which is that of a seventeen year old high school drop-out.  The songs are completely simple and limited in song structure (which is why Cobain originally intented to name each of his albums Verse Chorus Verse).  After all, he is no Billy Corgan or Trent Reznor.  The album, though amazing the first few times around, grows boring and listless as musical maturity develops.  For the years we spend as angsty teenagers, however, this album is well worth listening to.  I suppose it only gets four stars because Nirvana's lack of technique would lead to the ultimate death of rock and the reign of emo and punk.  If you don't think Nirvana's popularity has led to the disappointing music of today, read his suicide note or his journals.  Kurt Cobain knew, afterall, his own limitations and how overrated he had become.\n", "val": 0.005720161367207766}

It does have some grunge highlights and standards (lithium, breed, in bloom), those are 3 of the songs that made grunge what is was, anger, passion, destruction, obssesion, good music, anyway if yo u are really interested in exploring the grunge sound, i would recommend, nirvana's in utero (which is way better than nevermind for me, because kurt really poured his heart out on his last record, and it does define grunge even more than nevermind), also check out some real grunge: mother love bone, pearl jam's album's TEN & V.S, Soundgarden's LOUDER THAN LOVE & BADMOTORFINGER and alice in chains DIRT.Anyway, NEVERMIND, will pass through the decades as one of theTop 10 essential records of all the times, without any doubt...\n", "val": 0.00019574454927351326}

Until 1991...There's a reason why this is listed as one of the most influential albums ever released. Sure, the music might sound simple at first listen, but listen harder. Kurt Cobain is pouring his heart and soul out in this recording (and all of his other ones) for everyone to hear. He was telling the tale of Generation X: the long-haired, moody, grungy teenagers who just stopped caring. And he described them to a T. Which could be why \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" sparked a revolution in 1991: people haven't heard anything like it before on mainstream radio, and were fascinated by the louder, angrier sounds they were hearing coming from their speakers.But nevermind that. (no pun intended) If you're an alternative music fan, you probably own this. If not, this album combines punk, alternative, grunge with great pop melodies that helped this album sell millions of copies. Every single song on here is good, there is no need to skip over any.

All these songs have the REAL high school experience written all over them. They sound a lot like America's answer to the Sex Pistols, only without the political posturing. The difference between these guys and the Pistols is that for some reason everyone loved these guys while the Pistols never made the charts where I'm from.

This is a good song, but I gave it 7 out of 10 because of how overplayed it is.IN BLOOM(9/10): One of the more slower songs on this album, but still is a good Nirvana song attacking macho males.COME AS YOU ARE(10/10): I fell in love with this song when I first heard it, and has a different sound to the usual Nirvana: Kurt Cobain uses less of the distortion pedal and more of tht flanger pedal.BREED(7/10): An ambassador for the punkier side of Nirvana, but the tune is pretty repetitive. Quite good lyrics though.LITHIUM(11/10): WOOHOO NOW LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY THIS SONG ROCKS AND BECAUSE OF THAT FACT I GOT INTO NIRVANA'S MUSIC I WOULD PICK THIS OVER SLTS ANY DAY.POLLY(6/10): An acoustic song, I like the lyrics but that's the only thing in the song I can standTERRITORIAL PISSINGS(10/10): The ultimate punk rock anthem.DRAIN YOU(3/10):No offence to anyone, but I skip this track everytime I listen to this CD. I gave it 3 because of the bit in the middle where it all goes quiet.LOUNGE ACT(5/10): Another track I skip. This song is moderatly slow, and sounds similar to 'Hairspray Queen' off 'Incestiside'.STAY AWAY(11/10): One of my 3 favourite Nirvana songs (The other two being 'Lithium ' and 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' off 'In Utero'). Anyway, this is the fastest Nirvana song off this CD.ON A PLAIN(9/10): This song is also on the 'Unplugged' CD, but this one is faster and has feedback at the beginning.SOMETHING IN THE WAY(10/10): This song is about Kurts youth, and is the slowest song on the CD.

{"text": "Many things have been said about Nirvana sophmore release Nevermind. Nevermind broke Nirvana into the mainstream and a certain kind of alternative music as well. Well I am not to preach what alternative music is however a lot of great acts that were around the time did not get any credit or sales even though their material was way better than this. So many great and original artist who still make excellent album recieved perhaps more attention for their works in the 1990's that they would have gotten before but indeed it seemed though this album seem to change face of rock n roll . Rock ( especially in the US) was about being angry, fast and depressing and many other bands that would perhaps make it big in other countries were not velcomed by American Listeners even though they are a lot more alternative then some of the acts that recieve the same stamp.However Nevermind has appeared in a lot of best of list around the years and many magazine rank it high as one of the greatest albums of all time. Is this album great. No. It is good but not great.The problem lies in the songwriting. The fact was that Kurt only knew few chords and riffs and managed to write bunch of songs with them. Many of his songs sound the same and are pratically the same but with different lyrics and different tone.The production is flawless however Butch vig who produced it did a very good job with about half of the tracks. Why do I say half well about 5 or 6 songs on this album are just noise. You can't hear what Kurt is singing about and they are very poorly played. The fact is that Butch probably found it very difficult to do something outstanding with these tracks and tried best as he could. The fact that he should have take notes from Steve Albini who recorded and kind of produced Nirvana's third album In Utero and just engineer and mix and skip making anything out of them except that.Nevermind contains however some good such like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, Polly, On A Plain but the rest is either bad or does not live up to the same qualities as the other songs. These songs are not raw but a plane bore. Perhaps the other members of the band should have helped by writing the other material sole without Kurt's help.The fact is that Nevermind seems like a half-finished album. When you skip these fillers you have 6 songs that are really good. I don't care what this album did for the music business we should look at albums for what they are. These are disc or Vinyl with music on them. If the music is not good the album isn't.To this date many hail Nevermind as one of the rock's greatest albums. It is a good album but certainly not one of rock's greatest achievement in music history and certainly not one of Seattle's grunge best album. The fact is that Kurt Copain was not just a singer-songwriter but he was like Madonna and others a new face in music that everyone wanted a piece of and he was prortrait to be cool and something new however he was not even close of being one of the greatest songwriters of his era he was just lucky.Also is that before his death this album had sold 5 million in the US. After his death it has sold 10 million copies in the US. Pearl Jam sold 11 million copies of their album Ten and nobody died from that band.Overall grade 6/10.\n", "val": 0.00012594157306011766}

Nirvana sound fantastic as individuals and as a group, from Dave Grohl's (now in foo fighters) incredibly good drumming (especially in Teen Spirit), Chris Novoselic's bass playing (best in lounge act) to the incredible talent of the now legendary Kurt Cobain, even 9 years after his death(he died on 04/04/94) he is still renowned to be the man that made rock popular again.The first track is by far the most famous rock song ever written, \"Smells like teen spirit\" has a ludicrously catchy chorus with a melodic intersection and a nice solo toward the end. The other singles such as \"Come as you are\" with its amazing base line and clever lyrics show another side to Nirvana as does \"Polly\" and \"something in the way\".Whereas Breed comes into its own with its fast pased riffs and catchy chorus. Other not so well known songs (which happen to be fantastic tracks) like \"lounge act\", \"stay away\" and \"territorial pissings\" are also essential with their fast pace and catchy chorus's.My personal favourite tracks are \"Teen Spirit\", \"Breed\", \"Territorial Pissings\", \"Drain You\", Lounge act, \"Stay away\",\"Lithium\" and \"On a Plain\". As you can tell i prefer the faster pased songs, although i do appreciate the softer songs like \"polly\" and \"something in the way\". My personal favourites add up to 8 songs on a 12 song cd.

It was art.  ANd that's exactly what Nirvana as a band, Kurt Cobain as a lyricist, and \"Nevermind\" as an album are; pure art. Dirty, confusing, emotional, and true.Even today \"In Bloom\" sounds purer than near anything that was made ten years before it, anything today (ten years later), and I'm willing to bet, anything 10 years down the road.  \"Polly\" is as smearing and perplexing as a \"ballad\" should be.  And \"Something in the Way\" is as beautiful as it is esoteric.

{"text": "I fully expect a 0/50 helpful vote score.When Nevermind was released back in 1991, its popularity stemmed not so much from the quality of its music as how different it was from a lot of what MTV was playing at the time. It was not Poison, Paula Abduhl, or New Kids On The Block, but rather a totally different style of rock music. Since Nirvana seemed to be one of the few bands of the time period that didn't care much about image or looks, they were automatically hailed as these modern rock saviors and to this day are considered one of the greatest rock bands of the nineties.Unfortunately, time did not treat the album too kindly as pretty much every mainstream rock band from Bush to Blink-182 owes at least a little to the album's sound. And the fact of the matter is that when you look past the lack of make-up and hairspray, Nevermind is not that great an album.Part of its problem has to do with the lyrics themselves. Kurt Cobain's lyrics were often very incoherant and almost randomly generated. This is just as well because most of them were just his whining about how horrible society treated him in the past. The song structures weren't much better with a lot of oversimplified riffs, merely adequate drumming, and all around lack of originality. That's not to say there aren't a few high-points. In Bloom and Drain You are admittedly fun surf-rock songs, but two good songs out a total of twelve just doesn't cut the mustard when better albums like Alice in Chains' Facelift offer consistantly good music.In brief, I simply can't recommend this album to anybody other than fans of modern alternative music. And even that is a bit hard for me since most probably already own it. But if you're looking for a good album from the grunge era, pick up AIC's Dirt or Facelift instead.

(Compare this album to 93's Vs (Pearl Jam) No contest.) but it's impossible to dodge around the fact: Nirvana was one of Rock's most important bands. the formula seems to be to mumble through your depressing lyrics (good job dodging parental advisory) but at the same time yell them really loud.

However, the band did a good job hiding and for every song on the CD there is no singing required, just the afore mentioned mutters and screeches.  The instruments are great.  Despite his vocal lackings, Kurt is a zen master of his instrument, and Dave Grohl just can't play anything bad (which also raises the question why they didn't let him take up vocals every so often) and Novelisk never slows up the bass lines.Nevermind is by no means a bad album, It's really quite good, but since its orginal explosion, its' ripples have superceeded the splash.\n", "val": 0.01667468622326851}

We need a Cobain now because rock will dissapear soon, we need someone that changes all the parameters and doesn't follow any orders from the disc companies or MTV, someone who is a talented songwriter. Is a damn shame that during all these time, since 94, there haven't been a single great rock band in America like Nirvana.\n", "val": 0.00048655577120371163}

You can't deny though, that it did change things in the industry.  Nirvana had something other bands didn't.  I really can't say what it was though.

I just don't get why so many people seem to feel obligated to praise it.  Most of the stuff on this album strikes me as little more than boring noise.  Take \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" or \"Lithium,\" both of which have somehow been elevated to classic status by the general public while I wasn't looking.  Mopey, monotone vocals in the verses, pointless yelling in the choruses, extremely uninteresting arrangements and song structures...what's so great about these songs?  What am I missing?  In the past decade I've heard SO many bands that exhibited higher levels of musicanship and songwriting ability than Nirvana that it would be pointless to list them here.  Sure, Nirvana changed the face of radio, but since radio was spinning hair bands before grunge came along, what's that tell you?  Nirvana weren't even the best of the grunge trend, for Pete's sake.  Pretty much every song on Alice In Chains's \"Dirt\" and Soundgarden's \"Badmotorfinger\" and \"Superunknown\" is more creative and interesting than anything on \"Nevermind.\"  I think those who have read my reviews (and I know there are a few of you out there) know that I try really hard to be fairminded, but I just can't see the reason for the relentless praise of Nirvana.  This album gets two stars from me mainly because Dave Grohl is a great drummer, and Kurt Cobain did come up with a few halfway decent riffs.

Some say this album is depressing and you know they're right but it's also rebellous,scary,funny,sad, and dumb. But whatever it is it's always Kurt. When i listen to this album i can't make a judgement whether it's good or bad because i'm too busy relating to it. now let me meat the review requirements-- this album contains harsh yet sometimes smooth tones that lay a top a bed of slow and fast rythmes. Sometimes Kurdt will hit the guitar hard sometimes softly. Most of the time Kurdt sings sometimes others will harmonize.

I could talk about the influence it had on the bands that followed, but I've been beaten to it. I could tell you that this music hit people like me who were in their teens or twenties back in the early '90's so hard that most of us haven't recovered yet, but you already know that.What I can say is that I hadn't heard this album in about 8 years, after I lost my LP copy.  At the end of last year I got around to replacing it with the CD issue.  What surprised me was that 12 years on this material has not aged or become stale with time, but it's as fresh and vivid as it was back in the wild days of '91.  The honesty of the music and the true belief of the band shine through on track after track.  Nevermind must now be regarded as one of rocks finest moments; maybe it's last great fling before old age and the disease of corporate interference set in.Some will tell you that \"In Utero\" is Nirvana at their best, but as great as that album was, Nevermind is pure Nirvana before the fame, money and chemicals clouded their vision.

{"text": "What is there to say about Nirvana's now classic Nevermind? Almost 13 years after it originally came out, it's still going strong taking more space in your local CD store than the new releases of many other bands.If you're reading this and thinking of getting into Nirvana yourself, then don't listen to what the naysayers are saying. The truth is that seemingly many of them have only the slightest clue of what they're thinking about. Cobain's death or otherwise, anything that's stayed this good for more than a decade must have something to it.Many of these people's arguements just show how uninformed or illogical they are. Cobain has a harsh voice? Since when did you have to be a quire boy to do rock and roll? I know of a fellow named Bob Dylan who's not exactly the best singer in the world. And since when was Nevermind full of obsceneties? Last time I checked it had 5 at most, and the only one that was clear was when Cobain claims, \"nature is a whore\" on \"In Bloom\".And what about the meanings of these songs? At first glimpse, Nevermind's lyrics seem to make no sense at all? Mosquitos? You gotta be kidding me!But if one would take a little time and think a little differently about what Cobain was trying to say, they'd find that Cobain often used complex metaphors in Nirvana's songs.Either way, whether you're more inclined to believe the critics or the supporters, Nevermind changed the face of rock & roll for better or for worse and was a monumental album that should be in anybody's cd case of \"essentials\".When you first push the play button, in a matter of seconds you'll hear the now classic introduction to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", right before the instruments all-together explode. Soon after, the storm of the introduction calms and Cobain's voice comes through. \"Load up on guns and bring your friends, it's fun to lose and to pretend\" he states as he starts up the song that is to attack the apathy of his own generation through a double metaphor of going to a party. And soon afer that, the memorable chorus comes up. \"I feel stupid, and contagious\" and \"A mosquito, my libido\", the perplexing words are actually references to STD's and the early 90's careless attitude towards them.This continues for about 5 minutes by which time you'll be suree to be screaming alongside Cobain as he shouts \"a denial!\" several times in reference to the chorus to end the song.But no time to rest. Up comes \"In Bloom\", Nirvana's message to all those who claim to be fans of their music because it's the cool thing to do, but don't understand any of it. This is one of many of Cobain's attacks on the stereotypical \"macho man\".The other big song, \"come as you are\" comes next, as Cobain sings of numerous contradictions, and our mindset of wanting to change things for the better, but not acting out our thoughts.In bloom is the worst out of the big 5, but it's still great compared to the rest of the garbage that was popular before Nevermind. However, you might be tempted to skip the track in order to get to what many consider the real highlight of the album.\"Lithium\" is an amazing song about going insane with great lyrics, and a simply fantastic chorus. Clocking in at about 4 minutes, you'll have plenty time to enjoy it.The next track, Polly, is one of those songs you can't really appreciate until you know the story behind it. In 1991, a 14-year-old girl was kidnapped, raped, and killed in the Seattle area. Polly, is Cobain's metaphor for the girl. A very sad song with a great acoustic guitar, once you understand it it will become one of the highlight tracks on Nevermind.Territorial Pissings is the most punk-like of all the tracks here. As one reviewer said, 'classic punk melt-down', about as fast and heavy as punk will get.Drain You is Nevermind's great Love Song. With a great opening (One baby said to another, I'm lucky to have met you), the only complaint I have about it is the highly medical secondary theme that might confuse those trying to figure out what Cobain's talking about.Lounge-Act, is a great, and I believe, very under-rated song about ego-maniacs.Stay Away, is as the title suggests a song about getting away,but once doing so, regretting it.On A Plain might be the worst song on the CD but it's still very good. No real theme but a number of nice quotes. Sort of like a closing to the main part of the album.Nevermind finally closes up with Something In The Way, a song about 3-year-old Cobain running away from his parents and hiding under a bridge. A very slow song that some feel goes on for too long, one can argue that it's appropriate for a song ending a relatively fast album otherwise.So there you go. If you already have it, good for you. If not, go get it as soon as possible. This is an essential for any fan of modern rock. These guys in some way inspired many of these current-day bands, including \"The Vines\" among others.Check it out. Chances are 99/100 that you'll love it too.\n", "val": 0.00016437112935818732}

Much more so than Pearl Jam's \"Ten\", Nevermind has influenced all kinds of music from bands like the Smashing Pumpkins to Greenday, while producing the most original and influential energy since Jimi Hendrix. This trio from Aberdeen, WA was on the verge of something that nobody had accomplished since the Beatles, and Kurt's untimely death decelerated grunges popularity after albums like Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness died down. These are the masters of an art lead by the greatest songwriter of our time. R.I.P. Kurt Cobain.  Track Analysis1)Smells Like Teen Spirit: 10/10This is the anthem of the 90's, the song that started it all for Nirvana and grunge. A power lick that never gets old, not to mention great lyrics.2)In Bloom: 9/10Great ideas behind this one but I have to admitt it does get a bit old after you've listened to it over and over and over...3)Come as You are: 10/10A feel like nothing else Nirvana ever did. Sort of a sad happy combo with Kurt Cobain patented lyrics. Amazing.4)Breed: 9/10Extreme riff that is stronger than anything else on the record. Also can get a bit old, but great all the same.5)Lithium: 15/10The greatest song on the face of the Earth. Exceeds all, with the best lyrics ever written. The experience of listening to this song is inexplicable, it reaches to places nothing ever has and nothing ever will. \"I'm so happy, cause today I've found my friends, they're in my head...\"6)Polly: 10/10Their first of two antirape songs, a beautiful and horrifying acoustic riff that is more powerful than any of the screaming  guitar riffs and 2nd on the album.7)Territorial Pissings: 9/10\"Just because you're paranoid...\" Need I say more?8)Drain you: 10/10Brilliance in a Kurt Cobain form. A solid song that represents this album very well, powerful, gross, Nirvana.9)Lounge Act: 10/10Very underrated in it's field, could have been a classic for any other band. This record is so packed full of the best music on the planet we don't stop and appreciate songs like this one.10)Stay away: 10/10Ditto11)On a Plain: 9.5/10A different feel but still very Nirvana. This is the kind of song that you would expect if Nirvana slowed down a bit.12)Something in the Way: 10/10Inexplicably powerful, even more than Polly. Something you have to experience to understand.

{"text": "Let's get a few things straight here folks: Nirvana was not the best band on the planet (Kurt would've told you that himself), and Nevermind is not their best work. In Utero blows this entire album away in depth, and the raw, honest Steve Albini production on In Utero overshadows the overly slick Butch Vig production of this album.The song structures borrowed considerably from a long-overlooked band, the Pixies. Kurt even said in interviews that Smells Like Teen Spirit swiped quite a bit from Debaser (off of the Pixies' second album Doolittle). In addition you can hear strains of other Seattle bands such as The Melvins and Mudhoney, and also the noisy rock of Sonic Youth.Also notable as a Nirvana influence is Killing Joke. In fact, the band was sued for nicking the riff of Killing Joke's \"Eighties\" on Come As You Are.So, is Nevermind an entirely original recording? No. Is it an important album, though? Yes! Before Nevermind: Michael Jackson, MC Hammer, Madonna, Bon Jovi. After Nevermind: Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins. Nevermind was instrumental in bringing alternative rock to mainstream acceptance. It also resulted in the pallid state of today's commericial radio with bands like Staind, Nickelback, Bush, and Puddle Of Mudd, so let's take that claim with a grain of salt.As for the music? There are the obvious hits like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, Come As You Are, and In Bloom, but also some decent songs that avoided the mainstream radar (Polly, Something In The Way, On A Plain, Territorial Pissings). Overall though, Nevermind isn't as strong as Pearl Jam's Ten or Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger, which were both released in the same year.If you think that Nevermind is the only essential Nirvana release, I advise you to go out and buy In Utero--this is the only studio album that does Nirvana justice. Follow that up with Unplugged In NY and Insecticide. Also, you should strongly consider two Pixies albums: Surfer Rosa and Doolittle.\n", "val": 0.00011211179662495852}

In the 11 years that has passed, we've seen millions of bands come and go trying to rip off Nirvana, and this album. But, I think it can be safely said that none have come close to perfecting the elusive formula of hurt, poetic words , a thunderous rhythm section, and the remarkably melodic guitar chords. They may have made another amazing album (In Utero), turned in a stellar performance with acoustic guitars (MTV Unplugged) , but Nirvana are defined by, and shall continue to be, defined by this album.  And not without reason. This was exactly what Nirvana were about. Mixing their raw, punky power-chords, with pop sensibilities. And who's to argue it was the latter quality that made them famous, and introduced alternative rock to Madonna and Michael Jackson listening kids, replacing their spandex clothes with spendthrift flannel? The album defined the whole 90's alternative scene, and it's influence remains with us today. (The Vines, anyone?)  The record starts with the most famous Nirvana song, Smells Like Teen Spirit. In retrospect, it's easy to see why this song became the grunge anthem of the early 90's. A simple clean guitar figure, then Dave Grohl sends the song into overdrive with perhaps one of the most famous tom-tom rolls in history. The song contains brilliant use of the stop-start dynamics that Nirvana made their own, and Kurt Cobain's ironically witty lyrics (\"Load up on guns/Bring your Friends/It's fun to lose/To pretend\"). The song ends with Cobain screaming 'A denial' repeatedly, and distortion dying out in the background, thus bringing an end to one of the most celebrated songs of the decade. We aren't given a respite, however. The melodic chords of \"In Bloom\" start up soon after. With it's sing-a-long chorus (a stroke of genius if you know what the song is about), and the noisy (yet effective guitar solo), the song is a standout in an album of standouts. The murky bass lines of 'Come As You Are' start up soon after, as Cobain sings a story of alienation. Curious guitar effects decorate the chorus, and in a frustratingly confusing moment, the band steps a notch for the bridge, while Cobain sings \"And I swear that I don't have a gun.  It is a positively trandescent moment. The tempo ups slightly with the surging Breed. The song contains an inventive guitar figure, which remains in circulation for the entire song. Dave Grohl, who must surely win any contest for the most powerful drummer of the 90s, again proves why he is such an integral part of the band. Listening to it, you might think its a throwaway song, something of a tribute to the punk rock heroes that influenced the band. Looking up the lyrics, you find you were mistaken. They are clever, concise, and even funny. But thats Nirvana for you.  Lithium is next, and it stands as one of the finest songs the group ever cut.  A song about organized religion, youd never have found out by listening to it. With a delightfully ridiculous chorus of Yeaaahhhhhhh/Yeaaahhhh, yeaahhhh, yeah yeahh!, the song is another obvious standout. (Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, and Lithium. Some of the finest rock songs of the decade. All on one side of a CD. Sound like a masterpiece to you?). The tempo then takes a very sudden, and chilling dip, with the eerie Polly.  Its a nice hum-along song, but a very disconcerting feeling cant help but being noticed, and youll understand why when you read the lyrics. (The song is about the rape of a 14-year old girl).  You aren't left to mull over what youve just listened to however, as the zany intro to the punk rock throwaway \"Territorial Pissings\" starts up.  As the record draws to its end, you can see truly inspired songwriting in the final 20 minutes or so, with the extremely hummable On A Plain, and Kurt Cobains personal favorite, Drain You being the main highlights. The spurt of enthusiasm stops suddenly with the final track, Something in The Way. Consisting of 2 lone chords, and Cobains chilling vocals reciting a story of living under a bridge, the song brings an end to one of the most important albums of the decade. (Unless you have a version of the album that includes Endless, Nameless a hidden track consisting of a botched cut of Lithium)  Theres a reason why this album has been called a masterpiece. Its just 60 minutes of pure genius. You cant help but wonder how the alternative scene would be like without this album. Hair metal still going strong? Who knows. There may have been better albums, musically, than this in the grunge era (Alice In Chains Dirt comes to mind) , but no album defined the era, and captured the cultural consciousness of the public like this one.\n", "val": 0.029745515435934067}

{"text": "In the wake of the release of the travesty of a greatest-hits package, it becomes apparent how essential this album really is.  Everything about it - from the music, performances, sequencing of the songs, and the packaging - is just about as perfect as one could hope.Look at the songs that were left off the greatest hits package:1) BREED - As intense and corroded a riff as Cobain ever wrote, with lyrics documenting how much he doesn't care, but a performance proving how much he does.  A ... killer solo, too.2) POLLY - The first ballad/acoustic performance the band ever did, insuring that the harrowing lyrics would take precedent over the roar of guitars.  An unflinching account of a brutal rape, told form the viewpoint of the perpetrator.  No less than Bob Dylan praised this song and Cobain's courage to include it on the album.3) TERRITORIAL PISSINGS - Punk meltdown at its' funniest.4) DRAIN YOU - Some of Cobain's most clever lyrics - \"One baby to another says I'm lucky to have met you\", \"I don't care what you think unless it's about me\", etc.  Cobain had gone on to say that this was among his favorite compositions and was definitely as good if not better than Teen Spirit (I happen to disagree with this assessment, but it's still a great song).5) LOUNGE ACT - Not the best perfomrnace of the band's career, and a fairly pedestrian chord sequence in the first place, but some great lyrics as Cobain vents out how for as much as he'd like to be able to fit in, he could never let \"security\" smother the \"truth\".  In light of his future suicide, the lyrics prove poignant.6) STAY AWAY - Again, with lyrics like \"I don't know why I'd rather be dead than cool\", disturbing foreshadowing for future events.7) ON A PLAIN - One of my favorite songs on the album, and probably one of the druggiest bridges and melodies in punk.  (Ace lyric, \"I got so high, I scratched till I bled\")8) SOMETHING IN THE WAY - A haunting performance, terrifying in its' calm gentle surface and its' lost and twisted lyrics.  This song would perpetuate Cobian's claim that for a time he lived beneath a bridge after being kicked out of his home.  Like Polly, proof that the band did not have to rely on sheer volume to get intensity across.Throughout, Grohl's drumming proves how essential a great drummer is to any band, but especially one of Nirvana's caliber (the differecne between his drumming and Chad Channing on Bleach - I mean, different worlds.  Two totally seperate worlds.)  Butch Vig's production - though much maligned later by Cobain - brings the power of the band across in remarkable and innovative clarity.  Definitelty a different vibe from In Utero, but considering these songs are the poppiest in Cobain's catalog (you  can do the Monkey and the Hitchhiker to almost every song on this album!), more appropriate than the stark and raw Albini recorded later album.This is an important album to have: would you settle for a Beatles greatest hits that includes \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La Da\" or would you rather have the White Album?EXACTLY.\n", "val": 0.01207550335675478}

{"text": "Nevermind is easily one of the best rock albums of all time.  Its greatness and longevity is due not only to the catchiness of the songs, but the incredible power of the music, both sonically and emotionally.  Nirvana, in some ways, was a blues band.  Their music is an expression of psychic pain, so honest and direct that the listener feels an intimate connection with the band.  Nevermind is too amazing an album to skip over any songs, so I'm going to review each one.  The record kicks off with the mighty \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", a song so powerful that MTV and radio couldn't ignore it, even though it flew in the face of the pop-metal bands that dominated the charts.  SLTS is an explosion of pent-up rage and frustration, while at the same time a great pop song.  The visceral intensity comes to a climax with Kurt screaming the words \"a denial\" repeatedly at the top of his lungs.  The next track, \"In Bloom\", is a poppy song that follows the same soft/loud format of Teen Spirit.  The verses begin with Kurt wearily singing lyrics about decay and fertility.  The tension builds, and suddenly we're blind-sided by the instantly catchy chorus about a macho, gun-toting man who \"likes all the pretty songs\" and \"likes to sing along\" but \"knows not what it means.\"  Nevermind takes an unexpected turn with \"Come As You Are\", a softer, murky-sounding tune with exceptional lyrics and melodies.  The lyrics are a big mish-mash of contradictions, telling us to \"come doused in mud, soaked in bleach\" and \"as a friend, as a trend, as an old memoria.\"  The song's ethereal atmosphere reaches a breaking point in the bridge, one of the most transcendent moments on the album.  \"Breed\" picks up the pace a bit, and puts the focus back on rocking hard.  \"Breed\" doesnt follow the soft/loud dynamic, but its a great song nonetheless, an energetic punk song hinging on a monstrous riff.  \"Lithium\", although a top 40 hit, is probably the most bizarre song on the album.  The chord progression during the verses and choruses is quite odd, and contrapuntal to the vocal lines.  Despite this, the melodies are beautiful, and work perfectly, making it unforgettable.  Lyrically, the song is a 1st person account of a nervous breakdown.  However, the lyrics aren't overtly disturbing, but rather, pleasant and sometimes even uplifting.  \"Polly\" is Nevermind's first acoustic song.  The melodies slow and gentle, the vocals relaxed and draped in simple harmonies, at its surface \"Polly\" is a very peaceful song.  But somehow it gives a subtle feeling something isn't quite right, which perfectly underscores the song's lyrics.  The lyrics tell the story of a young girl being kidnapped and tortured and interestingly, they are sung from the offender's perspective.  The next tune, \"Territorial Pissings,\" is an all-out punk rock scream-fest.  It has 3 chords and only a handful of lyrics.  Yet even in the midst of all the punk angst, Kurt manages to get a nice little melody off in the verses.  As the song draws to the close, Kurt gives it all he's got, eventually reducing his voice to a strangled cough.  \"Drain You\" is arguably the most upbeat and positive song on the record.  The entire thing has a confident and triumphant feel to it, particularly the powerful, sing-along chorus.  \"Drain You\" is Kurt's interpretation of love, and the lyrics reflect on it from a romanticized view (\"With eyes so dilated I've become your pupil\") as well as a realistic one (\"Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth...\").  \"Drain You\" also features a nifty Zeppelin-like bridge.  Track number 9, \"Lounge Act\" is a classic, straightforward pop song, even though Kurt screams the last verse and chorus.  The title is somewhat fitting, since most of the song is laid back and chipper compared to most of Nirvana's material.  \"Stay Away\" opens with a punishing drum roll from Dave Grohl and then explodes into a dark and driving punk song, that nevertheless features the dynamic soft/loud format.  With its anthemic refrain, \"Stay Away\" rivals \"Territorial Pissings\" in punkish rage...\"On a Plain,\" which shares the same triumphant feeling of \"Drain You,\" is possibly the most well-constructed tune on Nevermind.  The verses begin with a somewhat dazed-sounding melody, suddenly interrupted by the brilliantly harmonized line, \"Love myself better than you,\" which gives way to a cathartic and catchy chorus.  \"On a Plain\" also has a magnificent bridge, which changes the mood and adds a new dimension to the song with a slower and dreamier melody it  Lyrically, \"On a Plain\" has many themes, each line profound and puzzling at the same time.\"Something in the Way,\" Nevermind's acoustic closer, is the simplest and arguably the most emotive song on the album.  It has three chords.  The verses are musically spare, and the way the lyrics are sung is breathtaking.  The chorus is adorned with simple harmonies and a lone cello, giving it a majestic atmosphere.  The lyrics, expressed through a metaphor homelessness, recount a period of Kurt's life when he was lonely and lost, and they instantly speak to the heart and soul of the listener.  These songs comprise Nevermind, an immaculate mixture of punk, pop, and hard rock that changed music when it came out and continues to inspire today.

Dave Grohl is one of the best drummers I've seen in a long while, Krist's bass made the band sound amazing subtly in the backround, and Kurt's screaming and chords made some of the most appealing songs ever.

Grade: A+Breed - One of those mosh pit songs that make you want to jump up and down. Nice work Kurt. Grade: A-Lithium - Maybe my favorite Nirvana song among all the favorite. Dangerously catchy, and lyrics go so deep you have to pay close attention to understand it all. The confusion, and Kurt playing around with the chords. Masterpiece.

Krist does a nice little skit in the beginning too. Grade: ADrain You - A happy song. This song is simple, but the movement, the chemistry, it's all shown here. The little intermission is nice, and when they break back into the song, you're just waiting for Kurt to sing just so you can sing with him. Grade: A+Lounge Act - This song starts off with something that just hurls you into the song. The bass line. This is one of my favorite bass lines, so much that I had to learn it on my guitar. Kurt gets crazy at the end of this song, but stays in rhythm. Grade: AStay Away - This is an anarchy song, where Kurt again lets it all hang out. He lets out some of his opinions in this, which I'm sure most of you anarchists will like and everyone else will think about. Grade: A-On A Plain - Another happy song, talks a bit about Kurt's dad and just some more of his views. Very deep, with a soft parts around the end where you will go pitch silent for. Grade: A+Something In The Way - What a way to end it! Of course, besides for the few of you that might have heard Endless, Nameless, which is great in its own sense. Kurt talks about the Bridge where the Muddy Banks of Wishkah are, which is the name of their 96 album. Very deep, very eery, very nice. Grade: A-You must purchase this album. This album completely changed rock, and it's not even my favorite Nirvana album!

There was no skintight spandex, no shiny leather, no feathered hair, no expensive sports cars, no drooling scantily-clad women, etc.  Instead, there were three average guys in blue jeans and regular shirts rocking harder and better than any 1980's glam-rock band could ever hope to achieve!  Songs such as \"Come as You Are\", \"Something in the Way\" and \"In Bloom\" spoke to the average people a lot more than hearing & watching the typical egocentric hair-band paryting in a hotel room.Too much of 1980's pop rock and glam-rock had become predictable and clich.  People needed to hear something different and Nirvana was one of the groups that walked into the spotlight forever changing the sound and shape of rock-and-roll forever!  Once Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" hit the streets (along with albums by Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins and other alternative rock bands), 1980's pop rock and glam-rock died in what seemed a only matter of months.Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" will forever be a powerful testament to rock's revolution against excess.

Regardless of how you feel about Nirvana, one thing is certain: Nevermind has been the subject of over-analyzation by music critics for years.You've heard the story millions of times. Nevermind came out at a time when music was in a very sorry state. The 90's had just begun and the world was trying to move away from all the hair-metal bands of the nineties that had become such a stale cliche (Much like the nu-metal bands of late). Indeed, Nevermind completely changed the story of music and paved the way for countless bands of the 90's to follow and started a style that today, still refuses to die. But everyone blabbers on about how thoughtful and insightful this album is and about how Kurt Cobain was this great poet. Nothing could be shorter of the truth. The true beauty behind Nevermind is in it's simplicity. People realized that you can just have great stripped down music without all the dramatics. Don't think for a minute I am diminising the quality of this album. I'm just simply saying, everyone loves it for all the wrong reasons. The bottom line is, good music is good music. If it sounds good, it is good, nothing more to it, and Nevermind is an album that confirms that.I think it is obvious that this album has and will continue to stand the test of time. I myself have bought 3 copies of it since it's release (My first cassette tape of it, a CD that got worn out, and the copy I now own). Pretty much 1 out of every 5 people in the country own this.

This album is HUGELY overrated and praised as the best album with the best guitar work ever - Kurt Cobain was definately NEVER a good guitarist. This album was way too polished by the record industry and made to look good - it didn't have the raw sound of In Utero that made In Utero great. However, Kurt was one of the best song writers ever, and not many can beat Kurt Cobain at that. Despite the bad guitar work, this is much better than some of the Nu-Metal you see out there these days and Blink 182 garbage - Kurt could spin circles at guitar compared to those guys. Some of the best songs are here are definately not the singles (Smells Like Teen Spirit is highly overrated and not their best) but the \"filler\" material such as Lounge Act. On A Plain, Territorial Pissings, and most of the songs at the end of the cd are good. Something in The Way is a very good exit track due to its calm and depressing manner.

That is just a disclaimer.What these people are missing is that Kurt Cobain was not at all concerned with the technical aspects of his music, he simply wanted to express his anger and pain.  I know this sounds cliche, but it is the truth.  And to those who say this is nothing but depressing, I'm sorry but everyone's life can't be filled with flowers and happy things (and the album is more of an uplifting rebellion than a downtrod depressing resignation anyway).I will not take the time to review each song, because that has been done enough already.

From there on, the record continues without a bad track, and you can't help but listen to the entire album. In Bloom is a masterpiece, and Breed is even better, with fast punk rock riffs and Kurt Cobain's legendary, urgent voice. Polly is one of the best songs I've ever heard, about a 14 year old girl that was raped in Aberdeen, WA. Being from Seattle I knew about the thing Cobain was writing about, and the lyrics kind of shook me. Territoreal Pissings is a classic punk rock song, fast passionate riffs with Cobain screaming with all his heart. The last track, Something In the Way, is one of the simplest but the most mesmerizing. The verse is mysterious, obscure, but somehow makes perfect sense. The guitars are simple, but more powerful than any riffs I've ever heard. This album kind of caught me in a trance, with its intensity and passion.

If you listen to the other grunge album from that Era or the bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden or Alice In Chains. they had something really important to say which was the goal that Kurt Cobain wanted to do but didn't reach to all the people except the teenyboppers and the young kids who buy Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park albums to day. They weren't the best musicians but they weren't terrible. And with the whole thing that Kurt was the man in the group and he was Nirvana is and was not true. He wrote all the songs for the Bleach album and In Utero album but on this one . Their most succesful and best produced album this album was their all. Kirk Novesellic and Dave Grohl gave all that they had on this album just like Kurt did. Even more as I see all the Interwievs that they did I think Novesellic was indeed the spokesman, the best composer and the best musician. I think this album is overrated and In Utero is much better but not for as widespread audience as Nevermind. Still Nevermind is good but not as good as you may think.

{"text": "The simple fact that hundreds of bands have tried to copy Nirvana - without success - shows its unique strength and resistance to become just another dump-and-wast-band. Because Nirvana is like a God, many try to overcome its master, but no one succeed. In their masterpiece and firework Nevermind, a sense of draining and xenophobia cracks through. It is almost how you can feel love-hate because of its anxiety and bitterness. But all this feelings that are put together in Nevermind are yet o.k. Why? Well, the rebellness and youth-overthrowing-the-system kind of tension - makes this record to a no ending road to paradise. To me.

{"text": "This is probably what everybody else wrote about this album if they loved it aswell. It's phenomenal! Although i have to admit that when i first bought it and stuck it in the stereo i didn't like it all that much. But the intro to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was the greatest sound that ever went through my ears. It kicks... I just listened to it over and over again. I couldn't get sick of it, and as soon as i got a guitar that ws the first thing i tried to play. And when i finally mastered it i felt like a god. Kurt Cobain proved to the all musicians that you don't have to play complicated to be great. Not to say that i don't respect Steve Vai (espcially \"The Audience is Listening\". It rocks!)Look at \"Rape Me\". It's one of his greatest songs and it basically consists of 4 chords, and the intro to \"Polly\", \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and so on. Just to set the record straight, InUtro is not as good as Nevermind and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is their best song. Oh yeah, i think Nirvana has the best unplugged album ever.

A nice, compassionate and troubled man who probably deserved more than what he got. Anyway, this disc is excellent and well known by many. It's dark, aggressive and somewhat trippy.

It's somewhat dark, yet haunting, melodic and simple. The hidden track (which I only recently found out was on 'certain' discs) is called \"Endless, Nameless.\" It starts at 13:51, and is mostly a noise rocker with de-tuned strings and destruction at the end.If anyone's interested in sampling an infinitely important and influential piece of what was considered \"grunge\", this album should be owned.\n", "val": 0.011138450354337692}

Nirvana came out when rock was plagued by long-winded, yet unnesesary solos that would killed the quality in the end.  It was no longer about the song itself.

{"text": "It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since Nevermind was released.  It's one of the albums I always have in my traveling CD pouch. Not long ago my son and I were talking about this fact-he asked my why I always had it with me in the car-and, after giving it some thought, I decided it was because the music so uniquely expresses a personality.  Cobain was charismatic-admittedly in a sort of unsavory way-and so is his music.  It has a power to truly connect creator to listener.The most common criticism of the album usually cites the lack of fully formed, mature musicality present on the album.  I fail to see the point.  The early Beatles weren't the musicians they later were; that fact in and of itself doesn't detract from the vitality and sincerety of the music in that case any more than it does here.  I was in Hong Kong last October and went and saw an exhibition of pottery form the earliest Chinese dynasties through today.  The really old stuff was simple and flawed-and far more powerful in presentation than some of the far more sophisticated recent pieces.  To be rudimentary is not necessarily to be meaningless.Clearly Nirvanna spoke to something fundamental in an extremely large audience.  Some of my son's friends are primarily C&W fans-yet all seem to own a copy of Nevermind.  Sometimes it's the message that's more important than the musicianship.  This is an instance of connection over craft.  You want guitar virtuosity?  Listen to Clapton.  Want to feel something?  Listen to Nevermind.\n", "val": 0.00597662478685379}

{"text": "Nirvana, most people view them as the Beatles of the 90's and they have good reason to, they created and led the genre of grunge to the masses. Back in the early 1990's most American teenagers were looking for a reason to not care, for a new sound to fuel their \"ignorance is bliss\" philosophy, and Nirvana answered the call. When \"Smells like teen spirit\" hit the airwaves it was a pure rush of adrenaline, something no one had ever heard before and it changed everything. Out with the 80's hair bands, in with the grunge heads and punk rockers, to this day one can not deny Nirvana's influence. Front man and legend Kurt Cobain became the modern day John Lennon, backed by incredible lyrical genius and a modest personality.But I suppose you have heard enough of my rambling, here is what you came for, the review of \"Nevermind\". Wow...what words can really describe it I can't seem to bring to mind right now, in all honesty though it is AMAZING. Even to this day Nirvana is held in the highest regards, many times being compared to groups like The Beatles, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Led Zeppelin. Many people have even had the nerve to call this album \"pop\"...Well if you are going to say that, you might as well call the Beatles long time pop icons instead of rock n' roll legends.

{"text": "Though there's no denying its cultural impact, this CD is highly overrated as a rock album, as Nirvana were overrated as a band and Kurt Cobain as a musician. While Nirvana are usually seen as the leaders of the Seattle grunge scene, they were not the best grunge band around; both Pearl Jam and Soundgarden (who also preceded them as the first band to come up with the grunge sound) were both more sophisticated in their playing and compositions. Instrumentally, Nirvana were very restricted, not only because of their challenging three-man lineup (with which some incredible things were done before - note Cream, the Police and Rush) but also because of the bandmates' limited instrumental abilities, most notably Kurt Cobain's powerful but very simplistic guitar (note his obvious, pointless solos especially). Dave Grohl's drumming is solid but banal. Bass player Chris Novoselic is the only member of the band with a recognizable playing style, but while his bass-lines are quite powerful and memorable they are also sometimes annoying.But Nirvana's biggest failing is also their biggest strenghth; the simplicity of their sound makes Nirvana's music extremely powerful, and what Kurt didn't have as a musician he made up for in charisma and showmanship. Cobain's weary, angry, nasal voice was the voice of a generation, and it put into words the feelings of that generation. That's what made Smells Like Teen Spirit such a huge hit, and so important and groundbreaking. It's beacause of Kurt's personality that Nirvana had a much bigger following than Soundgarden could have ever had. It's their simplicity and straightforwardness that was groundbreaking and turned this album into a classic.Listening now, ten years later, it's difficult to be impressed by Nirvana's original sound, since it was copied so many times before; and when appreciated in a vacuum, as a music album and not in its historical context, it's really not that breathtaking, certainly not as good as Ten or Superunknown. As good as Smells Like Teen Spirit is (and it is, it really is), some of the other songs sound a bit too much like it, and the whole thing becomes a bit dull after a while. I rarely listen to the entire CD from beginning to end; there are several songs on the album which are truly excellent, my favorites being, besides Smells Like Teen Spirit and the equally good Lithium (I just love the bass here), In Bloom (Kurt's only great guitar solo), Something In The Way (the beautiful cello sound adds a lot), On A Plain (note the beautiful ending, as everything fades out except for the backing vocals) and the bone-chilling minimalistic Polly, a frightfuly effective song. Several other songs, though, I find skippable, namely Come As You Are (boring, obvious, overrated, annoying bass-line), Territorial Pissings (noise) and Drain You (just plain boring).In case I haven't made myself clear, I don't think Nirvana were a bad group. Nevermind is an extremely powerful album, even if not as it was ten years ago. It's obviously an absolute essential in every well-balanced collection, if not as a rock album then as a cultural artifact. It should be on your shelf even if you won't listen to it more than once. But try an album by another grunge album (I recommend Pearl Jam's 'Ten') because grunge made some good music, and it doesn't all come down to Smells Like Teen Spirit. If you want to hear Nirvana at their musical best, though, try their MTV unplugged live show (Kurt shows surprisingly good control of an acoustic guitar, even if not as inspiring as that of a master like Clapton), which shows a  softer, more sombre, more mature Nirvana, and also includes their versions of selected classics (most notably their excellent version of Bowie's 'Man Who Sold The World') and not only Cobain songs, which tend to get boring after a while. Still, for the phenomena that is Nirvana, Nevermind is the no. 1 essential.\n", "val": 0.0009469068609178066}

Born out of a time of extreme disaffection among the youth of America, Nirvana blasted away at the gnawing insignificance of many aspects of modern life. Underneath the screeching is a yearning for more, for something real, for an escape from the numbing nature of life in the 90s. Unfortunately, in Cobain's and countless others' cases, that desire for an escape led to his tragic suicide. He could not break out of the box, and this CD, especially Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come As You Are, remain a testament and a landmark to that time.Musically and lyrically, this CD does have some weaknesses, which keep it from 5 stars in my book, but for their sheer emotional power, it ranks right up there, especially now, given the pointless death of Cobain.Whenever I listen to this it's like a memory of another age and another time, but too often, it still speaks for too many in our society.Peace.\n", "val": 0.01910725049674511}

{"text": "Who among us will forget those immortal words, or where we were when we first heard them?  Nirvana is a band that has forever changed how I look at the world.  They are almost solely responsible for the Seattle grunge scene, and for that I am grateful.  I was very proud to say this band resided in my hometown, and being in the middle of the whole grunge thing was a feeling I'll never forget.  When I first heard that Kurt had taken his life, I hoped beyond all hope it was not true.  This was (to the people of Seattle anyway) an event almost as earth-shattering as Pearl Harbor.  A lot was lost when this man died.  Anyway, this album has much to offer, from hard rock (\"In Bloom\") to softer stuff (\"Something in the Way\") to punk (\"Breed\"), and never misses a step.  It may not be that technical, but that doesn't stop millions of people (including myself) from considering it a masterpiece.  \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" will always be one of my favorite songs.  Just hearing it almost brings me to tears, in memory of the good old days.  I cannot describe what this album means to me.  There is nothing else like it.

{"text": "Though there were bands that were as good (if not better) that preceded them on the Seattle alt-rock scene, let's face it, Nirvana brought alt-rock out of the underground and into the mainstream.  Before Nirvana, alt-rock was tucked in to the bowels of the Seattle underground and college campuses.  Nirvana begat a music revolution from which I'm still recovering.I've often been accused of overstating the case, but this album gave a voice to a generation that at the time was struggling to find its identity.  It gave generation of people looking for something to hold onto and call its own just that.Kurt Cobain's life mirrored his art.  He was gone a very short time later and (as is its wont) the music scene shifted away from alt-rock.  Though it tried its best to hang on, alt-rock just wasn't the same without its reluctant leader.This album sums it all up.  It's first single, the driving \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", is full of angst, screaming about a world that is boring and useless to the teen spirit it speaks to.  \"Come As You Are,\" \"Lithium,\" \"Breed,\" and \"On A Plain\" all serve to further drive home the point.  The point is that we are a generation, not bound to the ideals of our parents and their parents, but free to determine our own path and fate.  And we are here to deal with the consequences as they come.This is a must for anyone between the ages of 22-31.  True 1990's genius.\n", "val": 0.005977300461381674}

In Utero is the real Nirvana, with excellent songwriting and a more garage-feel. Polly was good, but when they followed it up with Rape Me they created the perfect anti-rape anthem. Something In the Way is the best song on the cd, as it shows Kurt Cobain's life behind the mask.

The majority of songs are, ultimately, quite average, in particular Drain You, Stay Away and Lounge Act.However, I can't deny that i love Come As You Are's mellow tunefulness and Kurt's Beavis and Butthead voice ('soooooooaaaaaakkkkkkked in bleach' haha). Smells Like Teen Spirit perfectly captured the grunge feeling of the time, yet commercialised it just enough to open it up to the masses, whether that was a good thing or a bad thing. I also like On A Plain for some reason.Overall, whilst this is a good album to have, i wouldn't say it is as amazing as most people seem to think. Maybe at the time, early nineties and all that, it worked, because it was vaguely new, refreshing and different. But 10 years later its just not happening for me.I mean look at the opening lyrics to In Utero...'teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old...'.

{"text": "While many argue that Nevermind is either overrated or underrated, I find it to be both.It's overrated since I disagree with many calling it the greatest album of all-time or the greatest alt-rock album ever. It's not the greatest album ever or even the greatest alt-rock album. Albums like the Pixies' Doolittle, R.E.M.'s Murmur, The Clash's London Calling, and Pavement's Slanted And Enchanted are all better rock albums than Nevermind. Why VH1 called it the second greatest album of rock & roll is a mystery to me.However, Nevermind is underrated since many seem to ignore how talented and great Nirvana was. Yeah, they sold millions of records and broke into the mainstream, but they never sold out or changed their sound to become popular. I seriously doubt they wanted to become as big as they did. They did not \"rip-off\" the Pixies, Husker Du, or Sonic Youth. Rather, they took those influences and created a sound that was their own. There is not one weak track on Nevermind. \"Something In The Way,\" \"Come As You Are,\" \"In Bloom,\" \"Drain You,\" etc. are all great, brilliant songs. The only thing that might take away from the album is that fact that their singles (\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" \"Lithium,\" \"Come As You Are,\" and \"In Bloom\") were seriously overplayed on MTV and radio. But is that Nirvana's fault? Nope.Nevermind is a very, very, very good album. It deserves a listen from rock fans everywhere. It is one of those albums where you won't skip any tracks.

However, the album does not reach a crescendo, in my opinion, until the second half in which the two best songs (\"Drain You\" and \"On A Plain\") lie.  Part of this album's brilliance, however, was its ability to gain praise from the critics and public alike.  Very few bands are able to do this.  The critics, more often than not, get it right.  They can identify the good bands from the poor (i.e. the dire music we hear in the charts which the general public like).

At the time I didn't understand why I liked them so much, but now I do.  These are some of the most brilliantly crafted melodies and harmonies to ever grace a rock record.  This is in fact why the album is so innovative for its time.  It proved that hard, punk-like, angst-filled music could be melodic and accessible.  It made grunge a not only respectable type of music, but popular as well.  This is why people identify w/ it so well.  The lyrics are filled w/ angst and despair, but the songs can be sung in the shower.  In other words, Nirvana is essentially, The Beatles of 90's rock.  All right, enough critic-talk, let's discuss why I personal like this cd.  Basically, I just like the music.  It's gripping, catchy, and extremely addictive.  I could listen to these songs over and over (which I find myself doing sometimes) and never get bored or annoyed w/ them.  Currently, \"Drain You\" and \"On a Plain\" catch my ear.  They have some great harmonic work and brilliant chord progressions.  As for the lyrics, I can't really say I personally identify w/ them just b/c I'm generally a pretty carefree, happy-go-lucky kind of person (also, I'm out of my rebellious teen stage).  However, I can understand how a young teen would identify w/ Cobain's lyrics.  Kurt seems to speak for the youth w/ his haunting words of confusion, anger, and despair.  This doesn't mean I agree w/ him, b/c I believe that if you have Jesus Christ in your heart, then you have no reason to be angry, but I can sympathize.

{"text": "The Last Great Rock album, by the Last Great Rock Band, NEVER MIND opens with the Last Great Rock Single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\"  It is a moment that changed the sound of popular music as surely as SGT PEPPER or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON or THRILLER did, and it's effect on pop culture, now going on 10 years, has been as lasting as it's predecessors.Kurt Cobain was a great guitar player, a great song writer, and a fantastic singer, but his true genius was finding a way to blend the previously untamed punk/grunge sound he heard all around him with a Pop format.  The result, found most purely on NEVER MIND, was a hybrid more powerful and energetic than anything since LONDON CALLING, more than a decade earlier.Cobain's curse, of course, was obsessive self-criticism and self-doubt.  What other cerebral rocker would have written (and sung at length) \"I think I'm dumb\"?  He wasn't dumb, not by a long shot, and I mark his death as the end of Rock.This is a stunning album, from start to finish.  The decade past and the imitators that have filled it haven't dated this LP; their short-falling attempts only prove what a massive force Nirvana was.Listen to \"Come As You Are\" and try to think of anything on it--a single word, a single note--that you could change to improve it.  Listen to \"Breed\" and try to come up with a more energetic sound you've heard lately that wasn't a thinly-veiled copy of this very record.Most of all, listen to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\"  If there has been a better explanation of what it is to be young and cornered recorded in the last 20 years, I haven't heard it.\n", "val": 0.014081697911024094}

Instead of the sludgy heavy production that greeted thier muisic with Bleach, this was lighter, crisper, cleaner and generally more radio-friendly. Some of the songs are excellent, but if this album had the production of Bleach, it would have been amazing. Many people rave about this album, whilst some people (even hardened Nirvana fans) moan about how it is thier least favourite album.At first I loved it. Now I can't even remember the last time I listened to it. Just listen to the live version of Smell Like Teen Spirit - it's a million times better and contained all the angst, aggression and sheer energy that this album should've had. At the end of the day, this \"classic rock album\" fails to stike a chord with the people it REALLY should, and those people are a large amount of true Nirvana fans worldwide.Lastly Cobain was not a genius.... Almost all of his songs had the same structures and the lryics don't mean anything most of the time (something else HE said in an interview).  If Nirvana didn't have so much commercial appeal and he didn't kill himself then they wouldn't be anymore popular than most other grunge bands.

Smells Like Teen Spirit, the biggest hit, does not define this album. Smells Like Teen Spirit is a great rock song/anthem though and one of my favorites on the disc. In Bloom rocks out and is good but gets old if you listen to it too much. Come As You Are is a hauntingly beautiful song that blends rock and melody together in a unique way (it's also very dark). Breed is an electronic beatdown of a rock song that makes you clench your teeth and jump up and down. Lithium is one of the biggest winners on the disc because it has so much originality and a great rhythm and melody. Plus it's lyrics are very prepared and ready to end (it was about a man finding god before commiting suicide). Polly is a beautiful song that sounds like Kurt is about to cry or as if he is sad. Territorial Pissings is a punk song at heart that makes you want to thrash. Drain You is a wonderful love song with graphic lyrics that is an all around perfect formula. Lounge Act is filled with angst and love all at once and turns into a very good ballad. Stay Away is very hard and has catchy lyrics with a great guitar line. On A Plain is another great ballad with kind of nonsense lyrics that sound cool. It's kind of mediocre in a sense but I still think it's good. Something In The Way is yet another ballad about living under a bridge (Kurt lived under a bridge for short amounts of time). It also sounds like Kurt is close to tears. That's what's great about this album and In Utero. There is so much emotion and heart in it that you'll never get sick of it. There's a song for every mood. This is and will always be the best album ever created in my mind and in my heart. Buy this and In Utero and I guarantee satisfaction. Thank you, god bless.\n", "val": 0.03140857070684433}

{"text": "About 4 years ago now I was at a crossroads in my life. I was purched between being popular or an outcast. Both groups had offered there best to me. I sat on the middle of the fence for a long time before, mmmmm maybe about 5 years.6 years earlier as an 11 year old i heard a relativley well known song called \"Smell Like TeeN Spirit\" and over the years had re-heard it whether it was through radio or t.v. I always met this with the same reaction \"thats a f-in good song\". That was greated with the same response around the room.My brother had always been a guitarist and i wa always around rock music but never showed any interest. My best friend listened to madonna had that was an influence in me wanting out of mainstream. Never though had I had an interest. I could even be quoted as saying I hated Music.But I had been developing an apreciation for it and decided I wanted to hear that song at will so I borrowed the cd \"NEVERMIND\" from one of my friends on the sole  purpose of hearing Smells Like Teen Spirit, it was and is really that good.I poped the cd in and those infamous opening bars played to the tune of the soul. Then for the first time ever I heard the other songs to nevermind and my life was changed. I fell completeley over one side of the fence.Smells Like Teen Spirit- One of the greatest riffs of all. So much energy and it staysin your head forever.In Bloom- Their best pop song. His voice singing \"hes the one\" and dave grohls fills a stand out.Come as U ARE- A masterpiece, truly one of the greatest songs of all time, often overlooked. The hook of the song falls comepletely backwards to the best guitar solo i have heard. So much heart.Breed- This is the first song that is really pacey through out and is a stand out in the groups playing. for those of us who love to \"BREED\"Lithium- lyricaly my fav song. Musically so catchy is noveselics bass line that all who have ever felt sad wil feel something here.Polly- Acoustic makes it present felt, but no ordinary acoustic. This a drumed sound and really is amazing to listen to.Territorial pissings- This really the only punk song on here. Discusses alienation which i can solece to.Drain You- My favorite nirvana song and kurts to. This is plainly about love and you never get tired of hearing it or singing those \"infectious lyrics\".Lounge Act- great little number. I was going through a bust upo a tthe time and this helped me relize that \"ive got this friend u see, who makes me feel\"Stay Away- This is really a song that could made its place on any of their albums. It has a realy gruff sound and a sound they rearely performed.On a Plain- This although a bunch of petry lines thrown together is my biggest realtion to Kurt. It really reflectsa a bad life .Something in the way- mmmmmmmmm, yeah a terriffic song. A really magnificent atmosphere.I now love music as the best thiong in my life. So thats how powerful this record is I now play guitar and write songs.  This album helped me through my life and its baddest point and still helps me today when i fell down.If u aren't quite sure of where u stand By this.Brilliant- something special in our history.\n", "val": 0.009484595619142056}
{"text": "I will start this review by saying that this album has the best cover ever.  Before even popping this in you already get an idea of what Nirvana is all about - honestly subversive towards conventional American ideas (the \"dung heap of conformity\" as Cobain put it) but not without humor (baby penis!).When Nevermind went to #1 on the charts it not only ended the careers of many manufactured pop \"artists\", it also made \"alternative\" a huge marketing tool (and now it's generally the way people refer to rock music).  Even though it started a decade earlier with The Smiths' self-title and REM's \"Murmur\", it finally became cool because Nirvana put it in a very accessible form.  Nevermind was everything that was missing from music for decades - fun but not contrived pop (\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"), rebellion (\"God is gay/Burn the flag\"), and even a lead singer that was easy to relate to and intelligent but also mysterious and confusing.Borrowing from the Pixies start-then-stop structures, Black Sabbath's grungy riffs, and a Ramones facade, Nirvana put together this album that has inspired countless bands, closely rivaling the Beatles.  Right from the memorable riff of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" to the mellow \"Something in the Way\", you are in for a treat that combines all these elements.  There are no filler or even forgettable tracks here.  Few albums manage to get positive attention from both critics and mainstream listeners and not many 90's albums deserve it more than Nevermind.  In Utero might have been a better representation of the Nirvana sound but this is still a fantastic pop album.  Buy both.P.S. \"Nevermind\" should not have got higher than 'Pet Sounds' on the VH1 Best Albums of Rock and Roll countdown.  Even Cobain would have resented that.\n", "val": 0.01720060221850872}

The band wasn't really happy with the production, but this is what brought Nirvana into the mainstream, fueled by the Top 10 hit (reached #6)and \"anthem of Generation X\", \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" When you pop this album in and listen to it, the first thing you will here is the opening riff of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" This was the main reason I bought Nevermind back in 1995. I creamed my pants the first time I heard it. \"Teen Spirit\" is making fun of the idea of trying to start a revolution and that's what in fact did...start a revolution. Then, comes \"In Bloom.\" This song is a real sing along. It's about all of Nirvana's false fans (\"he's the one, who likes all are pretty songs and he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he knows not what it means.\") Then, comes another Top 40 hit(reached #32), \"Come As You Are.\" This is one of my personal favorite's. This song is basically about accepting people's differences. A great song! Next up is \"Breed.\" This song has one of the best intros ever, even better then, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Next, comes my favorite song of all time, \"Lithium.\" This is a powerful song, nough said. Next, \"Polly.\" This shows Kurt's songwriting genoius. \"Polly\" has a cool bass solo. Then, \"Territoral Pissings.\" This is a classic punk rock track. Done in one take and has great lyrics with very deep meaning. Kurt's favorite song \"Drain You\" is next. Probably the greatest song that never became a hit. Cool lyrics, cool bridge, just cool all around. \"Lounge Act\" follows up that great song. This shows the pop side of Nirvana. This would be a hit if it was released today. Number 10 is \"Stay Away.\" Some cool lyrics like \"Monkey see, monkey do/ rather be dead then cool/ every line ends in rhyme/ less is more love is blind\" and \"Stay away!!! God is Gay!!!\" Next, is \"On A Plain.\" Very catchy song. Then, there is \"Something In The Way.\" This is about when Kurt was homeless and living under the Aberdeen, Washington bridge. This album has been put of there with classic Beatles and Led Zepplin albums. Nirvana themselves have been compared to those bands and the Cobain/Lennon comparisons are very true.

{"text": "How pop music went from Smells Like Teen Spirit to actual teen spirit is beyond me. Anyhow, Nevermind is a stroke of brilliance, and it combined loud, hard-headed punk with a more slick, mainstream sound, making it one of the most listenable hard rock albums ever. But it wasn't just a good radio album, it was good period. Great even. In fact, it was a masterpiece.I know if Kurt Cobain were still alive he'd kill me for saying this, but Butch Vig's production really shaped Nirvana and made them who they are today. It's true. While it wasn't as raw (and raw isn't necessarily a good thing in my book) as Bleach or as true to the band as In Utero, Nevermind served its purpose as a well produced and very well written record. The sound summed up the alienation felt by 90's youth with its blaring guitars, very loud drums (Dave Grohl is one of the best drummers ever, hands down), and the intense vocal stylings of Cobain.The songs are genius. The incredibly catchy yet meaningful singles \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", \"In Bloom\", \"Come As You Are\", and \"Lithium\" all basically sum up the different aspects of the album, which is to say, diverse. In between the slow melodic \"Polly\", an acoustic song, and the fast and loud punk rock sound of \"Stay Away\", there's something on this album for every fan of rock and roll.There's such a thing as selling out, and thank god Nirvana did it. With great production, their previously choppy and plodding sound got \"fixed\" so to speak, allowing their brilliant lyrics and song writing to take center stage. While calling Nevermind the best album of the 90's is questionable, it certainly was the most important album of the 90's, and it helped shape the sound of the decade's rock more than any other.

But I read thru the reviews again & though I see some intelligent bits of writings, there's still a sea of both lovestruck fans & cynical assholes either from the stadium muso wanker scene or the harder than hardcore punk scene. I consider myself a well rounded listener & Nevermind is an old favourite. I don't consider it to be necessarily the most amazing bit of music ever, but I think it's still interesting enough. It stands @ the crossroads of an extremely commercial product & a deeply smart & worthwhile work of art. On each side [& KC believed in records still having 2 sides] you have 5 electric tunes & 1 acoustic to end it off. I like Nirvana but don't care for Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, or Led Zeppelin. If you're using the argument that the trio weren't virtuoso musicians, which they never ever claimed to be, I suggest forgeting boring whiteboy rawk & listen to JAZZ where you can have people who can play like hell & have the energy/emotion/depth of a Cobain [i.e. Miles, Ornette etc]. I think the production does work well here although I think using the same team of Butch Vig & Andy Wallace destroyed Sonic Youth's Dirty the next year, their worst sounding album. Nevermind is 'classic' as anything could ever be, naturally if it's the only thing you expose yrself to you'll get bored of it but it's still a fine record indeed. I have never been a casual music listener so I can't look @ things from the same perspective as a lot of you, I just say you should explore further, some albums of similar greatness in modern rock include The Fall's Grotesque, Sonic youth's Sister & Pavement's Slanted and Enchanted.

Smells Like Teen Spirit is one of the most compelling songs ever recorded, a complete classic.  That is the big song that single-handedly jolted Nirvana to the stratosphere.  Normally, big important albums have two or three songs that are sheep fodder filler material.  But Nevermind is solid from beginning to end. Come as you Are is murky, but contains a catharsis that borderlines on insanity.  Lithium, In Bloom, and Drain You are all brilliant  rockers that help to commercially give the album its obvious credibility(VH1).  But the best songs on the songs on the album were not released as singles.  Lounge Act, Stay Away, and Territorial Pissings are all up-tempo 4/4 time, but have such range and depth musically that makes me wonder at Cobain's genius even though the lyrics delineate constantly throughout each song .  The best song on the album is near the end: On a Plain moves between major and minor modes so well that it is unbelievable. The best ditty they EVER wrote.Although other albums may be more sonically involved or flat-out more musical(and probably should be #2), there is absolutely no argument that this album had a definite statement to send: This is our generation, not yours and noone can take THAT away from us...\n", "val": 0.023358089849352837}

What they had and what Kirt had was the ability through pop music to influence, forge, and remake the music of the day.  I love all the hits, but it's side two of NeverMind that I have really liked.  Writing a song, story, or poem should be from the soul.  Kirt did this very well and now we are stuck with a musical repeating cycle of the same stuff.  That's the big problem, I hear so many sound alike bands.  Kirt inadvertantly created a simular situation to what he was trying to overcome.

If you can answer yes to any of the above questions no doubt you agree that Nirvana's Nevermind is a masterpiece and easily the best album ever created.  Of course we all know that there is no better guitarist or vocalist than Cobain, in fact he was better than Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Eric Clapton rolled into one; and Dave Grohl is obviously a better drummer than John Bonham or Neil Peart.  But really, the song structures here are so complex that you'd better be a master of your instrument to even try to play these songs.  And oh my the lyrics, now I'm not sure if anyone else will agree with me but I think Cobain was a better songwriter than the Lennon/McCartney team ever was.

{"text": "Nirvana's fueled grunge thematics are the reason for the rock diversity that we have the pleasure of mandating to personal taste today.  Without question Nevermind is the group's greatest work and this generation's best album.  From the start of Smells Like Teen Spirit to the end of Something In the Way, this album hits and takes no misses.  I never figured out Kurt Cobain's logic in this title, since the term \"nevermind\" is usually pessimistic and surged by anger, suggesting that the item described is not important.  The title is the antonym of the music, because the album is much depper and enriching with Kurt Cobain's endevorous screaming, sevolistic guitars, the loud punching beat of Dave Ghol's drum set, and the upbeat kick of Chris Novesilic's bass.  The decided ultimatum effect is the promise that Nirvana have never been and never will be music recording sellouts.  The fact that the first 6 songs were all radio hits back in their time, almost 1 decade ago (Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, Lithium, and Polly) automatically ricochets this album out of its class.  At times, the vocals hit like a urning thunder that never reached its potential and is in turn angered in layers by the upset of its lost destiny (Drain You, Territorial Pissings), and at other times (Something In The Way, Come As You Are) there is a soft purge in Kurt's voice that shows a well-vouchered harmony, possibly coming from a man with displeansantries in his environment.  After you give this album a couple of solid listens you'll begin to understand what I'm getting at.  Territorial Pissings, Lounge Act, and On a Plane are the 3 songs besides Spirit that see the album at its blistering rock n' roll nostalgic peak.  In the midst of the 12 song anthem revolution, the grunge diversity of Nirvana adds up to the greatest noteworthy album of the decade and my compact disc collection.  Even if you don't understand a bit of the Nirvana compositions, buy this record and play along with the anarchy, because grunge won't last forever, and its reign has already died.

This  album is for me definitely up there.  Cobain was, if not one of the best,  at least one of the more interesting songwriters of the last decade.

{"text": ".......and \"Nevermind\" still sounds fresh. How? Nirvana were  just that damn good. Dave Grohl's drumming was not only powerful, but  lightning-speed fast (my personal pick for the greatest drummer ever).  Krist Novoselic's bass skills were amazing, melodic, furious, and catchy.  And Kurt Cobain, well, what can't you say about the guy? I can sit here and  say all these great (and true) things about Kurt, but I'll leave it at  this: there is a reason Kurt is a legend, and this was proven numerous  times before his unfortunate passing. All the classics are here, \"In  Bloom\", \"Lithium\", \"Come As You Are\" (my personal  favorite from the band), and, of course, \"Smells Like Teen  Spirit\". But the album as a whole is amazing. \"Drain You\" is  one of the best Alternative songs ever made. \"Breed\",  \"Territorial Pissings\", and \"Stay Away\" are punk rock  perfection. \"Something In The Way\" is haunting (it's far superior  on their \"Unplugged In New York\" album), while \"Polly\"  is a glimpse of Cobain's \"softer\" side at it's best. Even the  worst ones here, \"Lounge Act\" and \"On A Plane\", are  better than anything Creed will ever do (I guess that isn't saying much,  but you get the point, those two songs are still brilliant). Cobain was a  brilliant singer-songwriter, he could be filled with rage and self-doubt  one second (\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and \"Something In The  Way\") and be funny the next (\"Breed\" and  \"Lithium\"). From lines like \"Here we are now, entertain  us\" to \"I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you\", not  many could even come close to the talent of Kurt Cobain. From start to  finish, Nirvana made one of those rare albums that manages to pull  everything out of the bare essentials (guitars, bass, drums) and make an  absolute classic out of it. Some of these songs sound better on the band's  live albums, and even \"In Utero\" was just as good as  \"Nevermind\" (despite what some say), and even those two albums  put together could not equal \"Unplugged In New York\"; but this  still stands as a landmark for not only rock, but music in general.

{"text": "Labels and hype aside, Nevermind is without a shadow of a doubt the best  Grunge album ever written, and one of the best rock albums of all time. Not  since The Doors debut album has such a groundbreaking and revolutionary  album been released. The whole mood of Nevermind is so dark and lush.  Kurt's voice draws you into the music like no other singer could.Yes, it  has \"The Best Song Of The 90's\" on it, \"Smells Like Teen  Spirit\", which is a great starter for the album. \"In Bloom\"  is a similar style song, with meaningful lyrics. \"Come As You  Are\" is an amazing and hypnotic song, managing to depress you as much  as it puts you in awe. \"Lithium\" and \"Polly\" are two  other great moody melodic slow songs. \"Breed\", \"Territorial  Pissings\", and \"Stay Away\" are all great Teen Spirit-like  songs...angry and raw, which might bring back memories from Bleach.The  album closes on a very moving note, \"Something In The Way\", a  slow acoustic ballad in which Kurt talks about his experience living under  a bridge and being homeless. Such a moving and emotional ending to an album  hasn't been done since \"The End\" by The Doors, but was later  outdone by \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails. Nonetheless, Nevermind is  certainly an essential in everyone's music library. And everyone knows that  it's THAT good already, so my recommendation and hype regarding it  shouldn't matter very much.\n", "val": 0.03933556377887726}

Kurt's masterful song writing and sometimes painful  but always awsome sounding voice come together perfectly to create a  musical masterpiece.  Nirvana's sound is basically grunge band perfection.  Fred Durst has said before that the best music is made by bands in their  garages that are never discovered by the general public.  Nirvana is one of  those great garage bands that we were fortunate enough to discover.  Anyone, especially if they call themselves a rock fan, who doesn't find  Nevermind to be one of the best albums to ever be made (ok I admit  Metallica's Black Album was the best album of 1991, but Nevermind is a  close second) needs to just rip their ear drums out now, or at least quit  listening to music.

{"text": "After reading everyone's opinions and I have to admit some of the people that hated it brought up some rudimentary points I felt the need to comentate.  A good rock album (to me) is one that can spark up heavy  emotion and perspective. I'm only 15 and missed out on the grunge scene  when \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was overplayed but I remember  being 10 and first hearing Teen Spirit and the chord changes hooked me.  Later on in life I bought the album and clocked in many hours of air guitar  playing before I snapped and begged my parents to buy me a guitar. I  remember being mad on several occasion and playing a rendition of  \"Territorial Pissings\" on my guitar and screaming as loud as  Kurt.\"Gotta find a way, a better way\" The songs in this album are  excellent examples of what good music is, which is an artist putting his  own twist on his influences and you can hear echoes of The Who or a hard  rock Beatles (Helter Skelter) on \"Come As You Are\" and  \"Drain You\" Krist Novoselic even admitted that Tenn Spirit  sounded like a Pixies rip-off. And Kurt even added strings to  \"Something in The Way\" even the hidden track \"Endless  Nameless\" is a result of Kurt's listening to feedback records. Kurt is  not the greatest guitarist in the world but in \"Endless Nameless\"  and later in In Utero Kurt shows his skills in noisemaking he made his  guitar drone out endless amounts of feedback cacophony which to me is pure  bliss. No one except for Thurston Moore can make anti-solos like Kurt could  and as for the rest of the album he blended punk rock and hard rock into  these 12 songs which are excellent sonic blasts and through all of the  distortion and the spitfire drums are some thoughtful, cynical lyrics.  \"In Bloom\" for example attacks the macho man who listens to their  songs and dosen't know what they mean \"Come As You Are\" is like a  challenging invitation, to go into sociey \"doused in mud\" or  \"as I want you to be\" and will be forever haunting becuse Cobain  swears he dosen't have a gun. \"Polly\" is about a raping in  Seattle a haunting tale of how a 14 year old girl was raped by what Cobain  called \"a waste of sperm and eggs\" However all of the songs  revealed to the world how a fragile soul in all of his pain and his hidden  genius turn a melody into an artform. Let all the speculation fall away  becuse while boy/girl groups and shallow rap rock dominate the airwaves, I  will turn to Nevermind and all of the other great rock albums as an  influence for my own band and we'll hopefully change music around as Cobain  did for us 9 years ago. This is (and I know Kurt would hate the praise)the  best alt-rock album of the 90's and it will live in the hearts of  Generation X'ers forever those who don't understand it are either too old  to care to young and ignorant or unfortunatly too shallow to know good  music when they hear it\n", "val": 0.0041073039174079895}

As  a regular supporter of leftwing causes, there are times when I think this  band's convergence onto the music scene had a big influence in the 1992  elections, and political conciousness of gen-x.Unlike so many rock  acts, these guys were not afraid of taking unpopular and unmanly positions  on social issues.  The passion found in this album (and the band) is the  missing ingredient from so many acts. It's gotten to the point, where  people have lost sight of the orginal goal of alternative music.  To  subvert  mainstream values and thought patterns in hope of a better more  diverse world.It's a shame Kurt Cobain died, because he would have no  doubt continued to churn out superb recordings.

{"text": "Is there a more perfect CD than Nirvana's \"Nevermind\"? From start to finish it never once falters; all the songs are shiny and excellent. Chris Novoselic, the group's bass guitarist, once said that an album like \"Nevermind\" could have been released in the 1970s, `80s or `90s, making the astute point that its timeless sound transcends decades. I think he's right, for the most part, but I love the fact that this CD came out at an influential time in my life (college), and at a time when many people who payed attention to such things were ready for an exciting, brand-new sound.Personally, I didn't immediately latch on to the first single from \"Nevermind,\" \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" and to this day it remains my least favorite tune on the album. Be that as it may, it was harder for others to ignore Kurt Cobain's obvious anguish within the song, which comes through via pained screaming, crashing cymbals by drummer Dave Grohl and a tone of wonderment during the softer moments. From there, \"Nevermind\" breezes along like the best punk-pop-rock CD you've ever heard, each song ultra-catchy and excruciatingly sing-along-ish. The hefty production work by Butch Vig, which Cobain later panned in a major way, lends an extra beefed-up sheen to the crunchy guitar chords, Ghrol's frantic, hard drumming and Cobain's dynamic vocals.The highlights on this album? There's too many to mention, but here's a stab at it: \"In Bloom\" is as endearingly catchy as it gets, designed specifically for the type of person Cobain despised who \"likes all the pretty songs...but don't know what it means\"; \"Come as You Are\" is softer and more subtle-sounding, a well-known tune that still gets radio airplay and likely always will; \"Breed,\" \"Lithium,\" \"Territorial Pissings\" and \"Stay Away\" are aggressively loud with in-your-face choruses, powerful drumming and run-but-you-can't-hide guitar riffs that made Nirvana famous; \"Lounge Act\" and \"On a Plain\"are a bit more mid-tempo but easily as thrilling; and on the softer side of things, the tragic realms of \"Polly\" and \"Something in the Way\" could break your heart with their acoustic sincerity and lowdown worlds. Finally, for those who like to hang around to the bitter end, don't miss the tacked-on but severely explosive \"Endless Nameless,\" which clocks in at thirteen minutes, 51 seconds at the very end of the CD. \"Hidden tracks\" on a CD were a new concept and tactic to me (and likely many others) back in the early '90s, and who better to introduce such a sly maneuver than Cobain, who comes off as a mad, guitar-loving scientist doing his thing with abandon on the high-energy, unfocused song.Perhaps, like many, I've played this CD to death, thus diminishing some of its original luster, no different than those dusky Led Zeppelin albums that no longer got played in my CD collection and were eventually sold off. But, make no mistake, I will never get rid of this album. Every once in a great while a rock `n' roll record comes out that changes the worlds of those that follow such stuff. For me, such albums included&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Boston-Digipak/dp/B000EQ47GS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Boston [Digipak</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pyromania/dp/B000001F2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pyromania</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Appetite-for-Destruction/dp/B000000OQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Appetite for Destruction</a>&nbsp;and certainly this one.

{"text": "Is there any doubt that this is the landmark album of the 1990's?  Some might say this distinction belongs to Dr. Dre's THE CHRONIC, Beck's ODELAY, Pearl Jam's TEN, or even Radiohead's OK COMPUTER, but NEVERMIND has to be  the choice.  The entire genre of rock throughout the 90's was based on this  record with every band trying to recapture its memorable sound and market  appeal.  Of course \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was the anthem that  started the alternative revolution, but there's quality in many other songs  here besides just this.  I'm not sure why, but \"Something In The  Way\" has always stood out to me with its gentle, yet sad mood.  The  haunting \"Come As You Are\" will always remain an emotional track  because of the circumstances that would follow a few years later.  The true  punk roots of Nirvana are shown well in \"Territorial Pissings,\"  which is possibly the most brutal and emotional song I've ever heard.  \"In Bloom\" and \"Lithium\" became MTV and radio staples  for good reason since they displayed with a vengenace that NEVERMIND had  much more depth beyond its well-known first hit.  My final favorite, among  many, would be \"Polly\" because of its mid-tempo pace and hummable  chorus that isn't buried amongst the guitars.  It's a shame to see about  ten copies of this CD in every used record store I walk into because it  should be a part of any fan's collection who has absoluely the slightest  interest at all in rock, metal, punk, or power-pop music.\n", "val": 0.009000128135085106}

{"text": "Contrary to the rating above, I give this album a rating of as many stars as one cares to place on the page.  I heard \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on MTV years ago, and so I bought the album--trying to ignore  the rather vulgar part of the cover--and I listened to only a couple songs  on it, which was a mistake.  I gradually began to listen to others, and  then decided that Nirvana was my favorite band.  They are not as loud as  other rock bands that I like, such as Korn, but Kurt was a hell of a writer  and performer.  His lyrics are sort of surreal, and Kurt seems to have a  focus on sickness and disease in some songs, but that was probably how he  felt in his mind while writing some of these due to his troubles with  heroin that led to his untimely and saddening demise.  He truly knew what  he was doing when it came to music, though.  His songs inspired an entire  generation.  Anyone that has not heard or bought this album definitely  should.  In Utero is also one of their best.  I hope people will give this  a chance, and learn to like it if they are skeptical.\n", "val": 0.004586479160934687}
{"text": "Whenever people list the most influential and/or best albums of this past decade, perhaps even of all time, this CD seems to come at the top of every list.  And with good reason; Kurt Cobain was a flat-out genius.  As great  as In Utero is, it isn't even close to this.  Out of the 12 songs, 11 are  classics.  The only one that doesn't have the same effect as it did in 1991  is On A Plain.  Which is still good.  Remove tracks 1, 3 and 5 (you know  what they are), and you'll still have one of the greatest CD's ever.  In  fact, that's how I grew to fall in love with this CD for the second time.  Teen Spirit, Come As You Are and Lithium are now rock staples, but you've  heard them far too many times to spin them constantly at home.  The best  not-so-widely-heard songs include the punkish Stay Away, the melancholy  Something In The Way and the abrasive Territorial Pissings.  And despite  the constant airplay, In Bloom is simply too damned good to skip.  Despite  the hundreds of thousands of copycats, Nirvana's sound stays fresh due to  Novoselic's cool bass lines, Grohl's intricate and complex drum playing,  and of course, Cobain's piercing, deeply affecting growl, which is  unmistakable despite the hordes of imitators.  I don't care if you'll puke  if you ever hear Teen Spirit again, if you haven't heard all 12 songs (and  there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't have) it is mandatory that  you pick this up.  Behind Mr Bungle's self-titled debut (which isn't suited  for most tastes, but I'm just biased) this is quite simply the best  freakin' thing I have ever heard in my whole life.\n", "val": 0.034539248794317245}

Fusing a loud, searing punk roar with catchy pop melodies, Nevermind made Nirvana a household name.  From the breakthrough hit \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" to the eerie  \"Something In The Way\", this album is a sheer delight. \"In  Bloom\" epitomizes their sound the best, with  catchy sing-song verses  juxtaposed with a raging, monolithic, deafening chorus. Another reason for  the success of Nevermind was Kurt Cobain's haunting narratives of teenage  insecurity. Even today, they still touch upon something deep within the  soul. And let us not forget the fierce rythym section of Dave Grohl and  Krist Novoselic.

When I got it home it never came out of the CD player for about a  month.  I listend to it over and over again.  Smells Like Teen Spirit is  probably their most famous song, and it is probably the only one that  people remember. The way that Kurt writes his songs is marvelous, he can  contrast between happy and depressing.  The places that he gets his  inspiration from to write his songs can seem a little bizare.  For example,  Smells Like Teen Spirt was inspired by a womens purfume called Teen Spirit,  and Heart Shaped Box was written about a shell coverd box in the shape of a  heart that he sent to Courtney Love shortly after they met. If you have  already read this review and looked at the reviews for the other Nirvana  albums and are wondering why I have not reviewed them if I'm such a big  fan, well it's because it would be pointless to review them all because  there is nothing else to say.

I know I'd come to the point with my reviews I'd HAVE to review this one also, so here it goes: \"Nevermind\" has been on practicly every TOP 100 Rock-album charts after it's release in 1991. And  when you listen to it through you will find out why. Kurt Cobain was not  the  straightest kind of lyrics-writer, and the meaning of his texts may  occasionally strike as hard-to-find. But still, despite the restlessness of  the lyrics, he managed to capture the feelings that teenagers were are  going through. But the importance of this album lays as much on the  catchy-but-clever melodies. Kurt Cobain's vocals match perfectly with the  music, Krist Novoselic's bass brings the deepness into their rage, and Dave  Grohl's pattering drums make the music sound you've being attacked by a  huge vawe of rock'n'roll noise. This album shows that Nirvana was equally  as taleted with the lighter, more sensitive tracks than with the  hardrockmonsters they becam famous from. So this album is by all means a  way more than just teh hit rack The Sm... oh, you know what!  actually, it  is not even the best track on the album. If you don't believe me, just  listen to Polly, Come As You Are of Something In The Way. Actually every  track on this album should be a rock'n'roll classic.

{"text": "Forever called the most influential record of the nineties, I can't help but vomit upon hearing the failed attempt at music on this seminal grunge favorite.  This is one of the worst records ever recorded.  Kurt Cobain has  the skill of a beginning guitar player, most of which have more.  I could  play this whole album after playing guitar for a month.  I figured out  Smells Like Teen Spirit the first couple of minutes I held a guitar in my  hands.  He sounds like he's dying on these indecipherable and illogical  lyrics.  If I want to hear somebody scream, I can always pull out my Morbid  Angel, and listen to David Vincent scream over Trey Azagtoth's crushing  talented guitar riffs.  In other words, Nevermind is the worst album of all  time.  I found that it did make an attractive coaster though.\n", "val": 2.4559347366448492e-05}
{"text": "Nirvana changed music as we know it.Now that I said that, I want to get on to the songs before I talk about Cobain as a guitarist/songwriter.01-Smells Like Teen Spirit: This, as you should  know, is a very good and well written song, with lots of genuine anger and  energy.02-In Bloom: A very good song as well, with funny lyrics and a  nice bassline as well. This song is easy listening for grunge and punk  fans, I liked it upon first listen.03-Come As You Are: Another radio hit  from this album, with trippy music and lyrics; really psychedelic and cool,  I found myself listening to this song over and over. Among the best lyrics  Cobain has ever written.04-Breed: An absolute joy to hear, I just cannot  get enough of this song. The verses are so so, but the chorus absolutely  ROCKS.05-Lithium: The third radio hit from this album, with good lyrics  and sounds just like your average grunge hit...sounds a lot like those  posers Bush.06-Polly: A nice acoustic balance, easy listening even for  those who do not like Grunge; Cobain's voice is perfect in this one,  too.07-Territorial Pissings: IMO the best song on the album, it  literally JUMPS out at you and speeds up more and more until the final  crash. Though the song is short, the lyrics are great and the music is  heavy as hell.08-Drain You: My second favorite from this album, a bit  more tame but no less Nirvana than any of their other stuff, nothing bad  here at all.09-Longe Act: A very good alternative hit and the FOURTH  radio hit from this album, the lyrics are excellent and it is as catchy as  any pop song.10-Stay Away: A good song, but the album's only weak point.  Even though it is a good song, it simply cannot hold up to the other  ones.11-On a Plain: A narcissistic song by Cobain that is as catchy as  any of their stuff, and rocks all the way. Definately a high point, no  question.12-Something in the Way: The work of a true poet, really an  incredible ballad...Cobain's voice needed a bit of work on it, but it's  still great.13-Hidden Song: An ANGRY song by the Nirv and IMO is  excellent to jam to.Overall, this album is damn near perfect.Now  onto Cobain...he may not have been the GREATEST guitarist ever, but at  least he played solos (even with their simplicity) as opposed to a group  like Korn, who relies on power chords. Cobain is a good singer for a grunge  band, too. No, he wasn't the greatest, but he was very good.Another  standout is David Grohi, one of the best drummers in the past 20 years. He  can REALLY play well, even if he does overdo somethings sometimes. He  deserves a lot of credit for the songs being so good.\n", "val": 0.027663221582770348}

{"text": "In the 80s, alternative music had, basically, three mediums to which fans could turn -- college radio, underground music clubs, and word of mouth.  MTV was preoccupied with spinning mousse-abuse new metal bands, and lighter  fare, and alternative was relegated to its midnight program, '120  Minutes...' that is, until this particular band just COULDN'T be ignored.  The 90s *really* began with a scream -- and musical, visual and social  orders shifted seemingly overnight -- with the worldwide exposure of  Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" from this disc.  Lyricist/vocalist/guitarist Kurt Cobain proved he understood and could  represent his generation's mood just as deftly as Lennon/McCartney had  tapped into their own.  \"Here we are, now entertain us,\" Cobain  wryly challenged, on behalf of (and in mocking disgust with) disaffected  youth, and the media scrambled to make sense of it all (and then to  capitalize on terms like grunge, slacker, and Generation X, until even  those in the genre got tired of the spin... some, like Cobain, with  disasterous results.)  \"Nevermind\" ranks among the most powerful,  harrowing and compelling rock recordings ever made.  Cobain explores  frustration, boredom, and narcissism in an often gallows humor fashion, and  time taken to explore the lyrics will reveal a poet at work.  The  alternative artists of the 80s and early 90s, whose best chances for  exposure were to create their own labels and handle their own marketing --  prior to Nirvana having been snapped up from Sub Pop, by Geffen, thus  opening up the alternative market to radio and MTV -- are the forefathers  of today's net-savy up-and-comings. Any musician or listener interested in  the progression of popular music owes it to themselves to pay much  attention to this disc; it's one of those rare and true watersheds of rock  & roll.  For those who are curious, but still hesitant because you  believe Cobain's angst is all this band is about, don't be fooled:  all  three musicians understood the value of a good hook, and there's more  melody going on, here, than initially meets the ear.  The bass lines of  Chris Novoselic provide real counterpoint to the guitar and vocals, and the  exciting powerhouse drumming of Dave Grohl (now of Foo Fighter fame) is  tightly controlled, every kick, slam and roll adding a third voice to the  mix.  Parents, teachers, or local leaders experiencing teen problems in the  home or community will want to listen closely:  \"Nevermind\" was  released in 1991, and Cobain's messages about the effects of  disillusionment, on youth, are reflected in the headlines of today.  You'll  be enlightened as you discover what's still on some young minds, and why.\n", "val": 0.00961737334728241}

Yeah well, if thatss so easy then where's YOUR cd? Every song  on Nevermind has an instantly catchy hook, that you didn't write. Maybe  it's easy to learn to his songs, but not to create them.-This is NOT the  greatest CD ever made. Pick a musical group off the top of your head, any  group. Now search for them at Amazon and you'll see a reviewer proclaiming  that \"this is the greatest cd ever made! \" No. No CD is, it's all  a matter of opinion. -Nirvana was incredibly influential in the 90's, but  the only decent imitator I've listened to were Bush. A horrible one was  Offspring. When I heard the first few notes of their Self-Esteem song I  almost vomited because it sounded almost exactly like Teen Spirit.-Dave  Grohl is a really good drummer. From what I understand he wasn't with them  on Bleach, their first CD. I wonder what happened to that original drummer.  Poor guy. Any Nevermind lover that doesn't own Bleach is really missing  out.-Anyway, this is a truly great CD and the only one I've ever given five  stars here at Amazon.

{"text": "Why review this record? What can possibly be said that hasn't been said ? Well let's give it a shot. First of all this is not the greatest record of all times (not even the 90's). Those that think it is just haven't listened  to enough music. The kids with the Kurt memorial shirts at the Bush concert  think it speaks to them but they are too young and too musically ignorant  to appreciate it as it truly should be appreciated. How should it be  appreciated then? As an era defining recording. The album that drug the  underbelly out of its comfortable private sludge and into the mainlight.  The album that started the executive gold rush for the \"next big  thing\" and created a thousand pitiful imitators that can now be heard  polluting the airwaves on your local \"new rock\" stations (quiet  verse/heavy chorus/quite verse-repeat then cash check). The album that  destroyed Seattle's private party. The album that helped numerous deserving  artists get national recognition (see Melvins, Flipper, Wipers, Hole(! ),  etc.) The album that started the smack chic fashion craze not to mention  flannel(I actually felt uncomfortable in my Chucks and flannel around '95)  The album that produced the last great video. When you think early 90's,  this is the soundtrack (like Sgt. Peppers, Rumors, even Thriller in the  preceding decades)There was a time that I could not go anywhere and not  hear this album. One night I remember drinking and listening to it in my  little college campus slum and then turning it off and hearing it blasting  from a field next to my house where some party was being held. For that  reason I guess is why it is special because it gave unity to a generation  that had none. This record gave out an us vs. them attitude without the  tired old hardcore formula. The guys in Nirvana were my age and they looked  and dresses and in some ways thought like me and I identified with it. It  was hard to identify with Crue, I just didn't lead that life. As for the  music, good pop songs dressed in puk/metal clothing-catchy but not sappy. I  haven't played it in years and don't plan to anytime soon but it will  always have a place in my heart because it defines a place and time in my  life that I will(thankfully) never be at again.

{"text": "Undoubtably the seminal rock recording of the 1990's, Nirvana's Nevermind strikes a chord with virtually every teenager living in the 90s.  From \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" to Something in the Way\" every  song is a anthem, a battle-cry, a call to arms for a  generation that has  been snubbed as being \"lazy, unmotivated, and mindless\".  No  other recording of the 1990's, or any decade for that matter quite captures  the youthful exuberance and spirit to the same degree as this amazing  record.  In the same way that Dylan, Springsteen, and Bono's lyrics spoke  to the people of their respective times, Nirvana's music is forever etched  in the memory of all who grew up in 1990s.  A major change was upon all of  music when this amazing album from a band from Seattle calling themselves  Nirvana knocked Michael Jackson's \"Dangerous\" album from the top  of the charts.  It was the all-encompassing sign that to quote Dylan,  \"the times they are-a-changin\" , and indeed, from that moment  music would never be the same.  Nirvana, through their lead singer Kurt  Cobain and as a band, though now disbanded, have gained special rock and  roll notoriety equivalent to legend status.  One can only wonder what  impact their music would be having now...\n", "val": 0.015124502591788769}

Being too young to have been a fan when this album was  realesed, it was clearly the first Nirvana album that I should have bought.  Every song without exception is a hit on its own.  The album's songs range  in emotion over the entire spectrum.  \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"  is an excellent up-beat and fun song which transends to the youth of any  generation, while \"Something In the Way\" is heart-felt and sad.

Really, when you consider that the story line of the movie was set in rural Texas it is more likely that Blake's version would fit in better than the earlier one.

Her vocal ability made the hairs stand up on my arms then and now.  I love listening to her sing.I bought it yesterday.  I've listened to the CD 3 times.  My favorite song on here is \"Blue God\".  OMG, that woman's voice is INCREDIBLE.  I could listen to her sing \"God God God God\" over and over again and I would be just fine.  For me, an album has to have vocal appeal to it first before I would ever hear the words.  The sound has to attract me.  Now, I'm listening to the lyrics and I'm loving it.  Blue God appears to be that one song on this album that I have picked out to be on my repeat for a few days until I learn the song.I read the review by the person that left the only negative comment on this album, I don't see how someone could listen to this album and walk away with a negative thought.  Her style is contemporary jazzy gospel.  And this album is just that.  its beautiful.I will have to come back and comment about why I did not give this album 5 stars or move it to 5 stars.

Don't get me wrong yanna was good but i just liked jessica better. i loved her style and her beautiful deep voice. i guess i'm a sucker for deep voices, jazz and gospel. those three combined is one dynamite combination! my mother liked yanna better until i played jessica reedy for her. my mother was in tears listening to her and coudn't believe who it was. see my mother didn't like her on sunday best but now she does. If you're interested in this cd, BUY IT!!! THIS CD IS AWESOME!\n", "val": 0.02555541880428791}

She does some things vocally that you just don't hear today, but are absolutely satisfying to listen to. This album does NOT sound like every other new gospel album coming out recently!

{"text": "When I first got this album, I put it into rotation and listened to it for two weeks straight before I just had to force myself to stop listening to it!  That's only because I want to be able to continue to enjoy Jessica Reedy.  I have been waiting for this project and it does not disappoint at all.  Jessica's unique silky alto voice shines on this album with my favorite being \"Blue God\".  The songs on this album are both masterfully produced and well written with substance a meaning. The album really does reflect Jessica's humble personality, she doesn't scream, she doesn't holler, she just sings and you feel it in the music.  Gospel music is the original \"soul\" music and I for one don't believe it should ever be fused with the modern R&B club sound just to appeal to certain audiences.  I believe gospel musicians should always record with the musicians so the \"feel\" can come through.  You can hear that in this music, a true gospel artist will \"make\" the musicians play.  Jessica, you did your thang!!!!\n", "val": 0.03166234493255615}

He will also be scoring \" The Warren Files \", which promises to be a powerful and terrifying excursion into evil.In my opinion, this soundtrack ranks up their with the true \" Masters \" of music making. I'd put him next to Gershwin for \" Standards \" \" John Lennon for \"Rock Lyrics \",  \" Brian Wilson for rock harmony and arrangements\", and now Joseph Bishara for \"Scary, haunting movie Soundtracks\". It's THAT good.I can't wait to hear what this genius comes up with for \" The Warren Files. \" By the way, I wouldn't listen to \" Insidious \" while you are alone at night in a house.

{"text": "Havana Brown's \"We Run the Night\" has a lot of really good qualities, though a few things spoil it: chiefly, Pitbull's on the track. Secondly, the versus could have been written much better.Let's start with the negatives: since \"Planet Pit,\" Pitbull has seriously damaged his image and legitimacy on the music scene. His material is just cheap pop and not the good stuff he used to make a few years back. His rap on this tune really damages it, as he keeps rhyming \"baby\" with \"baby\" repeatedly, and even mentions his \"hunger.\" Hunger? Please. You're a superstar.Havana Brown's lyrics aren't that great. I'm not talking about \"runem like runem runem\" or anything. I'm talking about her versus. They're cliche and don't really tell anything. For all I know, his lyrics are just silly words sprinkled around the song to put in some shallow substance. Allow me to present an example:\"Feelin like a rush rush rushPushing past me all over my skinI can get enough nough nough'cause the beat keep pullin' me inTaking me so high up up upA place that I've never been ahh..\"So, the beat takes over her body and takes her to new heights. Boy, I haven't heard that one before.Now, the good stuff: the beat, Brown's voice, and the synth.The bass is massive. Pump the song through a big sound system... you'll know what I mean. Also, the beat really does make one want to dance, preferably at a night club.Though her lyrics aren't terribly deep, Havana Brown's feminine voice, added with just a little bit of auto tune, really does fit the song quite well. It's no wonder this song's been successful with crowds dancing.The same could be said for the synth- it fits the song perfectly, and isn't overly used nor obnoxious.I'd buy the song if I were you. It'll really get your spirits/energy up, and if pregaming, this song will get you and your friends pumped for a fun night out.\n", "val": 0.0002412617759546265}

So, having a catalog of fresh dubstep anthems that share that feeling of salvation is a major blessing. When we're rolling or trippin, we often talk about JC, his life, his love. We talk about our lord who art in heaven, and all of the angels, and saints, and our man in the Vatican with his killer wardrobe and hat collection.

{"text": "First I have to say that I am a Christian and I like Dubstep, But worship songs and dubstep apparently do not mix because this music makes me angry. I was searching for Christian dubstep in hopes of finding a remix of something like Red, Manafest, or Thousand Food Krutch, and I stumbled upon this. I was a little skeptical but intrigued in dubstep worship music. A couple problems though. While I actually like and own many of these original songs the artist ruined these completely, and calling it dubstep is a massive stretch. Second, the sound quality is terrible, and the mixing is worse. I have heard better sounding live recordings off of a cell phone. One thing that I find interesting is the need for Christian dubstep. Most dubstep has no words at all, so inherently dubstep is very neutral. Sure some artists mix in some less that ideal secular songs, but you don't have to listen to them. As a Christian and a lover of music, this cd brings shame to Christian music and will most likely offend someone who actually listens to and likes dubstep.\n", "val": 4.090787479071878e-05}

{"text": "I'll admit I came into listening this album with a large degree of skepticism. It seemed like a mash-up so bizarre that it literally could not work. However, that philosophy drives a lot of dubstep, including much of the best the genre has to offer.  Naturally, intrigue got the best of me, and I wanted to like this even if just for the amusing novelty that it exists.Wow.  And I don't mean \"wow\" like the label that put this out.  I mean wow as in it's worse than you think.  If you're a parent with a child who enjoys dubstep and you think this is a way to shepherd them back towards the flock, this CD will only result in resentment.  The music is not dubstep by even the most lax definition of the word, and you'll only make your child feel like you don't care about them enough to actually learn anything about what they're interested in.  It's not even laughable, but downright offensive. I had it on in the background, and I couldn't tell when one song ended and another began.  I had to double check to see if it was the same song an embarrassing number of times.  I could understand this as a complaint about the genre as a whole, as even I'll admit a lot of dubstep sounds awfully similar.  Still, this is a problem when the music sounds more like a rejected Ke$ha beat than deadmau5.The worst part of all is how this album subtly subverts genuine Christian values.  The fact that this is not dubstep makes it clear that the people behind it weren't concerned with presenting Christian values through a new musical venue; they knew dubstep is popular, and are trying to make money off of of parents who want their children to hold their faith, but aren't interested in actually learning a thing about what their kids like.  Alternatively, I suppose the target audience could be devout Christians trying to remain up-to-date on what's trendy, but the end result is still a record company trying to take advantage of people who don't know dubstep from \"The Cha-Cha Slide.\"  This sort of deceit in the name of a quick buck, especially at the expense of people who genuinely believe something, is desperate and wholly low-brow. The producers should be ashamed. They probably aren't. I assume it's hard to feel guilt while you're counting your money from people you straight-up conned.\n", "val": 3.323063356219791e-05}
