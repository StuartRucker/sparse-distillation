Unlike some other records, even great ones, from the '80s, it's still fresh -- I don't listen to it as a nostalgia record, it's one of those records I've just always played, because it never got old. The album has a definite Western theme, but it's more rock than C&W for the most part. It's heavy on ballads, like \"All is Quiet...\" and \"The Preacher\" -- not ballads as in slow love songs, but songs that tell engaging stories. Lots and lots of guitars, incredible vocals, strong songwriting... I never got why they weren't huge.\n", "val": 0.03180548548698425}

However, when a bigwig plans on killing them off, they have to escape from the soundstage and expose the truth...with assassins chasing them! This is a Collector's Choice CD version of Jerry Goldsmith's music score for Capricorn One. There's another CD version from Intrada that I haven't listened to. Still, this is a pleasing package and one can own it for less than $20. As someone else already claimed, Goldsmith rerecorded some tracks for the LP version. \"Kay's Theme\" has a disco beat that contemporary people may find dated and cheesy. \"Main title\" is very exciting.

{"text": "I've been waiting many years to get a new version of this album.  This was one of my Holy Grail albums, great (but obscure) albums that I never expected to see on CD.  This is MP3 instead of CD, but it sure beats the worn out cassette I bought back in 1980!I first became aware of Sue Saad when I heard \"Your Lips-Hands-Kiss-Love\" on the radio a few times.  The song didn't become a hit, but I bought the album on cassette, and I just loved it.  Some of my friends also loved the album and bought copies of it, but it never caught on.  It's mainstream commercial rock, sort of in the vein of Pat Benatar.  Sue Saad's voice sounds nothing like Benatar, but, like Benatar, she has serious lung power.  The album is no-frills rock:  two guitars, bass, drums, and Saad's amazing voice.  This album is all killer, no filler.  Most of the songs are rockers, but there are a couple of great ballads as well (\"Prisoner\" and \"Cold Night Rain\").  Excellent songs, smart lyrics, a tight band, and Sue Saad's glorious pipes.This MP3 version of the album also includes three songs that Sue Saad recorded for various movie soundtracks later in the Eighties.  Those songs are nothing special.  Of course, the singing is great, but the songs themselves are pretty ordinary.  Also, I'm pretty sure these three songs were not recorded with her original band.  It's all cheesy Eighties synths instead of guitar, and it sounds like a different drummer.But the main attraction here is the original album: Ten excellent songs with a killer band and a great singer.  If there were any justice in this world, Sue Saad would have been as big a star as Pat Benatar.\n", "val": 0.0059888348914682865}

{"text": "Back in the day (70s and 80s), radio stations used to play live concerts sometimes on the weekend. I caught about the last half of Sue Saad And The Next in concert on a local (Dallas) radio station while driving. I was so impressed that as soon as I was able to stop and locate a pen, I wrote her name down so I wouldn't forget it. A couple of weeks later, I found their album at Sears. It came out (I believe) in early 1980. It is, by far, one of my favorite albums of all time. Very close to what Pat Benetar and Deborah Harry were doing at the time. The band is very tight instrumentally and vocally. I wish to hell they would release this album on cd. I'm not sure whatever happened to Sue Saad. If anyone has any idea, I would be curious to know. I know she did some songs for a couple movies; one being 'Looker,' but pretty much disappeared by mid 80s. Very saad, she certainly had the talent! Buy this album. You won't be sorry.\n", "val": 0.018106503412127495}

{"text": "I've recently read a couple critics who actually use terms such as \"rather disappointing\" and \"bland\" in reference to this CD. I have to wonder exactly what these critics are listening for as they reach these conclusions; to me, Redman, backed up by an absolutely phenomenal rhythm section, offers forth an intense display of energy and musicianship. I don't see how it is possible that somebody could listen to this CD with open ears and not notice how incredibly exciting the music is. Anybody who can't hear raw creativity and energy on \"Freedom in the Groove\" is thinking too much, in my humble opinion. I don't remember if it was Pops, Miles, or Duke that said, \"If it sounds good, it is good.\" But this music is very, very good.It should be noted that the rhythm section is rock solid throughout, and the entire quintet really meshes nicely during solos and so forth. Certainly, some of Redman's later music is brilliant as well. But this album shouldn't be overlooked in the least.\n", "val": 0.01756412535905838}
{"text": "Since he burst onto the jazz scene in the early 90's, Joshua Redman has constantly redefined the role of the jazz musician.  Without abandoning his jazz roots he has found innumerable ways to advance the art of music.  His musical sensibilities allow him to demonstrate tremendous musicality while at the same time making everything he plays popularly accessible.This album was the point at which his stunning synthesis of genres really came into its own.  Redman always records with only the finest musicians, and this album demonstrates it clearly with all four of the supporting cast truly understanding Redman's music and his mission.  Brian Blade is the best drummer out there as far as I'm concerned (check out his CD \"Perceptual\" w/ the Brian Blade Fellowship).  Peter Bernstien works the guitar, Peter Martin on piano, and Christopher Thomas handles the bass.  All three of these guys are probably in the top 10 of young musicians on their respective instruments.The entire album is great, and it's quite easy to play straight through, but I have a few favorite tunes.  \"Cat Battles\" is awesome; great melody, great changes and great soloing by everybody.  The first track, \"Hide and Seek\", is just cool, if only for Redman's incredible intro.  I have some friends who live by \"When the Sun Comes Down\", and I sure can't argue with the fact that its a beautiful song.This and his next two releases \"Timeless Tales\" and \"Beyond\" might very well be the future of jazz, and I wouldn't be at all disappointed if they were.\n", "val": 0.043694306164979935}

The grooves are inspiring, and the melodies  are bluesy yet very unique.  Harmonically adventurous, yet soulful and  spirited.  I would even venture so far as to call this session the Blue  Trane of the 90's.\n", "val": 0.02132870815694332}

{"text": "Over the past thirteen years Avalon has become a mainstay in CCM. Their blend of pop, dance, and R&B inflected songs that invariably bring the honor to God are both infective and musically solid. Newcomers to the group can't go in wrong in starting with The Greatest Hits, a generous sampling of sixteen of their most well known offerings.Hard-core Avalon fans already in possession of the groups previous hit-filled compendium -Testify to Love: The Very Best of Avalon will find a large amount of overlap between the two discs. As a newcomer to the group myself, each song is fresh and previously unheard, but loner time fans will find only five tracks difference from the previous collection. In fact, the tracks that were recorded specifically for The Very Best of Avalon such as \"New Day,\" and \"Everything to Me\" have been taken from that disc directly into this one.Still, dedicated fans may be able to justify the purchase. A new song, \"Still My God,\" proves to be a real tearjerker, highlighting God's unchanging nature through our trials and challenges. The last four tracks on the disc: \"All,\" \"You Were There,\" \"Orphans of God,\" and \"In Christ Alone\" have been swapped in from previous albums.\"Orphans of God\" is a particularly moving inclusion from Stand - a symphonic, tender song of reassurance that celebrates God's unending grace. \"All\" is a somewhat more two-dimensional tune, exhibiting a bounty, R&B influence. \"You Were There\" is an introspective, mellow song with a surprisingly forceful chorus.\"In Christ Alone\" draws from the vein that is ever popular amongst CCM artists - covering traditional hymns with their own distinctive arrangements. A beautiful rendition, Avalon's take on the hymn features heart-plucking harmonies, big, bold vocalizations, and poignant guitar accompaniment in the simpler sections that bursts into an array of strong percussion back up during the chorus.The classics that were previously included in the last greatest hits collection are clearly appearing again for a reason. \"Testify to Love\" is an addictive headliner that pops into my head throughout the day and demands to be sung. \"Knockin' On Heavens Door\" proves itself as a perennial favourite on account of it's chorus that depicts the insistent, never-ending prayers of a believer confident in her position as a child of God.Personally, I could have passed on \"Give It Up\" from the oldies but goodies section of the disc - somewhere between the heavy reliance on synthesizers and the embellishing \"na na na's\" I tune out. Likewise the dance-style rhythms of \"Wonder Why\" generally leave me cold. \"New Day\" rounds out the trio of tunes that I wouldn't have missed if they'd been left out of the compilation.There are some true Avalon classics included that make the album. \"Take You At Your Word\" is an insanely catchy, upbeat song that catches me every time and finds me belting out the chorus at full volume. \"Can't Live a Day\" makes me cry more often than not as I'm reminded of my complete dependence on Jesus, \"The Glory\" is a story song that recalls Jesus' life and sacrifice, and \"Adonai\" is a slow song with understated accompaniment that nonetheless a heart-rending cry to the creator.I'll admit that at first listen, the music struck me as somewhat fluffy, but after repeated listening many of these songs have become woven into my life. I've come to appreciate their theologically sound, yet still entertaining perspective (not always present in CCM), the variety of represented moods, and the clear vocal abilities of the group's performers.Avalon: The Greatest Hits is indeed a highly pleasing album that provides not only an enjoyable listening experience, but one that leads its audience into an interactive state of worship. I'd be hard pressed to number the times the songs I initially viewed as simple have led me to tears of repentance and rejoicing. This resulting emotional response and turning towards God in a listener should be the highest praise an album can receive.\n", "val": 0.02117733471095562}

{"text": "Avalon is a group that I want to succeed. Despite their past accomplishments, this is not a given. A lot has changed in the music world since their heyday. It's not only distribution, but boundaries between secular and sacred continue to come down. Advances in technology have produced innovative music and better sounding recordings, but quality craftsmanship is paramount regardless of genre.Avalon's recent years have seen a number of personnel changes, and lately, it seems like they have been casting about to find the right songs. Rather than reinventing themselves, it might be wise if the group focused on what has been one of their biggest assets--tight vocal harmonies. If they could combine that with a timeless sound, maybe something a little more organic (the change in Point of Grace comes to mind), and fresh songwriting, they might enjoy a resurgence.Strong songs have also always been essential given the obvious talent of all the different members and veteran producers like Charlie Peacock and Brown Bannister.The older songs, which make up the majority of this release, are the strongest, even though they now sound a little dated and cliched. I'm sure that others, like me, miss the presence of Michael Passons, one of the founding members. Songs that feature him are among my favorites.One of them, \"Give It Up,\" still moves me with its dreamy soundscape and the unmistakable touch of Charlie Peacock.This release is a little curious. Testify to Love: The Very Best of Avalon, which came out in 2003, has many of the same songs. One notable omission from this track listing is \"Always Have, Always Will.\"This CD has the advantage of including songs from The Creed (2004), Stand (2006), and Faith: A Hymns Collection (2006) but nothing from Another Time, Another Place: Timeless Christian Classics (2008).One bonus is the inclusion of \"Still My God,\" a new recording featuring the most recent member, Jeremi Richardson. He sounds great with a voice that reminds me a little of Michael Tait (dc Talk).As Jana Long, the only remaining original member, says in the liner notes, \"One thing has never changed ... our desire to sing about Jesus Christ and the difference He has made in our lives.\" With that as a focus, and the right songs and production, Avalon can continue to influence others.\n", "val": 0.01544975396245718}

{"text": "First time on CD, this cardboard sleeve album looks exactly like the authentic LP, only miniature in sizes. It also comes with a foldout poster of the original David Cassidy handwritten liner notes, the original band-photo embroidered paper sleeve, a plastic sleeve which houses the disc and a booklet in Japanese with English lyrics. The CD itself is remastered with K2 24bit Mastering Technology. The sound is warm, crispy clear and dynamic.The RCA albums, or the Da-idy records as known to David Cassidy fans, were the ones with which he tried to establish himself as serious musician in the industry. The Beach Boys' Bruce Johnston who co-produced and involved with these albums once said that with these albums David was taking next step. His half-brother Shaun also commented, \"The albums David did with Bruce Johnston are the best record he ever made.\" He explained, \"[they] feel true to him...for the first time, he was allowed to push the boundaries and...it felt like he was doing exactly what he wanted to do.\"Unlike the previous \"The Higher They Climb, The Harder They Fall\" which is more of a tongue-in-cheek theme album, \"Home Is Where The Heart Is\" is more of a \"band record\". Not only it is evidential in the inner sleeve and paper sleeve photos, but revealed forthrightly through the dynamic interaction among the band members and the raw energy from the recorded materials. Surrounded himself by Bruce Johnston, the America's Gerry Beckley and musician friends such as Bill House, David Cassidy experimented with his voice as well as music style. Maybe it is not far-fetched to say that the approach was not unlike those of Rod Stewart and the Faces or Paul McCartney and the Wings, since the latter's \"Tomorrow\" was covered here.I enjoyed this album tremendously. Bruce Johnston who said that artistically he preferred \"Home Is Where the Heart Is\" to \"The Higher They Climb\" confirms my feeling. Maybe this is the reason why, in comparing with the other two RCA releases, this album has more songs being selected in the earlier Razor and Tie compilation \"When I was a Rock `n' Roll Star\". True, there are only four tunes ( \"A Fool in Love\", \"Run and Hide\", \"Goodbye Blues\" and \"Bedtime\" ) which have not been available in the CD format previously and that content-wise, the running time is barely over half an hour, but the whole album is so worthwhile owning with its meticulous packaging and its original glory.I would like to end the review with quotes. Bill House said, \" [Home Is Where The Heart Is] is a good record...It's better than The Higher They Climb, The Harder They Fall...David was more in control of what he was trying to do.\" Bruce Johnston said, \"I thought what David wanted to bring to the table was really cool...It was about making music that mattered...He was as good as any major artist I ever heard or worked with, [although] some people weren't ready to accept that David had a lot of depth in his artistry.\"Well, 33 years has since gone by, are you ready?Track ListOn FireDamned If This Ain't LoveJanuaryA Fool in LoveTomorrowBreakin' Down AgainRun and HideTake This HeartGoodbye BluesBedtimeUPDATE: ORDERING TIPSWhile amazon.com finally stocks this Japanese import, it is asking for an outrageous 55 dollars!

{"text": "You always wonder if a veteran metal band will meet expectations on a new album. More often than not, they don't. The new stuff always seems to be missing something. It just doesn't grab you like the older material did. Well, I'm happy to report that's not a problem here. On Walk Through Fire, Raven serves up a magnificent blend of classic hard rock and heavy metal that manages to be both catchy and headbanging. If at any point in your life you liked Raven, this is more of the music that you liked. It's the maniacal, over-the-top, heavy, fun, ambitious rock that made Raven a crowd favorite back in the day.As I write this, Amazon shows no track listing, so I'll give it here:1. Intro2. Against The Grain3. Breaking You Down4. Under Your Radar5. Walk Through Fire6. Bulldozer7. Long Day's Journey8. Trainwreck9. Grip10. Running Around In Circles11. Hard Road12. Armageddon13. Attitude14. Necessary Evil (Bonus track - Japan Only)15. Space Station #5 (Cover Of The Montrose Classic!)The opener, Against The Grain, is dynamite. Think \"Speed of the Reflex\" meets \"Faster than the Speed of the Light.\" It's a furious, hair-raising anthem. Other standout songs include Breaking You Down, the title track, Bulldozer (with a bass solo!), and Attitude. But they're all good, especially the cover of Space Station #5. They have that same NWOBHM sound that we all went crazy for back in the 80s. Raven know what the fans want and they come through big time.This is currently being sold only in Japan. I bought mine from cdJapan. But it's cheaper there ($40) than the $80 currently being asked for on Amazon by resellers. If you can get it, I strongly suggest picking up a first print edition. It includes the excellent bonus track (Necessary Evil), a glossy 4\"x4\" Walk Through Fire sticker, and a nice article insert (though it's written in Japanese).I've had this CD for a little over three months now and it's getting constantly play. I ripped the songs, threw 'em on my iPod, and crank 'em wherever I go. I suggest you do the same. This is a superb album and a must-own for any serious metal fan.\n", "val": 0.00608976511284709}
{"text": "I do NOT know how I didn't know about Jeanne Robertson before last June.  She's been making people laugh for a few years now, and I thought I knew all the comediennes who claim \"The Andy Griffith Show\" as their favorite television program.There are a few things you should know about Mrs. Robertson:1. She is tall: 6'2\"2. She was Miss North Carolina a few years ago3. She is just plain fall down on the floor laughing until the tears are streaming down your face funny.4. Perhaps most amazingly: she accomplishes her routines with squeaky-clean language. You wouldn't hesitate to play her recordings for dear old Aunt Martha - in fact, you'd listen and think \"I can't WAIT until Aunt Martha hears THIS!\"She has an easy-going style that is not puffed up at all, and not hesitant to poke gentle barbs at herself, her family members, and people in the audience.  One of my favorite bits from this performance pokes fun at her father's pride at being the father of Miss North Carolina.I'll go ahead and add a disclaimer:I heard Mrs. Robertson on the Sirius Radio network and couldn't wait to buy one of her recordings. (My first was \"Flat Out Funny: Live at the Paramount\") I wrote an Amazon review that was unsolicited and I had not qualms whatsoever giving it my highest recommendation.  I'm an American Serviceman stationed overseas.  I received an email from Mrs. Robertson offering to ship me CDs or DVDs.  I wrote her back to say I'd be honored and offering to pay for them - after all, I'm only in the military, not prison.  She wrote back to say \"You're money's no good here, Sailor.\" Less than a week later I received a box with all six of her DVDs, every one of them signed.So I want to add to the above list:5.  She is a doggone nice lady.If you're looking for ANY kind of comedy - you can't do better than Jeanne Robertson.

{"text": "Years ago, when I was listening to K-LOVE a lot I heard Kari Jobe and immediately loved her music. At the time, the song \"Steady My Heart\" from her album \"Where I Find You\" was the newest single and I couldn't stop listening to it! I was going through some tough times and that song always helped soothe me. The last few years I've been busy raising my twins so I haven't consistently listened to music and only recently have I started listening to more music. I love to sing and listening to music that I both love and that's easy to sing along with is perfect for me because I always feel more relaxed, uplifted and happier afterwards. For the last several weeks, I've been listening to Kari Jobe's music nonstop because she is one of my favorite Christian artists and her music is beautiful. I'm very grateful to Amazon Prime for allowing me to listen to this album!\"Kari Jobe\" is Jobe's debut album and it is absolutely wonderful! There are 12 songs and the album lasts about 54 minutes in length. The product description states this album is considered Christian Contemporary and I agree with that because all of the songs are filled with praising God with a contemporary feel, using many musical instruments. Every song is so full of meaning and I can't help but sing along. I enjoy every song but would say my favorites are \"Healer\" (I could listen to this song over and over!), \"Beautiful,\" \"Singing Over Me,\" \"Sweep Me Away,\" and \"Revelation Song,\" the latter of which has been sung by many artists.I LOVE this album, along with the album \"Where I Find You\" and I am eager for her newest album \"The Garden\" to come out soon! I've been listening to her music for several hours a day and it fills me with such joy and peacefulness. I love listening to her beautiful voice and find myself singing along with her at times. The other reason I love her music so much, and most Christian music, is that it's safe for my four-year-old twins to listen to and I don't have to worry about them hearing anything they shouldn't. If you enjoy any of Kari Jobe's music, I highly recommend this album!\n", "val": 0.038762155920267105}

{"text": "I'm not sure that I can live up to the eloquent words that others before me have written in their reviews of Wendy and Lisa's latest CD, however, I compare it to several bottles of fine wine - each song with their own flavor, body, and lingering.  The girls' years of playing and growing musically really shows in this latest CD.  From their years with The Revolution to playing and collaborating with such artists as Seal, Sheryl Crow, Grace Jones, and countless others shows that these two are not afraid to try new flavors.  Most music today is of one mold and after a while really gets boring.  I would think this would lead to burnout for a musician as they are constantly worried what the record companies want and the one time that they want to stretch themselves musically, they could be dropped like a hot potato or not enough money funneled to promoting.  Wendy and Lisa did this latest CD on their own so they didn't have to worry about pleasing corporate suits and just had to let the emotions in the music flow.This CD goes from a glass of Chenin or Sauvignon Blanc, to a Cabernet or Merlot and back again.  You be the judge of what \"flavor\" each song is for you but you can hear the fine aging and care that went into each.  If you love many different types of wine or rather music, you won't be disappointed as this CD is truly a treat for the senses.\n", "val": 0.006969204172492027}
{"text": "This is an excellent album from two music insiders at the top of their game.  They've done a little bit of something for loads of artists up and down the dial (Gwen Stefani, OK Go, Lucinda Williams, Sheryl Crow, Grace Jones) and a whole lot of something for a privileged few (Prince, Seal, Neil Finn) while always doing their own thing on the side.  And after a 10 year hiatus (with thanks to last year's writers strike), doing their own thing turned into a top rate album that shows just what they can do.  White Flags of Winter Chimneys is trip from ethereal moodiness into rip-roaring rock with visits to 70's CA singer songwriters and a touch of glam.  It sounds like quite a mish-mash, but these funky chicks know how to brew it just right.  It reminds you of something you've heard before, but you can't put your finger on it because there's always that little twist to make it all brand new.  And as the stellar nine-minute opus Sweet Suite says, \"here we go beginning at the end.\" Listen to this album and love it!!!\n", "val": 0.03634778782725334}
{"text": "In their 2 decade plus solo career as a duo, Wendy & Lisa seem to have no end, only a new beginning with every wonderful work. They've played, written & produced with dozens of artists (if you've listened to almost anything musical since 1987, you've probably heard their work or influence). They've responsible for award winning Film & TV scoring including the NBC hits \"Heroes\" and \"Crossing Jordan\", along with the upcoming \"Nurse Jackie\" for Showtime, and \"Virtuality\".  Most artists who've reached this level in their careers would be content to continue on auto pilot into the sunset, but not these two. Thanks in part to last year's Writer's Strike, the pair found time to give a wonderful gift to the fans & admirers who have eagerly awaited a new release.  \"White Flags of Winter Chimneys\", the duo's fifth album, is a mature, living, breathing work of art; a masterpiece that simile, superlatives & metaphor only scratch the surface in describing. Words are all I have here, so here we go.Moving beyond their prominent & very influential roles as \"the girls in the band\" of Prince's Revolution in the mid 80's, Wendy & Lisa have proven themselves time & again to be masters of both their artistry & their craft; \"Musician's Musicians\" with a resume that reads like a who's who of late 20th Century musical legends & innovators (BB King, Eric Clapton, Seal, K.D. Lang, Pearl Jam, Rob Thomas, Nerina Pallot, Lucinda Williams, Sheryl Crow, Michael Penn, & Neil Finn, to name a few).  Wendy Melvoin & Lisa Coleman have succeed in transforming life & loss, heartache & hope into a tangible force. Sound that is solid in it's texture & weight, fluid in it's rhythm & depth, and as essential as air, meant to be taken in as nourishment for the soul.This is the second album the two have released on their own, the first being 1998's \"Girl Bros\", which dealt with the loss of their brother, Jonathan Melvoin, along with the evolving complexities of their own relationship. 10 years later, \"White Flags\" finds the ladies able to reflect on breakup without jaded bitterness, even when exploring that manic, ego driven conceit as it flows through the song \"Invisible\".  With a sound of Orbison meeting Lennon somewhere between the ballroom and CBGB's, \"Invisible\" shifts emotions, time signatures & personage with expert ease. \"Those years were mine, and I made us greater than our time...No light's are on you now, that is unless I'm near...Shine Shine  Shine ..Like when you were mine\" Wendy purrs & declares. Is there cause for purple suspicion here? Is this a reflection one finds in the mirror? Perhaps both.  Before \"Invisible\" showcases Melvoin's vocal bite & prowess as a one woman rhythm section, we're wrapped in the womb of the equally Lennonesque album opener, \"Balloon\".  \"Nestle near a willing ear...\" the pair breathes, as Lisa's warm, reverberant vocals & keyboards envelop & soothe. \"Here in my balloon, nothing's ever scary...\" The seeds of this song in particular may have been planted during Lisa's pregnancy with her now 2 year old daughter.  Spanning chaos & creation in just two tracks with 7 more, equally powerful gems to go, the album flows in a moody atmospheric mode, but is never maudlin or dull. It's impossible to be dull with rockers like \"Salt & Cherries\", which manages to name check the seminal group MC5 & serves as the most sexually charged song the duo has released to date. This track is where the racing chase pulse of \"Akira\" meets the femme-noir seduction of \"Bound\".  The ping pong of lead vocals duties between the two on the first half of the album is a subtle but beautifully crafted decision, one of many throughout. The duo, both mothers, carry the birth allusion to its conclusion as Lisa sweeps us through the undertow water break of \"Niagara Falls\" (Fans who purchased the album directly from their website can listen to the early demo of \"Niagara Falls\" and witness it in its beautiful, quiet embryonic form).What's most amazing on the surface is that the dense and rich sounds of the album are played entirely by Wendy & Lisa. However longtime fans have come to expect this from these two master multi-instrumentalists, who in their own words play \"anything as long as we can get a tone out of it\" \"Suite Sweet\", the final track of the regular release (there are 4 bonus tracks on the digital download version available exclusively at [....]) displays pure craftsmanship in the shaping of art & inspiration. Evoking Aaron Copeland, Kate Bush, The Cocteau Twins, Radiohead, Jane Sibbery, & Joni Mitchell (whose 1976 song \"Hejira\" provides the album's title), the nearly 9 minute \"Suite\" is exactly that. The composition cycles from sparseness and delicate, damaged lyrical emotion, to swell into a instrumental reprise of \"Balloon\" in theme & variation. Piano & guitar then soar in an electric tidal wave of sound, coming to rest as stately & quietly as it began.It's almost impossible to pick a \"favorite\", because every song is just that good. Other standout moments include \"Red Bike\" with a Neapolitan melody that is the precious fine china of memories, fragile & forever treasured; and \"You & I\" which features some of Wendy's most beautiful vocal & acoustic work to date, wrapped in gorgeous electric sonics. Lyrically, \"You & I\" echoes the Yin/Yang themes of birth & death, resignation & renewal, that form the album's emotional motif.The entire album has a rich, symphonic, cinematic feel, certainly bearing the influence of their scoring work of late. What has to be noted is that Wendy & Lisa have always created, or shifted, the feeling, mood & atmosphere of anything & everything they've blessed with their talents. Theirs is a rare gift, & \"White Flags of Winter Chimneys\" is the gift that will never stop giving. Try it & see for yourself.\n", "val": 0.024703191593289375}
{"text": "So - how does one introduce Wendy & Lisa?Former members of Prince's Revolution? True. Secret musical Illuminati? Definitely, if you count working with everyone from Seal to Soul Coughing, the Revolution to Bill Rieflin, Joni Mitchell to MeShell Ndegeocello, not to mention lil side projects with folks like Eric Clapton and Erykah Badu.You may think you don't know them, but you know their music. Seal's \"Kiss From a Rose,\" comes on the radio? Singing along to k. d. lang's Invincible Summer? Watching Heroes and getting creeped out by the magnificent score? Yep - you're soaking in it.I'm one of those geeky fans that likes all that. But I'm ultimately more interested in evolution than Revolution - which is why their albums as Wendy & Lisa are so intriguing to me. The first three albums emerged in a rapid post-Revolution fire of Wendy & Lisa (1987), Fruit at the Bottom (which, released in 1989, ought to be their \"Mortified\" entry), and Eroica (1990) -- the latter of which neatly presaged everything that you'd hear in every Lilith Fair artist in the wake of its release, but was released just too early for its time. Due to some mix-ups with producer Trevor Horn, and the shelving of the 1994 (so called) Friendly Fire recordings, another album wasn't released until 1998.And that's when true evolution began. Released in the wake of Jonathan Melvoin's overdose (while on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins), 1998's Girl Bros. is a self-produced song cycle of love and loss - more raw, minimally produced, and mature than the labels were willing to put out previously.After ten years of scoring and sidework, Wendy & Lisa have finally released a new album. And this one is . . . dare I say, evolved? Digging deep into the dirt of life -- including the breakup of their own romnatic relationship -- Wendy & Lisa have released an album that brings together their immense musical talents with a strong, solid knack for songwriting. The last few years of scoring (particularly on Crossing Jordan and Heroes) have translated into a strong new talent for narrative songwriting. More than any of their previous work, White Flags of Winter Chimneys is written as a full arc, opening with the tender, warm \"Balloon,\" carrying through the summer punk of \"Salt & Cherries [MC5]\" and \"Niagra Falls\" and then slowly back again in a cycle of loss to the almost-but-not-quite-shark-jumping orchestral \"Sweet Suite\".Beautiful. Mature. Thought provoking. Evolved. Words can't recommend it highly enough.\n", "val": 0.008995610289275646}
{"text": "It ceases to amaze me that Wendy and Lisa is still not being given the recognition they completely deserve.Yes, they are the women from Prince's Revolution.  However, more impotently these women need to be seen outside of Prince's shadow.They are both incredibly talented musicians who can write music outside of the notes, chords, and time signatures. They are not formula churning musicians and never have been.Wendy and Lisa create musical textures. Textures you can feel and embrace.  Their music has a way of pulling you in, and wanting more.  They are always looking for different tones, textures and ways of creating embracing layers to bring the listener into the experience.Wendy and Lisa are the most versatile artists I have ever encountered.  They have released five albums, none of which sound anything like the other, yet still carry a similar intangible theme throughout each of them.White Flags of Winter Chimneys is an album which to me carries atmospheric themed melodies augmented by rich layers of pianos, keyboards, vocals, acoustic and electric guitars.  The rhythmic and percussive layers create an additional depth of steadiness to help keep the listener grounded while listening to the hypnotic melodies.This album also has songs which makes your want to roll down your windows to let all around you hear!You will be carried through all the raw emotions of love lost, defiance, perseverance, forgiveness and love found.\n", "val": 0.014611653052270412}
{"text": "There is an old adage that states: \"Good things come to those who wait\". This adage is only half-correct in describing my White Flags of Winter Chimneys experience.  I HAVE waited patiently for the past 10 years for a new Wendy and Lisa album.  However, my patience was rewarded not with something merely `good' but rather with a musical experience that was truly `GREAT'.  White Flags of Winter Chimneys marks the 5th album release by the dynamic musical duo Wendy and Lisa.White Flags of Winter Chimneys takes the listener on a journey through balloon rides, break-ups, yearning, anticipation, down Niagra Falls, and ends back at the beginning. Beautifully made, this album features some of Wendy and Lisa's best work to date.One of the best qualities of White Flags lies in its unpredictability.  The opening song `Balloon' is a dreamy ballad, sung by Lisa Coleman, with melodies as seemingly buoyant as the balloon described in the lyrics.  The next song, `Invisible', is the antithesis of `Balloon'.  The softly sung light-hearted lyrics of Lisa during `Balloon' are replaced by the angry, boastful disparagements sung by Wendy Melvoin during `Invisible'.  Throughout the album, Wendy and Lisa expertly oscillate not only between music tempo but also between lead singing duties.  This album features the greatest number of songs lead-sung by Lisa Coleman to date.  Despite the fluctuating tempos/lead changes, Wendy and Lisa skillfully segue from one song to the other so that the album does not `feel' like a series of disconnected songs, rather, the album `feels' like one continuous musical journey.In addition to the awesome song transitions, the album contains the complex multi-layered melodies that are a testament to their superb musicianship.  Songs such as `Niagra Falls' and `Sweet Suite (Beginning at the End)' keep you guessing as to how many instruments are being played, what they are, and where Wendy's guitar ends and Lisa's `grunge' guitar sounding keyboarding begins.Highlights of the album include `Salt N Cherries (MC5)'; an explosive rock anthem that is sure to get some part of your body moving, `You and I'; a captivating acoustic piece with incredible lyrical imagery, and `Sweet Suite (Beginning at the End)'; a song that features heart-breaking lyrics about missing a former love that breaks into an equally heart-breaking instrumental.Listening to White Flags of Winter Chimneys is like looking into a beautiful seashell; you can spend hours analyzing its multi-layered patterns, its rich and complex color schemes, and its overlapping textures - only to realize that you have barely scratched the surface of its beauty.  This album is truly a `must have' for Wendy and Lisa fans as well as fans of great music!\n", "val": 0.017294341698288918}
{"text": "As with most of the reviews posted here,I agree that the newest Wendy and Lisa release is an exceptional musical journey that has been well worth the wait. After only a few listens(use a good pair of \"cans\" to listen to and really apppreciate the artistry,and song arrangements),it's become impossible to pick out a favorite song. IN FACT EVERY SONG IS DOWN RIGHT INCREDIBLE, in and by itself! Wendy and Lisa continue to amaze me with their musical masterpieces, and I think this is their best release yet(and that's real hard to pick one of their albums over another,they're all so good). If there is one song on this album to turn someone on to it has to be \"Sweet Suite(Beginning At The End)\", which is Lisa's keyboard tour-de-force. I also think that \"Salt and Cherries(MC5)\",deserves to be on every radio station and MP-3 player in the country! Enjoy this album and then go tell everyone you know in the your world, that Wendy and Lisa are really THIS GOOD!\n", "val": 0.031118476763367653}

It has really been worth the wait, I always kind of thought that after the \"Girl Bros\" CD I would hear no more, apart from your fantastic scoring work, so I was blown away by this release.Can't pick a favourite at the moment, although Balloon, Invisible, Red Bike and the title track are all up there!Thanks again for making me so happy - oh, and forgot to mention that W&L's involvement with Prince's \"Planet Earth\" CD made it a whole lot better album than it would have been otherwise.....go figure ;-PThanks again to all involved, and especially for the super-quick delivery time - I think there was only about four or five days from actually ordering it to receiving it, considering I live in Scotland I was WELL impressed!Love to allNeil (a fan of many years)xxx\n", "val": 0.0015529381344094872}
{"text": "There is an old adage that states: \"Good things come to those who wait\". This adage is only half-correct in describing my White Flags of Winter Chimneys experience. I HAVE waited patiently for the past 10 years for a new Wendy and Lisa album. However, my patience was rewarded not with something merely `good' but rather with a musical experience that was truly `GREAT'. White Flags of Winter Chimneys marks the 5th album release by the dynamic musical duo Wendy and Lisa.White Flags of Winter Chimneys takes the listener on a journey through balloon rides, break-ups, yearning, anticipation, down Niagra Falls, and ends back at the beginning. Beautifully made, this album features some of Wendy and Lisa's best work to date.One of the best qualities of White Flags lies in its unpredictability. The opening song `Balloon' is a dreamy ballad, sung by Lisa Coleman, with melodies as seemingly buoyant as the balloon described in the lyrics. The next song, `Invisible', is the antithesis of `Balloon'. The softly sung light-hearted lyrics of Lisa during `Balloon' are replaced by the angry, boastful disparagements sung by Wendy Melvoin during `Invisible'.

I am old enough to have a vinyl collection, and have seen a great deal of this medium growing up, but never have I seen such a radiating piece of artwork.  Every detail imaginable for a vinyl has been considered for \"White Flags of Winter Chimneys\".The weight of this plate is a DJ's dream there is no chance of warping with this 180 gram baby.Wendy and Lisa are not only serious about their music and production; they are also serious about the release of the product's medium.

{"text": "It ceases to amaze me that Wendy and Lisa are still not being given the recognition they completely deserve.Yes, they are the women from Prince's Revolution. However, more impotently these women need to be seen outside of Prince's shadow.They are both incredibly talented musicians who can write music outside of the notes, chords, and time signatures. They are not formula churning musicians and never have been.Wendy and Lisa create musical textures. Textures you can feel and embrace. Their music has a way of pulling you in, and wanting more. They are always looking for different tones, textures and ways of creating embracing layers to bring the listener into the experience.Wendy and Lisa are the most versatile artists I have ever encountered. They have released five albums, none of which sound anything like the other, yet still carry a similar intangible theme throughout each of them.White Flags of Winter Chimneys is an album which to me carries atmospheric themed melodies augmented by rich layers of pianos, keyboards, vocals, acoustic and electric guitars. The rhythmic and percussive layers create an additional depth of steadiness to help keep the listener grounded while listening to the hypnotic melodies.This album also has songs which makes your want to roll down your windows to let all around you hear!You will be carried through all the raw emotions of love lost, defiance, perseverance, forgiveness and love found.\n", "val": 0.02078850381076336}

{"text": "In today's \"music digital age\" it is rare for artists to look beyond the music and pay attention to the packaging of the product as well.  In the not-too-distant past, album covers and album artwork could garner more excitement and admiration than the music contained within.  When so many people merely download music from the internet, it is easy to forget that music used to be, not solely an audible experience, but a visual one as well.  For those of us old enough to remember, we would sit around the record player and marvel at the exquisite artwork on the album cover and relish in the lyrics and liner notes inside the gatefold.  Listening to an album was truly a multisensory experience that is coming closer to extinction with each digital download.Fortunately, Wendy & Lisa have reminded us what a beautiful multisensory experience music can be with the release of the LP version of their most recent album, `White Flags of Winter Chimneys'.  This is simply an amazingly beautiful album that should be a collector's item for all lovers of good music and of good craftsmanship.  First, the album is 100% Virgin Vinyl and weighs in between 180 and 200 grams!  The greater weight ensures better durability, feel, and stability on the turntable.  Second, the album itself is absolutely gorgeous (the pictures above only convey a fraction of the album's true beauty)!  The record is a beautiful color splatter of white, blue, and black that mirrors the feel of the cover and inside artwork.  The album art was done by the famous graphic designer Rex Ray.  The cover features a beautiful photograph of a hand (not a glove) that has been fractured by light.The album is a GATEFOLD that also features a Rex Ray photograph on the inside-left of the gatefold as well as the song lyrics on the inside-right of the gatefold.  The album sleeve mirrors the cover art except there is a picture of Wendy & Lisa in the forefront.  The back of the album sleeve contains the album credits and liner notes written by Lisa Coleman. The liner notes are very honest and sensitive and explain what Wendy & Lisa have been through since the making of their last album (Girl Bros.) as well as how this wonderful opportunity to make another album came to fruition.It is obvious that Wendy & Lisa took special care to create this album, both musically and physically.  The vinyl, artwork, and liner notes all prove that Wendy & Lisa are not solely concerned about making good music.  Unlike other artists, they look beyond the music in order to give fans an experience that is pleasing to the ears, to the eyes, to the mind, to the heart, and to the soul.If your purchase this album, you will not be getting only an amazing piece of art in the form of beautifully crafted Virgin Vinyl.  Rather, you will also be getting amazing and brilliant music.White Flags of Winter Chimneys takes the listener on a journey through balloon rides, break-ups, yearning, anticipation, down Niagra Falls, and ends back at the beginning. Beautifully made, this album features some of Wendy and Lisa's best work to date.

{"text": "For me, White Flags of Winter Chimneys was an exciting and hotly anticipated music release. After hearing Balloon and Invisible - two tracks from their new album - I was intrigued by their musical direction. As a long time fan taking a crash course in Wendy and Lisa's music, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect with the new album other than an alternative/rock feel. I'd dropped any preconceived notions that Wendy and Lisa needed to sound like The Revolution era long ago, and I was musically open and receptive to what they were doing now. Even though I was still playing catch up at the time, I had a gut instinct that White Flags of Winter Chimneys would be a musical experience to behold. I was glad my instincts were right.I can still remember my reaction upon listening to White Flags of Winter Chimneys from beginning to end. I felt like I'd heard one of the best albums of 2008...hands down. Over the years, I've come to expect albums to have four good-great singles, maybe a couple of alright-good songs, and \"bloatware\" to fill out the rest of the space on an album. It's rare to find albums in this music age where I can listen to every single track and not feel inclined to skip to the next track. White Flags of Winter Chimneys is one of those albums that keeps your finger away from the fast forward button. If anything, it keeps your finger on the rewind button to hear a track again and again and again.White Flags of Winter Chimneys takes me on a haunting yet ethereal journey every time I listen to it. I take off slowly with the opening track, Balloon, ascend quickly to the stratosphere with tracks like Red Bike and Salt & Cherries (MC5), and land gently back down on Earth with Sweet Suite (Beginning at the End).As I mentioned earlier, Wendy and Lisa's new album has an overall alternative/rock theme to it, but it also subtly touches on their musical past (i.e. the bonus track The Dream) and musical present as film/TV scorers (i.e. the beautiful epic Sweet Suite [Beginning at the End]). Just when I think I have nailed down a song (or few) that's my favorite, my ears find something new to love about another song. While I have my standout tracks that I play regularly - Balloon, Red Bike, Salt & Cherries (MC5), Waiting for Coffee, and Sweet Suite (Beginning at the End) - I truly love the entire album.Ever since I downloaded White Flags of Winter Chimneys, it has been on regular rotation. Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman have clearly taken the time to craft quality music with their new album. In fact, it's clear that time has only made them a finely tuned music machine. Together, Wendy and Lisa crafted a musical masterpiece in White Flags of Winter Chimneys that is an experience, not just an album.\n", "val": 0.02514832839369774}

I was blown away by their innovative playing, such as dual drum sets, screaming into guitar pickups, choreographed full-band drum performances, and a drum and bass solo with three people playing the bass: one playing the strings with mallets while two others work the fretboard.  It was truly a unique experience, and I was so impressed by their innovative style, that I immediately rushed out to purchase their CDs so I could support them.I was doubly lucky in that their CDs are awesome.

{"text": "For those of you put off by their last album, Potemkin City Limits, fear not. I really disliked the sound of Limits, but it was, without a doubt, their most mature entry at the same.Supporting Caste brings back the classic feel of Propagandhi along with the most thought-provoking lyrics I've heard in quite a few years.A great album if you're into politically/socially charged punk/thrash/metal. Propagandhi has found the fine line between social commentary and preaching. And they aren't preachers.\n", "val": 0.03040677309036255}
{"text": "Propagandhi's new album was the greatest experience in music since I got into the Beatles, since not even the Beatles music has made me hold back tears. Yes, you read that right, read it over again. Nothing has impressed me as much as this did on a first listen. If you've never heard \"Potemkin City Limits,\" this will probably take you a few listens to get in to. Potemkin took me a few listens and \"Supporting Caste\" takes this sound further. Chris Hannah's guitar work is as impressive as always, and \"the beavers\" guitar work doesn't detract from Hannah's at all, which was definitely something I worried about. I feel as if I could've played \"Potemkin City Limits\" and \"Less Talk, More Rock,\" in front of my mom and it wouldn't bother her, \"Supporting Caste\" would need some more tolerance and understanding, though not as much as \"How To Clean Everything.\"The album starts out with the incredible \"Night Letters,\" which starts out with Propagandhi's most metal moment ever. I wouldn't have even realized it were them until the Todd starts singing and the song explodes in all its thrashy gloriness. For those STILL hoping for another \"How To Clean Everything,\" you won't find it here, and really should've stopped expecting HTCE 2 after hearing \"Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes.\" Either way, I almost feel like this album was made for me. \"The Banger's Embrace,\" is a great song that brilliantly contrasts the darker feel of most of the album, with a more upbeat sound and positive vibes. I'm assuming this is what Chris was referring to in saying this album mixes PTC with \"Less Talk, More Rock.\" The song's is especially effective after following up the incredibly thrashy \"Incalculable Effects.\" \"Dear Coaches Corner,\" is probably my favorite of the slower, more melodic songs on here. It's been stuck in my head constantly from the 2nd listen. The way he sings the opening words \"Dear Ron Mclean, dear coaches corner,\" are sure to not leave your head. For the fans of the short and fast songs, which has sort of been a tradition since \"Less Talk, More Rock,\" \"This Is Your Life,\" won't disappoint. I do kind of wish Chris would sing one of the short ones though (Who doesn't like \"Rio de San Atlanta, Manitoba?!\"). \"Come to The Sabbat,\" is an interesting hidden cover track at the end of \"Last Will & Testament\", that is a very unusual sound for Propagandhi, albeit a cover. It'd definitely be a fun sing-a-long live song. The only other gripe I have with this album is that I loved \"Bringer of Greater Things,\" and \"Cut Into the Earth\" on PCL, but Todd's songs on these ones are much thrashier and I like the way he sings, it was surprising after his performance on Today's Empires. The lyrics on this album are less political overall, but that certainly doesn't mean they've lost their edge, the lyrics are intelligent as ever- still very impressive. The insert is jam packed with notes from Chris and links to organizations and causes, plus some quotes (including a frightening one from Hermann Goering, Hitlers 2nd in command, which you will immediately identify as happening today).Bottom line is if you're a metalhead who likes punk at all, get this album. If you're really into punk rock and like thrash at all, you'll love this album as well. If I had to sum up this album in 2 words it'd be \"thrashy\" and \"epic.\" I wouldn't call any track on this album filler but standout tracks would have to be \"Night Letters,\" \"Supporting Caste,\" \"Human(e) Meat (The Flensing of Sander Katz),\" \"Incalcuable Effects,\" then the rest of the album less then a step behind.\n", "val": 0.01271398551762104}
{"text": "Hmm, where to start with this album?...I've been a Propagandhi fan since I first started listening to music when I was 15 and How to Clean Everything was easily one of my very favorite ablums.  Gradually as I grew older and my taste evolved and matured I had stopped listening to them as well as similar sounding types of music.  Years later, I think I was drawn to this album because of the artwork when I happened to come across it in the store and decided to try and 'rekindle'.  Although it took time, I have started to listen to it more and more and have recently been blown away over and over as I realized what a brilliant album this is.  The musicianship and songwriting is second to none.  The guitar arrangemetns are highly original and technical.  The sound is tight, crisp and extremely well-delivered.

{"text": "I'm a late arriver to Propagandhi's party and the group's brand of socially conscious music and message. First album I got was \"Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes,\" in early 2006, and it killed--and it's a STEAL at the $7.98 Amazon price. I followed up with \"Potemkin City Limits,\" \"How To Clean Everything,\" and I'm gettin' ready to download Propagandhi's digital-only \"The Recovered EP.\" Really enjoying the vibes, but I digress...I kinda lost touch with the group, though, and only recently discovered the \"Supporting Caste\" release. I've been way late to this party, and have been listening to it nonstop since receiving it. A one word review would be, \"WOW!\" But where's the fun in that?I suspect there are those Propagandhi backers who'll see this latest release as too commercial musically or, maybe even, a sellout. But I'd just ask any of them to consider how the group's evolved from its punk/thrash roots to a more sharp-edged metal sound. Frankly, I think the messages Propagandhi communicates fit better in a metal framework, especially considering the level of technical virtuosity--which is outstanding. While the lyrics are as focused as ever, the music demonstrates maturity gained through years of touring, evolving, and adapting to the changing landscape.This is music with a message that deserves to capture a whole new generation of kids and young adults. Older adults, too (I'm 56). What I hear throughout the group's music catalog is \"Think for yourself. Don't believe everything you're told.\" You know: Be more informed, not more opinionated. Sound advice for any generation, especially in today's hyper-polarized and politicized atmosphere.In conclusion, this is some great effing music and Propagandhi's strongest album yet.

Everyone hating on Bush made him easy writing material, and bands such as Green Day out of nowhere decided they wanted to take part in it.Propagandhi is beyond \"mainstream politics\". You won't find a song they've written to simply be about the popular \"I hate Bush!\", \"The Government sucks!\" mentality.  No, they've dedicated their lives to learning about the world, and how dark and truly awful a lot of it is.

You may have to move beyond your genre-based biases, which are foolish to begin with, which say that pop punk, old school hardcore, and thrash metal are somehow 'less musical' in their content.  Less musical than what?  Black Sabbath? Pink Floyd?  Perhaps.  But perhaps not.  I, in fact, would argue for the latter.The Canadian gents of Propagandhi, spearheaded over the years by vocalist and guitarist Chris Hannah, use relatively short (usually 3-4 minutes) but intricately arranged  bursts of sonic energy to cover a wide range of progressive political and social topics.  It should be noted that the members of the band are involved in a number of causes ranging from womens' rights and racial bigotry to contemporary issues in Haiti.  Fueled by a dual guitar attack that walks a line between NOFX's seminal brand of 'pop' punk and Anthrax's era of thrash greatness in the 1980s, 'Supporting Caste' offers twelve tracks of thoughtfully conceived loud, fast and heavy music, with plenty of dynamics, of course.  Hannah's inspired, impassioned, and key-conscious vocals carry the bulk of the album while The Rod's gruff and furious vocal attack opens the album and makes two other welcome appearances.The production is top notch, thanks as always to the engineers at Blasting Room studios. The balance between guitars, bass, drums and vocals is perfect.  Given the speed and ferocity with which the band rips through each track, the productive clarity heard on the record is all the more impressive.  Canadian artist Kent Monkman lends his painting skills to the band to great effect.  An orgy of Native Americans and white men, some dressed in animal skin and all more or less nude, takes place in Yosemite Valley, perfectly setting the tone for Propagandhi's culturally, politically, and historically subversive take on modern life in the capitalist west.If you take nothing else away from this review, remember this: With \"Supporting Caste\" Propagandhi has crafted a truly phenomenal piece of music.  Musical genres are socially constructed illusions that narrow our minds and prevent us from seeing that greatness can be achieved in all forms and styles. Music, and art in general--and Propagandhi is indeed art--is whatever we make it, and the dudes in Propagandhi have made it something great.\n", "val": 0.020553238689899445}
{"text": "Propagandhi exceeded my expectations with this one, and in my opinion, this is their best album to date.  As always, it's not cookie cutter stuff, like Pennywise (who I don't dislike, but you get the point), and your enjoyment of the album will be immensely magnified if you look into what they are talking about.  I'll try to leave out my personal views and actually review the album, but just so you know the last three books I've read are by Dawkins, Hitchens and Bob Torres.  :)\"Night Letters\" starts the album off with a metal sound, with Todd's vocal's following.  You're not sure what to think but after a couple listens, it's pretty darn good, and the best Todd track to date, imo.The title track is up next and it is definitely worthy of being a title track.  In trademark fashion, Chris once again let's us know he's not part of this machine and we shouldn't be either.  It's musical blueprint is similar to \"A Speculative Fiction,\" but it's a nice improvement.\"Tertium Non Datur\" can be strictly summed up with \"rigid dichotomies\" and a plea, of sorts, to not fall into that trap.  It is a faster track and I'd say this is where Prop is at their best but every sound they attempt on this album is done well.Next up, \"Dear Coach's Corner,\" where Chris reads a letter (it's more exciting than that): here's one I really relate to because I go to a lot of sporting events.  Do we really need a giant flag on the field, Marines marching with their rifles, blue angels flying over the stadium, and a general performing the coin toss?  Unnecessary propaganda overload.\"This is Your Life\" is a Todd track that would fit on any of the last 3 albums, which is not a bad thing at all.\"Human(e) Meat\" is the catchiest song.  I wasn't aware of Sandor Katz prior to this song.  Substituting Michael Pollan would have made the theme even easier to recognize, but Katz is an effective sacrifice.\"Potemkin City Limits\" is next and is beautifully written: \"When the screaming began, Francis shut his eyes and felt the hand of inhumanity brush over him.\" \"Where for 5 months he ran free and replayed his only fond memory, just a warm and distant dream of his mother's loving eyes upon him.\"  Wonderful imagery and I may or may not have shed a tear for Francis.\"The Funeral Procession\" as well as \"Last Will and Testament\" are both great and basically say don't wait for someone else to work for the change you want to see.  Anyone can relate to the next track \"Without Love,\" and it may be one my favorite Propagandhi songs ever.To sum it up, \"Supporting Caste\" is a continuation of the sound from Potemkin City Limits (album), but while it was hard for me to get into PCL, Supporting Caste is a great achievement for the band.  This is the point where many bands decline, but Propagandhi are at their peak.  So if you were put-off by PCL, give them another chance and buy the album because this is one of the few casts worth supporting! (I'm not sorry for the bad pun)\n", "val": 0.014318369328975677}

{"text": "THE GREAT ESCAPE left us with indelible images, characters, dialogue and music. This film contains one of Elmer Bernstein's most recognizable themes in cinema history: the main title or \"The Great Escape March\" as it is often referred to. To say that THE GREAT ESCAPE has such a distinction is an understatement. His main title theme is as much a tribute to the Allied prisoners in the film as it is to all men who must overcome the odds through their own perseverance and unwillingness to bend to defeat to whatever noble end they strive for. Bernstein's complex score complements the theme by giving us passages and statements on the diversity of the individuals as well as their singular overall objective. Once the Allied escapees are on the road, the music reaches exhilarating proportions unlike that of traditional action Hollywood scoring. Bernstein wants to put the audience through the same suspense and anticipation that the escapees feel and then unleashes our pent up emotions in a crescendo of rousing orchestrations that has us cheering them on. That was the same brilliant technique he employed in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. I don't think many people give Elmer Berstein the credit for being the musical innovator that he was back in this period of his prestigious career. Composer Bernstein was able to control our emotions giving us moments of reflective tranquility, then despair and in the next moment lifting our spirits again knowing that actions were not taken in vain and good will eventually prevail. This is an excellent 3 CD album of all the music.\n", "val": 0.02652939036488533}

{"text": "This three-disc release contains both the original 33 minutes of re-recorded music found on the LP issued when The Great Escape was first released in 1963 and the complete score as recorded for the actual movie soundtrack, the master tapes of the latter having been found in recent years. Both have been available in other editions, but this is the first combined release of the two. There's also a booklet which give a nice, short history of the film's genesis and production. The 1963 album disc gives a nice concise musical impression of the film. The two-disc original soundtrack is of course a much longer slog, but Elmer Bernstein's music flows almost seamlessly from one segment to the next, giving it a nice sense of unity, and as you'd expect the main title march and variations on it appear now and then, also tying the sections together nicely. Those tracks are mostly pretty short, on the order of a minute an a half each, but as I just said the overall effect is not centrifugal -- indeed, some I suppose might consider it repetitious. Those fearful of that last reaction might prefer to opt for the one-disc album of the original LP instead. Either way, fire up that motorcycle and let's let Steve McQueen hop on.\n", "val": 0.012945194728672504}

{"text": "As my obsession with Lady Gaga grows (I never in a million years thought I'd ever utter those words) I find myself covered in glee as I discover these `Cherrytree Sessions' here.  So far I've picked up two (this and Robyn's, both exceptional).  If you want to get a different taste of three tracks off `The Fame', then this is a great buy!The Piano and Voice version of `Poker Face' is outstanding, and if you've seen her play this live on any of her many television appearances then most likely you've heard at least the intro to this version, for she usually opens `Poker Face' on the piano.  It's weird to think that the girl who lavishly dropped `Just Dance' on the unsuspecting public is actually talented, but OMG she really is, and this track is one of many that proves it.Some have balked at the inclusion of the Stripped Down version of `Just Dance'.  It's funny that the song that makes you famous actually becomes your Achilles Heal over time.  This is one of her weakest tracks on `The Fame', but I actually like what she does with it here.  Sure, it doesn't really feel `stripped' down (I would have loved to hear this over an acoustic guitar) but it works, and the short running time is a bonus.  Regardless, her voice is very good, and it shows.The biggest surprise for me came with the Electric Piano and Human Beat Box version of `Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)', namely because I really didn't like the original version of this song on `The Fame' and actually really LOVE what she does with it here.  It has so much character and her vocals are stellar and the song that once appeared bland and boring springs to life with a beat boxing background that calls to mind Justin Timberlake's `Rock Your Body' (the closing, obviously).  It was such a pleasant surprise to actually be taken aback by the way she recreated this track and delivered something superior and enticing.So, this is a tiny little bundle, but it's worth it for any fan of La'Gaga, and who isn't a fan?\n", "val": 0.02001919038593769}

{"text": "Alaniss fifth studio album offers a wide range of potent relationship songs, both positive and negative. The majority of the album revolves around her past relationships, what they meant to her and how they have affected her.The album beings with 21 Things I Want In A Lover which is lists 21 of the many qualities Alanis hopes to find in her partner. She explains in the song, I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter. With the albums second track, Narcissus, Alanis dives into the negative qualities of her past lovers. Hands Clean releases a highly kept secret between Alanis and a lover she had when she was very young. One of the albums most repetitive tracks, Flinch, details how much Alanis is affected by her lovers, but at the same time hopes she will grow out of it; Soon Ill grow up and I won't even Flinch at your name. So Unsexy explains how her lovers have the ability to make her feel thirteen again and just as the song is titled, so unsexy. Precious Illusions lists all of the illusions that surround relationships, like not feeling complete unless shes in a relationship. But essentially, Precious Illusions reveals that Alanis was previously rarely happy unless she was in a relationship. In That Particular Time Alanis recalls a failed relationship in which her partner gave up long before she did, while she was busy trying to her best to squeeze love from him. Alanis takes a very honorable stance in You Owe Me Nothing In Return by proclaiming that no matter how much she puts into a relationship, her lover should not feel like they owe her anything in return. Surrender is a thank you to someone who perused Alanis, no matter the stereotypes that surround her. She explains how much she appreciates this person and how glad she is that they surrendered to her. The two tracks that do not focus on relationships are A Man and Utopia. In A Man Alanis puts herself in a mans shoes and realizes that they go through just as much as women do. And in the albums last track, Utopia,  Alanis recites what makes her feel at peace.Under Rug Swept is an amazingly brilliant follow up to Alanis last studio album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. This album quenches the thirst of Alanis more avid fans, but the general listener should not be expecting anything similar to her previous releases. What Under Rug Swept lacks are the religion and society questioning songs that supported Jagged Little Pill and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie so well.  Alanis recorded roughly twenty-five songs for this record and left the majority of the songs under rug swept. You can however get your hands on some of these more thought provoking songs via the secret site that you gain access to by inserting the CD into your computer, as well as by ordering the Hands Clean singles.\n", "val": 0.016022130846977234}
{"text": "I completely disagree with the Amazon review, especially the part about Alanis' work being self-obsessed.  With each CD Alanis comes out with, there are songs which I feel she wrote for me, so close is she to my own thoughts and feelings.  She strikes a chord with many of us.  What woman has not been faced with at least one \"Narcissus\".  Who among us wouldn't want to be a good enough person to live along the lines of \"You Owe Me Nothing in Return\".  I was drawn to Alasis from the first time I heard \"Hand in my Pocket\" due to the lyrics she writes.  I do not find her turns of phrase awkward, I find them powerful.  Alanis knows how to turn language around to fit her manner of communication, and that's what powerful language is all about.No other artist has touched me the way Alanis has.  And she has certainly not disappointed me with this new CD, which I have been listening to for about a month now thanks to Amazon's pre-order digital library.

{"text": "First to review. Quite appropriate as I just finished listening to the Alanis last effort. I got it in the mail today. I was very excited about it and I was not let down...Alanis has grown musically and personally. If you liked JLP, you will like this. If you liked SFIJ you will like this, but expect a somewhat more cheerful mood. She is more accessible now than in SFIJ.There are more catchy songs than in SFIJ and Alanis writes all the music for the first time and she is good at it. Lyrically...well it's Alanis. If you like psychoanalysis, introspective reflections and complicated words to define the most basic emotions, you will love it. Unlike SFIJ, you can listen to this album without much reflection and still enjoy it, but you would benefit immensely from a all-around listening of lyrics as well as music.If you never listened to Alanis before (and were on Mars when \"You Oughta Know came\" out...:0) you will like this if you listen to pop with a slight rock edge music. If you are a long-time Alanis fan you won't be disappointed. She delivers as expected with surprisingly a VERY good songwriting talent too. I was somewhat sceptic about her songwriting attempt, but was happily surprised. I write songs too and tend to be crtical of myself and others. :0)If you like Hands Clean, you won't be let down by the album.Personally I appreciate how spirituality influences her music and it's one more reason for me to give it 5 stars.Favourite tracks: Hands Clean, Utopia,Precious Illusions, and othersLess favourite tracks: Narcissus, A Man\n", "val": 0.06044449284672737}
{"text": "Her grammar aside (or is it a Canadian thing?), Alanis has recovered from a supposed sophomore slump to put together a solid third album. The opening power chords of \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\" come like a sneak attack and serve notice that some of the vitriol we hadn't really seen since \"You Oughtta Know\" is back. The first single, \"Hands Clean\" sounds like another smack at the man we first saw in \"You Oughtta Know\" (someone please tell me its not really Dave Coulier again) but the melody and personal angst really shine. My personal fave is \"So Unsexy\" which artfully combines a hip-hopesque beat with a crunching guitar line. Whatever record company exec called this album \"unlistenable\" needs to go back to releasing NSync records and let Alanis do what she does best - write confessional lyrics that occassionally make you go \"I've felt like that\" and mix them with interesting, original musical arrangements.\n", "val": 0.01110665500164032}
{"text": "\"Under Rug Swept\", Alanis Morissettes 3rd release, does not quite live up to the singer/songwriter's past efforts (not including the candy-pop of her early Canadian stardom, of course) while still being an above average listen. Those who tell you it's very close to her smash '95 debut, \"Jagged Little Pill\", mean mainly that it deals with same themes (boyfriends, boyfriends, boyfriends) and that it lacks all the eastern sound layers and context that were ample in her 2nd album, 98's \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\". Other than that, URS is an entity all in its own right, for good or bad (mainly the latter).Don't get me wrong, Alanis knows a thing or two about making music, but still, to me, the only truly wonderful song in URS is Flinch, both lyrically and musically. It has a beautiful chorus, very emotional, the kind of emotion that's lacking muchly in this release. Even in the songwriting absent are the things that made Alanis so wonderful: the earnest confessions, the day-to-day imagery and original metaphors and semi-poetry. She used to write in a special stream of consciousness, one which amazingly enough flew and transmitted completely to the listener. Now the lyrics seem very clinical, very self-explained. Ordinary enough not to make you wonder what she really means. A big big loss. Also, Alanis' trademark disregard for structure rules is a bit too much here. Forced is the word that comes to mind.Musically, this is also a disappointment. The album is full of generic drums, glossy guitars, and expected synths. Nowhere to be found are the lovely harmonica segments, piano work (except for \"That Particular Time\", an out of place \"Candle In The Wind\" sound-alike that would've been more suitable as a b-side) or even her amateur flute from \"That I Would Be Good\". I didn't mind that it wasn't the most professional flute playing, but her daring to try won me over. Unfortunately, there are nearly no worth mentioning arrangements in this release whatsoever. Overly, it feels overproduced and too-pop-oriented, a result of Alanis' first try at producing. It's ironic that her former producer Glen Ballard, a mainstream pop guru who many hold to blame for ruining several rock bands, has actually stirred her in a rockier direction. Without him by her side, Alanis tends to go pop and the result is URS.Not a single song in here isn't radio-friendly (except for \"A Man\" perhaps). The edgiest stuff here are \"A Man\" and the opening track, \"21 Things\", but that also lacks something. Its too polished basically, and even the catchy power chords can't change that. After that comes the worst song in the album, \"Narcissus\", in which Alanis' voice goes simply annoying as she analyzes a self-absorbed ex-lover. The first single \"Hands Clean\" comes later, acoustic based and light, which doesn't quite sooth the subject matter (Alanis' affair with an older record company person as a teen), but overall, listenable. \"Flinch\" continues, being the standout track of the album (for listeners such a myself, at least), a delicate wonderful song, the kind that reminds me why I like Alanis so much. She uses her voice better than ever before in this one. And than, as if in spite, comes \"So Unsexy\", another terrible pop number with little actual substance and much fuss. Then follows a likely single, the very catchy \"Precious Illusions\", who could've been much better. Now comes the oddest of them all, the piano-based ballad \"That Particular Time\", that feels very much out of place and functions as the touchy-feely track of the album, I suppose. Doesnt do much for me. Than, the album's 2nd rocker, \"A Man\", a good concept gone mediocre. While Alanis' did this one very emotionally live, it feels lacking something in the studio version (which can be said about almost the entire album). \"You Owe Me Nothing\" is a weird, weird, weird track, filled with weird synths and drowning in psychobabble. \"Surrendering\", one of the more decent songs here, is about Alanis' current relationship, and it seems that if it weren't for the awkward structure of the song, it's could've been great. Once again, the lack of arrangements kills the potential of something much better. Closing the album is the serene \"Utopia\" which is beautiful in its own right, and was released months before the album as an internet single, in wake of the Sept. 11th events and in honor of its victims.This is not a bad album really, and in comparison to most [music] out there today, blond pop goddesses and metal/rap hybrids gone bad, this is a nice alternative. But nothing more than nice, Im afraid. URS cannot hold a candle to SFIJ, and it also seems Alanis' persona has shifted. Never mind angry, I'd settle for any authentic emotion at this point. I don't want healing tips and psychologic talk from Alanis, I want her truth, and that's never found in selfhelp guides. Some comfort can be found in the EP due to be released with all the tracks that didn't make it to URS, most of are better than the actual URS tracks (\"Sister Blister\" is a great rock song and \"Symptoms\" is the best new song Alanis has recorded alongside \"Flinch\"). Playing the songs live will hopefully give them the edge they are missing. Anyway, URS will probably do very well, better than SFIJ, and most people will enjoy it very much, but this just isn't good enough for people like myself, who adored the poetry and musicianship of SFIJ. Perhaps URS's layout, that bright blue background with stars and butterflies, suggests best what kind of audience this is meant for.\n", "val": 6.103364285081625e-05}

{"text": "Alanis Morissette's second major release (\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junky\") after her incredible \"Jagged Little Pill\" album was so overwhelmingly disappointing that it is barely remembered for its music -- but its bad reception.  But wise enough, Alanis ditched her previous producer and took on her new album, \"Under Rug Swept\", herself.  She succeeded in creating a rock album that is enjoyable and purely Alanis.\"Hands Clean\", the album's first single release, is almost \"You Oughta Know\" in nature: discussing the outcome a \"few years later\" after a harsh relationship break-up.  One of the album's more musically and lyrically strong points, the single is the perfect companiion to the album itself: it is poignant, darkly amusing and very emotional.Alanis' incredible talent with combining such odd lyrics to incredible music is once again shown beautifully.  \"so Unsexy\" remains a gorgeously written song with a vocabulary that one would've second guessed on at first.  \"Narcissus\" is also a great cut, combining Alanis' love for psychology with a ranting rave that reminds one of her \"All I Really Want\" cut from \"Jagged Little Pill\".\"Flinch\" is one of the album's ballads -- and one of its strongpoints as well.  Beautifully orchestrated with acoustic plucks and soft electric backgrounds, it sooths the listener and shows the talent of Alanis' vocals.  One line, \"Are you my blood? / You touch me like you are my blood\", echoes eerily.  \"That Particular Time\" is also a ballad, and remains much in essence of vocals and simple piano coordinating.  A wonderful track.Overall, Alanis has come back with an album that is what her older fans feel is \"real Alanis\": rock out, brutal lyrics, and that voice that is so recognizable and unheard anywhere else.  \"Under Rug Swept\", I feel, will not be swept under at all -- we can leave \"Fatuation Junky\" under that rug.\n", "val": 0.042317382991313934}

Flinch has to be one of the finest songs of the period: pulsing with energy, caustic yet soothing; this song itself has to be the gem that completes the transition from Jagged Pill's subway high school diva to Central Park grown-up lover.  I liken Under Rug Swept to the great album Four by Blues Travelor.  Both of these become richer and more relevant as each playback completes.

{"text": "When i first heard Alanis Morissette, it was in 1995 when \"You Oughta Know\" played on the radio.  My first reaction to Morissette and \"You Oughta Know\" was not positive - it was \"what is this, why is this woman so angry, and what is this chip on her shoulder?\"  Most of the \"bubble gum\" and synth-pop of the 1980s was beginning to fade, yet Morissette's anger just seemed too raw for me to absorb at the time. However as the subsequent singles from Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill\" album were released, I soon began to see more than an angry young woman.  When I listened to \"Jagged Little Pill\" in its entirety, I realized that this album lived up to all of the hype.  Not only did this album garner critical acclaim, but it was one of the best selling albums of all-time.  When there is a monster album, expectations are usually through the roof for a follow-up album, and while Morissette's \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" was still a very good album and sold well, many considered it a disappointment.  Artists that usually have a \"sophomore\" slump have a difficult time with their third album sales. Morissette's third effort, \"Under Rug Swept\" wouldn't sell as well as \"Jagged Little Pill\", but from a quality standpoint, it would not disappoint.When one produces a legendary album like \"Jagged Little Pill\", one faces a crossroads - \"play it safe and do the same thing\" or \"explore new avenues\".  To Morissette's credit, she changed her act with \"Junkie\" as she made a more personal and \"darker\" sounding experimental album that instead of angst took a more reconciliatory tone.  With \"Under Rug Swept\", the tone reflects Alanis' maturity as she takes a more \"diplomatic\" way to lash out her anger.There are three big changes to note on this album.  This is the first album without her producer Glen Ballard.  Ballard served as Morissette's songwriter and producer on the first two albums.  Now Morissette takes production and songwriting into her own hands - in other words, assuming complete control.  Sometimes an artist needs an outsider to serve as a \"devil's advocate\".  While Morissette does a very good job in her new \"solo\" duties, I think this album could have benefited from Ballard playing \"devil's advocate\".The second change has to do with Morissette's voice.  The raspy and screeching voice found on \"Jagged Little Pill\" is all but gone - again reflecting maturity by Morissette.  The third change is that Morissette drops her trademark harmonica for \"Under Rug Swept\", but she continues to pick up more instrumentation as she did on \"Junkie\" - this time the guitar.Here is a quick synopsis of the tracks:\"21 Things That I Want in a Lover\": This song reflects Alanis' maturity in the way she \"lashes out\" by describing 'not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer' in her lover.  This track contains some excellent guitar work.\"Narcissus\": Flea has a guest appearance playing bass, but I wouldn't say this is a song that gives a legendary bassist like Flea a chance to shine.  This track has Morissette demonstrating the vocal ranges found on \"Jagged Little Pill\".  This song also shows maturity in the way Morissette \"lashes out\".\"Hands Clean\": Awesome track.  Morissette's vocals are the driving force of this track.  Her vocals allow here to deliver a song that seems personal.  The song seems to chronicle a relationship Morissette had with an older man.  Apparently the relationship needed to be kept quiet.\"Flinch\": A softer song, once again Morissette takes her vocals and makes them the driving force. Her vocals are passionate and not raspy and that is what it needs to deliver the message.  In this song Morissette faced losing a lover, but once again doesn't \"lash out\" like she did on her \"Jagged Little Pill\" days. Great track\"So Unsexy\": Another great track.  Alanis faces rejection again on this track and with her maturity, she once again doesn't \"lash out\".  While this is a \"slower\" track, there is some terrific hard guitar in this song.  Morissette's vocals once again deliver a passionate message.\"Precious Illusions\":  This song opens with more of the Indian music influence that Morissette incorporated on \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\".  This is another terrific track.  Morissette  shows her maturity referring to \"The Ring\" and \"The Pill\" on this track yet talks about those long-lasting effects of her \"precious illusions\" she had as a kid.\"That Particular Time\": A very slow track, it gives Morissette a chance to shine.  Morissette describes another relationship that didn't work.  Once again, Morissette doesn't lash out, but deals with things in a more conciliatory tone\"A Man\": This song also has a bit of an Indian influence.  From the title, Morissette sings this song from the perspective of someone who is a man - describing the emotions a man might feel.\"You Owe Me Nothing in Return\": This song has a bit of a R&B/funk feel to it.  Morissette takes her conciliatory tone as she sings lines such as \"you can also for space for yourself and only yourself and I will grant it\".\"Surrendering\": This is the best track of the collection.  This track also has a bit of a funk groove to it.  This song is almost the antithesis of \"Jagged Little Pill's \" \"Not the Doctor\". \"Not the Doctor\" dealt with Alanis' frustration with a weaker man.  On this track, Alanis seems impressed with the man who has it all together.  Alanis' vocals are awesome.\"Utopia\": A folk-like song.  Alanis sings about her vision of \"Utopia\".  The instrumentation provides the power on this song.  Alanis sings in a higher octave giving this song a good feel.The liner notes include all of the lyrics .  This album isn't like \"Jagged Little Pill\", but that doesn't mean it was a bad album.  In fact this album deserved Album of the Year consideration in 2002.  I'd highly recommend it.\n", "val": 0.009563210420310497}
{"text": "I had until very recently lost track of Alanis Morissette (and pop/rock in general) since her first three albums and would ordinarily see no point in adding my own review of a several-year-old album to the hundreds (412 at the moment) that have already been posted on this site, but having rediscovered how much I liked her music -- Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie and Under Rug Swept in particular -- I felt like writing a word or two.My attention was initially caught by Beth Massa's (professional reviewer) comment:\"The snag is that, as with her previous two albums, Under Rug Swept is marred by unabridged stream-of-consciousness lyrics. Her awkward syntax and distorted phrasing disorients music that's melodious and compelling. She remains acutely self-obsessed, delivering rants aimed at men who are fatally flawed and, naturally, irresistibly devastating.  For now, her greatest strength as a musician lies in her ear for a powerful melody.  Lyrically, she'd be better off keeping her contorted prose In Closet Locked\"This, I think, completely misses what is for me the core appeal of the best music on her first three albums: her raw honesty.  An honesty which more often than not cuts both ways.  I, obviously, have never had an interview with Alanis Morissette, but my feeling is that her \"stream-of-consciousness lyrics\", or free verse if you like, is nothing more than her communicating how she thinks and feels about an event or issue in the way most natural to her, and if her chosen words and phrasing happen to be displeasing to the style police why should she or anyone else give a tinker's damn?  Real honesty is rare enough in itself.  Intelligent, thoughtful, honesty is practically an endangered species in popular culture.  It seems to me that rewriting free verse that is honest and powerful (and a perfect match for the music in my opinion) into some sort of equivalent of iambic pentameter would be an ugly and insane triumph of form over substance.  And I will also add that she doesn't seem to be any more \"self-obsessed\" than anyone else I know.  How can anyone write a song about personal pain or anger without sounding self-obsessed anyway?  That fact that there may be bigger things going on in the wide world can give us some perspective but it won't make the pain go away.  Kurt Vonnegut once said something to the effect that all real literature was about the same thing:  Being a human being is a bummer.  This is vintage Vonnegut but the point is that the most meaningful art is about the pain, and confusion, and confounded fallibility of being human.  The best of Alanis Moressette's music (which includes most of the songs on this album) is certainly of this type.  What some have refered to as \"soul music\".  I will choose it over \"style\" music any day of the week.As evidenced by her first three albums Alanis Morissette is one of the best alternative pop/rock musicians out there both musically and lyrically. Jagged Little Pill was a great album.  Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, and Under Rug Swept are outstanding.\n", "val": 0.00028082329663448036}

Under Rug Swept marks her first self-produced effort and the result is one of the best CD's Morissette has released to date. Like JLP, Under Rug Swept offers a variety of emotions throughout, while each song seems to follow easily into the next, almost as if Morissette is writing about her continuing metaphysical journey filled with both the happiness and the heartaches of love and life. There isn't a bad song on this collection with memorable hooks and melodies. Lyrically, Morissette continues to write from her depths with feelings of deep reflection, overwhelming loss, and spiritual transformation. And like JLP, you'll finish listening to Under Rug Swept feeling like Morissette just wrote a personal chapter of your own life.\n", "val": 0.07347908616065979}
{"text": "Among all kind of reviews, I've always seen the song by song reviews as the most helpful ones. Im reviewing here an album that I heard more than 150 times, so I know what Im tellin here.NB : I am NOT a jagged-little-pill fan.1) 21 Things I want in a lover :A nice opening, with nice lyrics. And lyrics in this album are among the best in history. A rare wisedom. The song is more heavy in guitars, but fairly short. It is not the one that made me fall in love with the album. 7/102) Narcisous :Now here Alanis is talking to a spoiled boy she s in love with. Slightly less electric than the previous one, and less pleasing on the first time u listen to it. A little satiric, but very nice. Once again the lyrics are great. 8/103) Hands clean :It s where the words \"Under rug swept\" were taken from. Easy song and very pleasing on the first time u listen to. Very appealing. Much more acoustic than the two previous ones. I got the album for that song. And I never regretted it. U can see she s talking about the same guy. The lyrics in this album are a whole story. 8.5/104) Flinch :A 5-minutes acoustic song that s so beautiful. Less complaining and much more searching for the \"guy\" of the album. When u listen to album plenty of times (like 5, not 150), this one stays in ur mind. 8.5/105) So Unsexy :\"I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful\". The album is gaining beat again. A song to offer to the love of ur life when u feel \"Thirteen again, am I thirteen for good ?\". Alanis is a showing to be more a wise woman in the album. That s why Im sure she s no more selling. 8.5/106) Precious illusions :Another single (after hands clean), which means the song is catchy ! I love these comparaisons she do \"You'll rescue me right, in the exact same way they never did ?\" Upbeat and more electric :) 8.5/10AND HERE STARTS THE FABOULOUS PART :7) That particular time :A tale that describes the changes of a relation in 3 months before it s ended. The best Alanis Ballad. Wonderful lyrics and music. 4 great minutes. It s not the best song when u first listen to the album, but surely will be one of your favorites if u listen to the music from the \"ears in your heart\". The bridge in the song is one of my ever favorite ! 10/108) A Man :The album is getting way Better ! U ll like this song from the first time u ll listen to it. Great vocals, with a heavy-rock parts, yet not hard on ears at all. Here she trys to understand that selfish-narcisous guy. And she does it well, wearing his skin for once in this album. I can give it more than 10 so... 10/109) You owe me nothing in return :Such a soft song. Water like 5 minutes song. The lyrics are SO powerful, tender. It s the true concept of loving in a song. My ever-favorite Alanis song. I let u discover it. 10/1010) Surrendering :To end the story of this relation, she chooses it face 2 face, yet with a tendreness. I recommend the lyrics (as i will for the last song). The music in this song is distinctive and catchy. 10/1011) Utopia :Used to be my favorite in the beginning. I ll let u discover why on ur own. 10/10So such a wise album might take a couple of times to get to u. Anyway, I strongly recomment reading the lyrics while listening to the songs. If u like catchy and easy albums such as her \"Jagged Little Pill\", well run away !In the end I wish to do some recommendations, taken from the spirit of this album :Verspertine - Bjork (experimental has never been so wise)Lara Fabian - Lara Fabian (remember this name, her songs CANNOT be performed BUT by herself)Boys for Pele - Tori Amos (Rage + coldes pianos give such a wonderful way to throw away ur inside fires)\n", "val": 0.02078264206647873}
{"text": "I'd have to say, normally, I HATE writing negative reviews about artists who do have some actual talent. When I say talent, I mean the stuff thats very rare these days, and perhaps died a few decades ago. Because now of course, we live in the world of identical ''indie'' rockbands. If you don't like those, you can listen to people rapping about sex and hoes, and drugs and murder.  My point being, that I think Alanis does deserve to be famous. She deserves a stage, and an audience and the right to share her talent. My love-hate relationship with her has been around since the days of Jagged Little Pill. JLP blew big. So big, it blew any hope of her future records right out of the water. She's produced some okay stuff through-out the years, there's atleast one good song on each album. Under-rug swept however, really doesn't have very much to offer in the form of talent. You might get some brief enjoyment from songs such as ''precious illusions'' and ''hands clean'' if you enjoy ashlee-simpson style poppy guitar riffs.  If you're looking for the angry and fantastic young woman you found on jagged little pill, don't come any closer. She isn't here, and hasn't been for a long time. Alanis, is probably thrilled about this. She seems it. In songs such as ''you owe me nothing in return'' she elaborates in various different wordy-ways, her unconditional love for a current boyfriend. It's not so much the music that turns me off. The music is seemingly acceptable. But on albums such as this one you have to wonder how Alanis avoided the path fate had obviously carved for her. To become a therapist. Listening to this C.D is like sitting down for a session of psycho-therapy. It's not even music anymore because it's completey swamped by her desperate need to get sentences in that don't even fit with the chords she's playing! You find yourself ripping your hair out... no Alanis, THIS word would of sounded much better THERE!  I'd like to say there's some high points to this album, but my mother taught me not to lie. The lowest points however, can be found in the self-obsessive ''So unsexy'' the boring '' A man '' and the meaningless ''Surrendering''.\n", "val": 0.00022343262389767915}

{"text": "I own some of Alanis albums; This one (Under Rug Swept), Jagged Little Pill and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. I personaly think Jagged little pill is really not that good as a lot of her others. It is very overrated. Under Rug Swept however, seems just very underrated. The album just has a lot of nice tunes, and alanis voice seems more mature and layed back. Lyrically, this album is less selfish and more mature than any of her previous efforts.The opener, 21 things I want in a lover, is the rockiest track on the album and I listened to it a lot. The next track, Narcissus, made me laugh, as she is singing 'I know you had your butt licked by your mother', it just spontanously made me laugh. I like the way Alanis expressed how she felt in this track. The chorus has a lack of power though, which makes the song one of the weaker tracks on the album. 'Hands Clean' however, makes up for the lack of power in the previous track. This is the catchiest and maybe best track on the album. You probably won't notice the next track on first listen, but after a few listens, this has got to be a favorite, at least lyrically. It works the other way around on 'So Unsexy'; this is one of the tracks that will catch your eye (or should I say ear?) first, but the catchy-ness of this track and the lyrics fade after 3-4 listens. Precious illusions is the best track after Hands Clean. Check out the video it is kind of fun. That Particulair Time is a slow track, not much to say about it, excpept for the fact that it is good. It's a slow song. So is Utupia by the way, but the best slow song on this album is without a doubt 'You Owe Me Nothing In Return'. A muture track that will get your attention at first listen.Wheter you agree with me that this album is better than Jagged Little Pill or not, Under Rug Swept is definatly worth buying. It is lyrically mature, and there are enough catchy, strong tracks.\n", "val": 0.009732688777148724}

Don't be put off by Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie's not so hot reviews, it wasn't well received, but 'Under Rug Swept' in in some ways a back to basics album with great melodies, thought provoking lyrics that make u smile with recognition of having the same thoughts and feelings in your own past relationships.

The album attempted to move Morissette away from her debut album's dance-pop sound. However, Now Is The Time sold less than half the number of copies of her debut album, and Morissette lost her recording contract with MCA Records.(wikipedia.org)So Jagged Little Pill (1995) was Alanis Morissette's third studio outing, making \"S.F.I.J.\" 4th and \"U.R.S.\" 5th and \"S.C.C.\" 6th unless you count \"F.O.S.\" which would be 6th making \"S.C.C.\" 7th\n", "val": 0.00729709817096591}

Say what you will about her contorted lyrics and grating syntax, but you can't fault her for making the words go down nice and easy with some awfully compelling musical textures.  On the gorgeously acoustic \"Flinch\" Morisette bemoans her inability to shake the memory of an old flame, while \"So Unsexy\" is lit up with a hip hop beat and a killer chorus.  \"21 Things I Want in a Lover\" features an exploding guitar riff that makes you almost forgive the shoehorning of such awkward lyrics as \"are you funny?/  la self-deprecating?\".

I feel like I'm growing up with Alanis.  When she was an angry young woman, I was at that stage in my life.  Now, she has gained a sense of herself ... it's refreshing.  This album is about accepting who you are and being OK with that.  It's about putting the pain of past relationships in perspective.  It's about living your life and being in control of your own happiness (such as recognizing you have a choice as to who you let effect your life and for how long.  You have the choice what relationships you enter and when you leave).  I think the lyrics are beautiful and very insightful for a woman her age.  The album is empowering, not because it puts men in there place liked Jagged Little Pill but because it is more about finding your place as a woman.  If you like thought provoking music and are in a different place in your life than you were when enjoying Alanis' early men bashing days, you should like this CD.\n", "val": 0.07805648446083069}
{"text": "Alanis is so back!!!For fans of Alanis Morissette, it's been a relatively quiet four years or so following the release of the ambitious and challenging Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. This album was considered a disappointment after the \"Thriller\"-esque hugeness of its predecessor, the breakout Jagged Little Pill. There was a very good and stunningly underrated Unplugged disc -- which showed just how gorgeous some of the SFIJ songs were when stripped of their sonic-assault trappings. But still we waited, hoping but perhaps not believing Alanis would return to the accessibility, tunefulness and power of JLP. Well, with Under Rug Swept she has given us more than we had any right to hope for. This album (actually her fifth studio effort) is a tour de force, proof positive that Alanis Morissette is a genuine talent, an important figure in popular music. Criticism of her pop-psychology-inspired lyrics will abound, and I can't say it's not justified. As far as her delivery goes, her fans LIKE the way she phrases a line, and even find some of her pronunciational quirks (\"I von't keep on playing the victim...\" \"My brodder saw you...\") bearable, if not endearing. There have been times when even the most devoted fan had to cringe at her ultra-self-conscious writing and vocal stylings. On Under Rug Swept, though, those times are very, very few. The melodies, the arrangements -- the powerhouse bass playing on most of the tracks, for example -- and production (by Morissette) are top-flight. And there's the added bonus of Alanis's fabulous, wide-ranging, powerful and unique voice, an instrument which doesn't get nearly the recognition it deserves. The bottom line is that with Under Rug Swept, Alanis Morissette is back. Welcome!\n", "val": 0.006655802950263023}

{"text": "Alanis' 3rd studio album proves that she knows what she's doing.  An outstanding lyricist and a wonderful performer.  From start to finish, this album is something Alanis should be proud of.01.  21 Things I Want In A Lover - the opening track is one of the more rock songs.  It's a favourite of mine, Alanis describes things she would like in a lover 'are you funny?' etc.  5/502.  Narcissus - at first I didn't like the song because the vocals are a bit scured but after a couple of listens I really got into this song.  The lyrics are something females can relate to.  5/503.  Hands Clean - the first single off Under Rug Swept, a nice song sounding more like the stuff from SFIJ, good.  4.5/504.  Flinch - another song we can relate to.  I find this song really close to my heart, an excellent way of describing a relationship lost but still in your heart.  5/505.  So Unsexy - different lyrics, brilliant.  I love the way she describes herself in this song, 'I'm 13 again, am I 13 for good?' and so on.  5/506.  Precious Illusions - I love this song, the vocals are sexy and raw.  LOVE IT.  5/507.  That Particular Time - the worst song on the album, Alanis' vocals aren't up to her regular pitch and the music lags on and makes the song seem kind of boring.  2/508.  A Man - the music is hard again here, the lyrics are a little different (a woman saying she is a man) but it makes perfect sense.  Wonderful.  5/509.  You Owe Me Nothing In Return - another one of my favourites, a song about love and how your partner need not give you anything even if you give them everything.  5/510.  Surrendering - this song seems to disappear from memory but it's amazing.  I'm not sure why this isn't a stand out.  4/511.  Utopia - vocally and lyrically this is brilliant.

Her vocals are not as intruiging and extreme and it seems that her vocals are much more controlled than they used to be.. This to me has taken most of spark out of what i like her for in the first place. She seemed out of control and manic and that is what i loved about her. But Under Rug Swept is much more vocally manipulated to bring about a much more \"perfect\" vocal arrangement. \"21 things i want in a lover\" is a great opening track. its opens with aggressive guitar riffs and  manically driven drum beats. A repeat of \"All i really want\" you may ask..its not. her vocals are great but as i keep saying, they're so much more..sane.\"Narcissus\" opens with swirling guitar riffs and catchy drum beats with very well written lyrics which very nicely fit in with the rythm. It's a really groovy song and very nicely sung.\"A man\" is probably one of my favourites. we come back to her more manic roots and aggressive vocals \"And i have been shamed, and i have blamed\".\"I surrender\" a really nice song. great lyrics with no doubt very deep meanings  but again we can only wish she \"screamed\" them more rather than sung! you know, the old Alanis way!A good buy if what you are looking for is an album packed with great melodies, well written, and well produced songs.

Her American debut not only skyrocketed her to super stardom but also set a standard for rock music.\"You Oughta Know\" became the national anthem of heartbreak and \"Ironic\" showed us that no matter how many words there are in a lyric, Alanis can somehow manage to cram them all into one chorus.

However, the rest of the songs on this album do not carry the same lullaby sing-along feel.Alanis hits hard with songs such as \"Narcissus\" - a song that is basically a blame-rant at an egotist boy. \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\" is a dry opener with rigid lyrics.Morrisette than delves into self-consciousness on \"So Unsexy\" - which shows why she is a winning combination.Her witty verbalization and gushing of words explains the most simple, yet indescribable feelings every human encounters.What is different about this album is the fact that Alanis fully produced the whole record.\"Flinch\" opens the conversational balladry that usually pops in an Alanis record.The real melodic prize is in \"You Owe Me Nothing In Return.\" The song is good enough to be a single because of its catchiness, yet one can't tell if she is being sarcastic in her words or not - a filling treat.The album closes with \"Surrendering\" and an intricately arranged optimistic ballad \"Utopia\" showing that Alanis is a true gem.This album is not as angry and as straightforward as \"Jagged Little Pill\" nor is it as deep and dim as \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" but it is a more refined and complete rock record. \"Under Rug Swept\" will not produce a lot of hit songs, but will still stand as one of the best records of the year.\n", "val": 0.009473959915339947}

And the great thing about this album is that the top four songs were not released as singles. \"Hands Clean\" and \"Precious Illusions\" were good songs, but the top cuts on this album are \"A Man,\" \"21 Things,\" \"Narcissus,\" and \"Surrenduring.\" I highly reccomend this album because it is a major step not only in Alanis's career but in the pop rock world, as well.\n", "val": 0.009016532450914383}

I hesitated to buy it since I had not heard any of these songs before her concert here in Lima, Peru but after witnessing such talent, I picked one up and it is just spectacular work.  Her voice is at the best its ever been, original lyrics and the music production of the songs is very well done.  I have to say, after JLP that was great for her then in 1995, URS shows Alanis has certainly evolved; she has increased her creativity and each song has a story behind it without sounding repetitive. Highly creative album, has a certain consistent theme throughout.  You can play this cd day after day and not be tired of it.  HANDS CLAND, PRECIOUS ILLUSIONS, and SO UNSEXY are great singles.  And I heard THAT PARTICULAR TIME, a very raw song that takes you to the deepest of Alanis and shows her singing from somewhere you have maybe not heard her before.I CERTAINLY CERTAINLY CERTAINLY recommend this cd!\n", "val": 0.08386946469545364}

Who admits that she fell in love with alanis after Jagged little pill (mainly due to the 'you oughta know' song).Alanis is a mediocre singer at best, nowhere near the voice of talented canadian singers like Diana Krall or Celine Dion.  There are no songs on this cd which I would call a hit, no catchy melodies or memorable music.  At least here two previous cds had at least 2 catchy tunes each, this one has none....Alanis seems to have attached like gangrene to the plight of angry women who have been hurt by cruel men.  And those women are loyal and do not care if they can not sing along without a thesaurus.  Therefore it is irrelevant what I write about this cd....\n", "val": 2.673672861419618e-05}
{"text": "Smart, sassy, controversial, unapologetic, and thought provoking. Sounds like a recipe for success, doesn't it? And for this lady, it definitely is. Alanis Morissette is, quite simply, one of the greatest female musicians ever. So with all the attention her career has attracted over the past decade, it's hard to believe that one year ago - on the release of just her third record - Alanis had yet to reach her 28th birthday. With her ground-breaking 1995 debut, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" Alanis created one of the greatest female albums in history. The public seemed to think so too: almost 30 million copies were sold worldwide and it became the biggest selling female album of all time. With the follow-up, 1998's \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" expectations were high. Typically the public were not impressed, and Miss Morissette faded away from the music scene - until the dawn of 2002.With \"Under Rug Swept,\" her first album for almost half a decade, Alanis takes her musical style back to the Jagged Little Pill days. With this, she incorporates angry and confrontational lyrics with catchy melodies, and the results are truly remarkable. The album opens with \"21 Things I Want In A Lover,\" a loud and proud rock anthem in which Alanis declares the 21 things she prefers (but not necessarily needs) in a lover. The title of the song says it all really, and it's a stunning song to open the record with. \"Narcissus\" is definitely an album highlight. A fast-paced beat opens the song, and complements the tone perfectly. Alanis talks to a self-obsessed ex-lover, and goes through all the silly things about him. \"You go back to the women who will dance the dance. You go back to your friends who will lick your a**. You go back to ignoring all the rest of us. You go back to the centre of your universe.\" With a bass played by Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and a girl power theme, this is a truly incredible song. Lead single \"Hands Clean\" follows. Alanis incorporates a more poppy sound on this radio-friendly hit. She tells the story of a relationship she was in, where her lover was much older.\"Flinch\" is the album's centrepiece. At just over six minutes, the song is a swaying and epic ballad. Alanis recalls, yet again, a past relationship from more than one decade ago. In the bridge she sings, \"What are you, my blood? You touch me like you are my blood. What are you, my dad? You affect me like you are my dad.\" She sings this to melodic excellence and the chorus is equally satisfying. \"So Unsexy\" is another superb mid-tempo rock song. Alanis connects with angst-ridden teens by taking on the role of a 13-year-old who feels so unattractive and unhappy with herself. Auto-biographical, perhaps? \"Precious Illusions\" was the second single to be released from this fantastic album. Alanis talks frankly about precious illusions she had in her head before she became an international star - and that parting with the illusions is like parting with invisible friends. Weird lyrics, but still a brilliant song. \"That Particular Time\" and \"A Man\" are perhaps the low points of this album. The former is a peaceful, yet incredibly slow song which definitely holds the title of the sole true ballad on the album. The latter is a rock-charged anthem that just gets better as the song progresses, starting with a quirky and upbeat melody in which Alanis takes on the role of a man and sees things from his perspective. Interesting, but rather forgetful.\"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\" is phenomenally mind-blowing. I really love this song to absolute bits, and it's probably my favourite song on the album. The song is a mid-tempo song, with rather average vocals from Alanis. I'm not really sure, but I think that the song is about a lover that has obviously done Alanis wrong, and she's saying that he owes her nothing. He can ask to live by himself or with another lover and she'll grant it, and that she doesn't want anything to do with him - there are no strings attached, just as long as he gets out of her life. Alanis' vocals are extremely emotional and the song has a very mystical feel to it. A classic. \"Surrendering\" is a fantastic and pleasant mid-tempo song. Alanis has a great vocal range on this song, and the song has a cool beat that trips and falls all over the quirky arrangement to perk up the mood of the album. The final song on this album is \"Utopia.\" This song is very dreamy in which Alanis' vocals do gymnastics all over the arrangement! She sings some great lyrics such as, \"We would stay and respond and expand and include and allow and forgive and enjoy and evolve and discern and inquire and accept and admit and divulge and open and reach out and speak up.\" Her voice rises and falls to the syllables, resulting in a Hippy-type sound. Peace out, man!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10I was rather sceptical about buying Under Rug Swept. I loved Jagged Little Pill, and it's even my favourite album of all time. It's just that I was not very sure about buying this album. It's only when I saw it on sale that I thought I'd buy it. I'm so glad that I did. This album is truly remarkable, highly underrated and totally a future classic. Don't be afraid if you bought Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie and disliked it. This album is in a similar vein to Jagged Little Pill - and there can't be anyone who dislikes that! Buy it now, you'll be a fool to miss out!\n", "val": 0.05833009257912636}
{"text": "Alanis Morisette's first album, \"Jagged Little Pill\", was the zenith for affected, bitter female ranters.  It was one of the few albums where it was radio-worthy in spite of itself - the more obtuse the analogies were, the more intriguing a listen it became.Now, was \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" a misstep?  Perhaps from a commercial sense, but as an album it's surprisingly good - a mature collection of songs written from a place of self-awareness without being over the top.  And it took some chances musically that should've been applauded instead of reviled.Morisette's third effort, \"Under Rug Swept\", seems like an attempt to reconcile the commercial success of the first album with the creative growth illustrated in the second.  Unfortunately, it spends way too much time sounding like \"Jagged Little Pill 2 - The Sequel\" than an album onto itself.  Tracks like \"Hands Clean\", \"Flinch\" and \"That Particular Time\" sound like outtakes from her first album, to the point that \"Hands Clean\" goes over territory written about better in \"Right Through You.\"When the album is accessible (\"Precious Illusions\", \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\") it really goes no further than being radio-friendly alt-pop.  And when it's not, as in the ridiculous \"Utopia\", it's pretty much intolerable.\"Under Rug Swept\" seems like a compromise album written by someone under pressure from her record company to produce hits while not compromising artistic integrity.  Sadly, it appears she does neither in this case.\n", "val": 0.0005155507242307067}

Another standout is \"so unsexy\" - a fantastic tribute to her insecurites and \"how many little rejections can make her feel so unsexy\".

The fact is that it took her more than 3 years to release this shows us perhaps Alanid should try out other things then making albums.She get rids of Glen Ballard and writes and produced the album on her own which of course nothing wrong with that. But it shows she is new at this when listening to the album. The album lacks in brilliant hooks and good melodies and lyrically it is far from being amazing. She obviously has nothing more to say and repeats what she was singing about on her previous LP's which was slef - discovery and her bad luck with Men. This album is about finding men and love and it makes you think after listening to this album perhaps Alanis may have been a bit unfair to the guy she sang You Oughta Know about. When I come to think about it she is not a girl that I would like to date.Nice try Alanis but better luck next time. Hey wasn't she supposed to release two albums in 2002 but only released one.

{"text": "I was very, very excited to get this CD when it first came out, about a year ago.  It was very well hyped, and for weeks in the Delaware Valley, you couldn't go anywhere without hearing \"Hands Clean.\"  I was happy, and I was ignorant.  After listening to this CD just a few times, though, I shoved it back into its case and more or less forgot about it.Last night, I pulled it out, wondering why it wasn't in heavier rotation with my other Alanis CDs.  Well, it only took one more listening to remember why:Problem #1:  Alanis's voice here is more nasal and shrill here than on any of her other releases.  On \"Jagged Little Pill,\" she spent half her time screaming, so her voice didn't really matter...and on \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" she was just a few inflections away from the spoken-word.  Here, on \"Under Rug Swept,\" we find out the terrible truth--Alanis isn't a very good singer.  She has a great grunge-voice, and a nice growly whisper, but she isn't particularly suited to the pop-style singing heard here.Problem #2:  There's no growth here.  None.  She's whining about the same things here that she was whining about eight years ago.  The difference is that she was edgy and innovative then.  She *snarled* on \"Jagged Little Pill,\" with unforgettable lines like \"And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it.\"  Here, she writes a cutesy narcissistic song (from her \"You Oughtta Know\" lover's point of view) with a sweet, if grating melody, and off-kilter mainstream singing.  She wailed to ethnic beats with mournful songs like \"I Was Hoping\" and quirky tunes like \"So Pure.\"  On this, we have the bizarre and irrelevant \"A Man\" and the utterly obnoxious patronizing \"21 Things I Want In A Lover.\"Problem #3:  As mentioned by one of the reviewers above, Morisette's syntax has gotten so strange as to be nearly incomprehensible.  She adds and drops syllables to force the lyrics to match the tunes, and the end result is a mess. (I am a Tori Amos fan.  I know what I am talking about.) From \"Precious Illusions\": \"This ring will me yet as will you knight in shining armor/ This pill will help me yet as will these boys gone through like water\"Say what?Overall, it just seems like Alanis, for all her spiritual posturing, has just found herself a cozy little niche in teen angst, and will ride this pony for all it's worth.  I, for one, will hold out for something new and different.\n", "val": 4.8968395276460797e-05}

{"text": "Alanis has never failed to shock and thrill the listening public, but on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie it became clear that she would be happy unloading her thoughts on us wholesale over any riff that would stand under her lyrical weight. Either through the grace of God or the co-writing/production of Glen Ballard (or both), it overwhelmingly worked in its unorthodox way. However, on Under Rug Swept it has gone terribly out of control. It dominates almost every song, all of which sound unusually glossy when compared to Alanis's previous work. It's not that there's nothing wrong with turning from a critical darling (back) to a shimmery popstress, but i don't have to like it. Glen Ballard, where did you go?It isn't that Alanis Morissette's third American studio effort is terrible, it's just that it's unrefined... and it's hard not draw a connection from there to her suddenly solo writing and production duties. Under Rug Swept honestly sounds as though Alanis walked into the studio and proceeded to record without ever pausing to edit any lyrical aspect of her songs. Witness the rambly nonsense of \"21 Things I Want In A Lover,\" the awkward phrasing of the otherwise excellent \"Hands Clean,\" and the altogether ill-advised thunder of \"A Man.\" The unusual indisputable hits that we've come to expect are entirely absent, unless you count the epilectic electric guitars of kiss-off \"Narcissus,\" which verge very closely on being annoying.There are two songs on this disc that prove that Alanis is still a force to be reckoned with. \"So Unsexy\" combines a simple two-measure guitar riff with an equally simple bass line, and upon these strong foundations Alanis vents her unedited spleen in the effective fashion that we've come to expect from her; its at once sweet and defiant, and totally catchy. \"Flinch\" is slowly strummed classic, loaded with real couplets and an actual narrative. For just a track it hijacks the pop production of the disc for its own purposes, and comes out as the plainest and best heartbreak ballad in Alanis's entire catalogue.Hearing this pair of tunes makes it clear that there are still good songs to be heard from our erstwhile Canadian friend; obviously someone just has to figure out how to whittle them down after they effortlessly flow out of her.\n", "val": 0.0022462918423116207}
{"text": "I purchased this CD around this time last year, when it was released. I was very pleased with it then, and I'm even more pleased with it now.There are few CDs you can listen to over and over again, but that still stand the test of time. Usually, I get bored with even the best CDs after a month or two. But not Under Rug Swept. After Jagged Little Pill, I didn't think Alanis could produce something of the same caliber, or even close. She certainly didn't come close with Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (which wasn't a terrible album, really, just not very memorable). But as they say, third time's a charm. I recently put this CD into my CD player after a long hiatus, and I haven't stopped listening to it since. I've listened to it I-don't-know-HOW-many-times, but I swear it just keeps getting better. There is no real hit single on this one, like from her first album (\"Ironic\", \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"You Oughta Know\", \"All I Really Want\"...must I go on?), but the first single, \"Hands Clean\" was very catchy I thought. It's a shame more of the tracks weren't turned into singles.Like my title states, this is a much lighter version of Alanis Morissette. We all remember her as the angry young woman who was burned by love in \"You Oughta Know\". But I do not detect any anger from her in any of these tracks. Her songs are more mellow, slightly more pop-rock, and in my opinion just as good as the ones off of Jagged Little Pill. Besides \"Hands Clean\", the other stand-out songs from the CD are \"21 Things I Want in a Lover\", \"Narcissus\", \"So Unsexy\", \"Precious Illusions\", \"You Owe Me Nothing in Return\" and \"Surrendering\". Ok - pretty much the whole disc is a stand-out. As usual, you can tell Alanis has put a lot of herself and her personal experiences into the songs. She, of course, writes her own songs, which is very admirable in a time when the music business is dominated by scantily-clad young women who have OTHER people write their songs for them. Alanis has a great voice, great lyrics, great songs. If you liked Jagged Little Pill, and even if you were incredibly disappointed with Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, Alanis redeems herself fully with Under Rug Swept.

{"text": "The cd was really great. None of her cds have disappointed me yet. I know on this cd she is expressing her anger towards her abuse when she was younger, and she does a great job of conveying it. Here are the critiques:1. 21 Things I Want In A Lover- She is basically naming off all the things she wants in a guy, but there could be a few exceptions. A song someone would probably sing about many years of dating the same people consistently. Basically the title says it all. Very fast and relatively short, in my opinion.2. Narcissus- An angry song about the way a guy treated her at one time. It kind of reminds me of all the vain jocks in high school that treat the highly intelligent girls [badly] during high school.3. Hands Clean- This is a song about her an affair she had with an older man when she was younger. Then she basically explains in the song how she got to present day.4. Flinch- This song is basically talking about if she was to meet up with her ex lover (childhood lover, maybe?) if she were to meet up with him again today. It kind of gives the mental picture of when two ex lovers meeting in the present and they joke around about the way they were when they were younger and how much they've changed, over a cup of coffee.5. So Unsexy-In this song, she talks about how poorly her lover at thirteen treated her and how the little things that he did really scarred her as person through her sex life.6. Precious Illusions-It basically describes how she lied to herself when she was younger when she was in the relationships. She lied to basically hide from something. In the end, she lost herself in the process. Her pain sounds like that of a mistress when she is continually told by her married lover, that he is going to divorce his wife and come to her, but deep down inside she knows thats never going to happen. Its pretty fast.7. That Particular Time-She basically talks about how at that time she was immature and naive and didn't know that love really wasn't like that. She describes all the things she went through. A very slow but long song, but its very descriptive.8. A Man-She describes how a man taught through the generations he is taught to be the way he is through men whom have been scarred by bad women. Basically she describes a guy's life through a male's mindset. A medium length song that doesnt pick up until after the first few lines.9. You Owe Me Nothing in Return- A pretty fast paced song. Alanis reveals some of the anamosity towards her past lover. She basically saying she forgiving him and willing to be his friend to some point. But she won't make that mistake again. And just because of their past relationship, he owes her no kind of relationship of any kind at all. But she is willing to be a friend like always no matter what.10. Surrendering- It has a foreign start picks up as she starts singing. She basically angrily admiring him for going on with life so easily despite that deep down inside, he knows what he did was wrong.11. Utopia- A slow song to end off the cd. Very well worth the wait. I think its a song that everyone should listen to for themselves and interpret it the way they want.I think that overall the cd was really good. I recommend it to anyone. It is most definitely a change from her usual. I think that this cd is a very good investment. Its really not depressing as much as it is invigorating and rejuvenating.\n", "val": 0.00013947216211818159}

{"text": "This CD is really good! I like it a lot. I have to say, my favorite Alanis CD varies all the time! Sometimes I feel like \"Under Rug Swept\" Sometimes I feel like \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" and sometimes I feel like \"Jagged Little Pill\" and, sometimes, even the softer side of \"MTV Unplugged.\" Right now I'm in a \"MTV Unplugged\" mood. Each CD offers a different style, in my opinion, and each is artistically beautiful. This CD is a less \"jagged\" Alanis side, and not as guitar heavy. Well, that is both good and bad. I liked the guitars in both JLP and SFIJ. This (URS) is a nice CD to listen to at any time. In fact, I listened to it while decorating the Christmas tree last week, preferring it over even the best Christmas CD ever (Mariah Carey's \"Merry Christmas\") My favorite song is \"Hands Clean\", the biggest single from this album. Here's a breakdown of the songs.1. 21 things i want in a lover - This is a great track. I like the guitar-ness of it. One of my favorites. (4/5)2. narcissus - Also a great song. I like this pop-ish side to Alanis. This is also one of my favorites (4/5)3. hands clean - As stated before, this is my favorite song on the CD. It's great. I heard about it on alanis.com and I got really excited, downloading it right away. I was so excited, I cried, LoL. (5/5)4. flinch - Another GREAT song! One of my definite favorites! Its great. I like the slow side to Alanis. In fact, I like every side Alanis puts out, she sounds great in all of them. (5/5)5. so unsexy - Great song. Like it a lot. Makes me wish I were 13 again... LoL, just kidding. (3.5/5)6. precious illusions - Liked this song the first time I heard it. I'm glad it was released as the next single, but then again, maybe not because it kinda killed the song for me. That's why I gave it a lower rating. (4/5)7. that particular time - This is a great slow song. Not one of my favorites, but it's still really really good. (3.5/5)8. a man - Not the best song in the world, really. It's ok, probably my least favorite song on the CD. (2.5/5)9. you owe me nothing in return - Ooh, I really like this song. It's really good. Yeah, that's it. (4/5)10. surrendering - This is a really good song, too. Yep, I like it a lot. That's all! LoL (4/5)11. utopia - This is the first song I heard off of URS. It's really good. I nice slower song. Very inspiring... (3.5/5)This is  great CD! I recommend it to anyone. It fell off of the Billboard 200 charts surprising quickly after being highly critically acclaimed. I was really dissapointed that it didn't really catch on with the public that much. Owe well, it's probably one of the best kept secrets in the music business. If you don't own this CD already, you should go buy it! You won't regret it. Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.046852998435497284}
{"text": "After hearing \"Hands Clean\" on the radio for the thousandth time and having it finally grow on me, I decided to buy Alanis Morissette's third offering, Under Rug Swept.  Alanis has never disappointed her listeners in providing catchy tunes, and figuring out what her lyrics means is also half the fun.The album starts off with a barage of man-hating songs that all follow the same basic theme of how Alanis has been burned by one too many relationships with the opposite sex in her lifetime.  The last few songs on the album offer a consiliatory balance to all this hatred by offering lyrics that serve as mild complements to men.  Frankly, I'm a little tired of Alanis and her male bashing.  It might have been compelling in her first album, and maybe even expectedly funny in her second, but it's just annoying to hear yet another album full of this same propaganda.  Okay, we get it, ALANIS MORISSETTE HATES MEN.\"Hands Clean\" is the best song on the album, and it's little wonder why the remaining songs were never played on the radio.  They're all pretty much the same.  On the plus side, all the songs have great beats and they all serve to complement each other.  On the down side, \"Hands Clean\" is the only song that really stands out, while the other songs are largely monotonous and forgettable.  I recommend this album if you like Alanis, like feminism, or hate men.  If you're not one of these, don't waste your money.\n", "val": 0.003392912447452545}

I must say to anyone who feels \"iffy\" about buying this because they disliked Supposed Former Infactuation Junkie: Let your fears rest. Alanis' second entry emphasised spirituality and kind of lost it's focus with awkward melodies and completely unmemorizably complex lyrics. Under Rug Swept gets back to classic Alanis\"like You Learn,Ironic and Head Over Feet\". At times, I wish she was a little more edgy and angry like in her first album, but I understand she has grown, both as a person and as an artist. She is more mature and intelligent, but it doesn't prevent her from kicking some a**.Buy this album. It repays repeated listening and it delivers the goods.

{"text": "This CD is very different than Jagged Little Pill and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, but it definitely holds its own and has spurred a new wave of popularity for Alanis in 2002.The album begins with the upbeat \"21 Things I Want in a Lover,\" which is a foot-tapping fun song that has been described by Alanis as being half-joking and half-serious.  The song describes characteristics Alanis wants in a lover (as the title suggests), and the flow and meter are really good.  The chorus also fits into the song very well, and the guitar is well done.  This is a very rock-ish song, but it's not too heavy, and overall I think the music compliments the lyrics and vocals very well.The second song, \"Narcissus,\" is probably one of the weaker of the album, but has a relatively catchy beat.  This song fuels the fire of Alanis' \"angry\" reputation.  I think the chorus is kind of funny, and is a good contrast to the biting verses, but overall this song isn't very memorable.You've probably heard \"Hands Clean\" on the radio, and this song is a softer rock style.  The only thing that really turns me off about this song is that it was overly popularized, so I can't have a very strong opinion on it anymore.  I do adore some of the lyrics, though, such as \"I know you sexualize me like a young thing would and I think I like it.\"  This part is sung very well.\"Flinch\" is a slow song, but very poignant.  The chorus is actually its strongest point, albeit short, and Alanis' emotion comes through well in this song.  Alanis also didn't go vocal-crazy in editing this song, so you get to hear more of her \"real\" voice, which is always a plus.\"So Unsexy\" is one of the better songs on the album, with its pop-like opening, but still is distinct from mainstream songs.  This song should have been a single.  Many teenagers and probably adults as well can identify it, and again, the vocals are done nicely, letting Alanis' voice come through.  The verses are subtle and flow well.\"Precious Illusions,\" the second single, is a pretty and catchy song, relaying a common emotion of life.  This song is not at all \"angry,\" but it didn't do very well as a single.  I don't think it's very radio-friendly, actually, but it's one of my favorites.  Alanis does some rather experimental melodies at the beginning, which are extremely hard to sing, but she does a great job.  I love the melody, and the chorus is nice.  This whole song is just put together extremely well.\"That Particular Time\" is another ballad, and Alanis' emotions come through very strongly here.  It has a very even flow, and it's about the gradual dissolving of a relationship.  The heartfelt lyrics are probably what makes this song the best, and the way Alanis sings them.\"A Man\" is an alternative song, and is unlike any of the other songs on the CD.  It has a nice tune, but is rather awkward, as Alanis describes her thoughts from a man's point of view.  Overall, not a strong point of the album, but has a very interesting opening, setting it apart from the other songs, and I applaud Alanis for attempting a song like this.\"You Owe Me Nothing in Return\" was initially one of my favorite songs, but now I see that there is not much distinct about it, and it blends into the album.  I suppose this comes partially from being toward the end of the CD.  The verses and the chorus are both good, and the song has a rather bitter tone.  Overall, nicely put together, but again, not very distinct.\"Surrendering\" is possibly my favorite song on the entire album.  The guitar has a \"country\" - ish overtone, and I dig the flute at the beginning.  The end is also very nice and leaves the listener feeling satisfied.  The melody is very upbeat and positive, although there is debate over whether this song is supposed to be sarcastic or simply direct.  It flows extremely well, and the chorus rocks my socks off.  You will surely want to sing along with this song, often overlooked.  If the decision had been up to me, I would have released this as the first single of the album.  Very radio-friendly but certainly not drab pop, Alanis has definitely scored big with this song.  It's a perfect way to \"end\" the album, and will leave a smile on your face.  It's probably the most refreshing song on the whole album.  The guitar is great.  The one weak point of this song is the overlapping vocals - it's just too much.  The audio DVD version on this has just one vocal track, and I recommend that version.  Nevertheless, when I'm in a bad mood I listen to this song, and I highly recommend that you download this even if you don't plan on buying the album.\"Utopia\" is a pretty song, although it seems rather misplaced on the album.  As the title suggests, this is Alanis' yearning for peace.  It's very relaxing, the lyrics are pretty, and the melody is well-done.  The guitar is nice too.  It's pretty friendly to any sort of person, and doesn't take much adjusting to to like, but it's not as memorable as it could be because of its major contrast to the rest of the songs on this CD.Overall, a very well put together CD.  Like any other musical composition, it has a lot of weak spots, but the excellent songs - \"So Unsexy,\" \"Precious Illusions,\" \"Flinch,\" \"Surrendering,\" among several points in all of the others, compromise for any of the awkwardness on this CD.  It is much more listener-friendly than JLP and SFIJ, and, while I think those two albums are more appealing, this one appeals to a wider spectrum of listeners.  Even if you err to the side of pop this CD will probably appeal to you, and if you like Alanis you will learn to love this CD as well.  I recommend it strongly, and I also HIGHLY recommend its follow-up CD/DVD \"Feast on Scraps,\" to be released December 10.\n", "val": 0.015541049651801586}

{"text": "After the 1998 \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\", many people thought that Alanis career as a musician was over.But that's not true because the \"Under Rug Swept\" is an excellent album, worth the four-years-waiting that the Alanis's fans had to bear.Of course, it wouldn't be fair to compare this album with Alanis's masterpiece: the 1995 \"Jagged Little Pill\", because the \"Under Rug Swept\" is not as good as that one, but anyway it's got excellent songs such as \"Narcissus\", \"Flinch\", \"Precious Illusions\", \"You Owe Me Nothing in Return\", \"Surrendering\" and \"Utopia\".I'm not saying that the other songs ..., but I listed the ones that I like to listen to over and over... in fact, Utopia is my favorite song of the album I guess.Alanis has evolved, and this album reflects that in many ways: lyrically (her lyrics make more sense than the ones of the \"Supposed...\"), musically (this album contains great songs, from hard-rock songs such as \"21 things I Want in a Lover\" to ballads such as \"Flinch\"), vocally (\"That Particular Time\" and \"A Man\" are examples of this), and as a person (now she's not just a songwriter but a producer as well).In this album, Alanis (as usual) not only sings, but plays guitars and keyboards as well. She also plays her flute (though she plays it just 5 seconds in the beginning of \"Surrendering\", but it's really nice anyway). But Alanis (strangely) doesn't play her harmonica in any of the songs of this album.This album is really a good purchase and it's worth its price: with this album you can feel the force that Alanis has come back with, and you can feel how much she's evolved.Gotta buy it.

{"text": "To start off with the worst: The lyrics really strike me - negatively! I've always found a lot of inspiration through Alanis' songwriting, but this effort is a joke! Alanis reminds me of a 13yr old teenie girl, who strikes the balance out of her so-called relationships! Obviously, Alanis really does have a problem with men. She seems to use them up excessively and all of them seem to affect her that much that she ends up writing almost a dozen songs which sound all the same - lyrically! She always claims to be that strong a person and promotes an overwhelming \"charisma\", but she really really has to grow a lot as a person living in a relationship. These topics are just worn thin, but I bet and I fear that she's going to write another million songs in the vein of \"hands clean\".As to the music: going solo as a musician and producer, she seemed to have decided to leave out some of the uniqueness Glen Ballard seemed to add to her music and hop into the mainstream. You know, songs such as \"so unsexy\" and \"precious illusions\" could easily be placed among Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera.

{"text": "I have read many reviews of UNDER RUG SWEPT, and alot of things are good...many are bad. Of course people will have mixed thoughts on particular tracks from the album, but that's with any album. And I haven't read any review yet that understands the contrasting occurrences in Alanis's music. This review is generally for those who have only heard SWEPT's songs on the radio and are curious of the album's other contents. The funny thing about Alanis is that she always seems to grow with each record she releases. But this time, it seems she shrunk. Not in a bad way. It's just that SWEPT contains only about 40% of the richness that her previous release, SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE, contained. And no, I will not mention JAGGED LITTLE PILL at all. That's the problem. People compare this release to PILL, completely eliminating JUNKIE. Come on people, let's not do that. Contrary to anyone's belief, PILL had the honesty, yes. But it lacked excellent musical quality, and JUNKIE made up for that. Don't get me wrong, PILL was great. And who am I to say? It sold a whopping 13 million copies. I just find JUNKIE to be more fulfilling, lyrically and musically. Then, we move to this release (skipping MTV UNPLUGGED). UNDER RUG SWEPT is the \"laid-back\" release in my opinion. First, you have to consider the fact that Morissette produced this album on her own, without the genious mind of ex-producer Glen Ballard. So, pure sounds and music isn't expected. Atleast, I didn't expect it. Nonetheless, she did a terrific job. That's where people get confused. She had fun with this album. Many people say too much fun, but I don't agree. Although poppy and \"mainstream\"-style, the first three tracks on the album still manage to get out some heavy duty points. Eventually, the album takes on more of a chronological order. And at that time (mainly after \"Hands Clean\"), I'm sure Britney/NSync boppers would turn away. The pop ends there. The beauty of this album lies within the fact that the style of each song varies so greatly, and relays so much emotion. Particularly on songs such as \"Flinch\", \"So Unsexy\", and \"That Particular Time\". My personal noted glitch in the system is \"Precious Illusions\", but that's only because it revives the pop sound for a minute...and was chosen for the album's second single. Great song, yes. Not the best on SWEPT, though. I think that turned many away. I'm babbling. I just wanted to clear up doubts. I decided to write when someone said to me that \"all hope was lost once Alanis released this CD\". I highly disagree. Despite the striking critics or DJ's or whoever, Alanis remains to be the honest female voice of a decade and more. Whether she's doing alternative or pop. Or alt-pop. Whatever the hell people call it these days. Certain people have complained far too much about this wonderful album. I see many positive reviews here on Amazon, though! :) But the negative ones...they should look at the bright side...it's not like Alanis is co-headlining tours with Britney. When that day comes, some hope is lost. But I'll never lose full hope for this woman. She's an extraordinary talent, and after ALL my words...I recommend this album! :)\n", "val": 0.0015766684664413333}

What she offers are good songs about real life situations that Alanis has faced, and many of us have too, more or less. Guys, it's amazing stuff. If you are not into autobiographical songwriters, however, than this isn't for you, because that's exactly what Alanis is, but I am one to applaud her for it, for she does the job very honestly and skillfully, and makes the best music there is, as far as I'm concerned. (Please note: SISTER BLISTER, BENT 4 U, and the best song she's ever made, SORRY 2 MYSELF were all made for this album and left off, among many others, and they are even better than most of the songs on this album, so check out the PRECIOUS ILLUSIONS and HANDS CLEAN import singles. BENT 4 U is definitely going to be included on her upcoming EP, that I know for a fact. But one thing's for sure, if you doubt Alanis even a little bit, you must listen to SORRY 2 MYSELF, as well as UTOPIA, who I'm sure many lazy reviewers haven't even listened to. Why? Because it's the last track on the disc, and judging from the instantly negative attitudes in some of these reviews I can tell that a lot of reviewers probably never even bothered to flip to the end of the CD for the final track, because if they had their reviews could not be negative, they could not.)\n", "val": 0.015626773238182068}
{"text": "I think the word to sum up Alanis's Under Rug Swept album is \"exuberant\".  I'm not \"into\" music, but I have been absolutely captivated by all of Alanis's albums.  I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of her releases.  The editorial review of this album COULDN'T BE MORE WRONG.  The incredible lyrics adds so much dimension to the entire musical experience and obviously the reviewer doesn't have the capacity to appreciate Alanis's artistic expression.  It would be like viewing an impressionistic painting and complaining about \"all the dots\".  This album truly is a masterpiece.  I also had the distinct pleasure of attending Alanis's Denver live performance not too long ago, and it was INCREDIBLE.  DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ALBUM!\n", "val": 0.05633804574608803}

{"text": "Under Rug Swept isn't a bad album, but I wouldn't list it amongst my favorite female rock albums either. I really like the Indian flavor of many of the tracks on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Under Rug Swept is basically back to a more generic pop-rock sound; similar to Jagged Little Pill, but definitely more mature both musically and lyrically. Alanis' penchant for switching the logical order of words (the album's title is a perfect example) and love of stressing awkward syllables and words in a line for the sake of the melody has always driven me nuts and will apparently continue to.For whatever my complaints, there are some really good tracks on the album though. Hands Clean and Narcissus are strong songs. It's nice to hear Alanis singing from a different point of view in A Man. So Unsexy and You Owe Me Nothing feel a lot like my life.\n", "val": 0.018751809373497963}
{"text": "You must know as you read this, I am a true Alanis Morisette fan.  I admire her gritty lyrics, her flexible voice and her range of song writing.  'Jagged little pill' was literally worn out in my cd player, then 'Former Infatuation Junkie' followed with a bit of a fizzle (but I still listened). That being said I was ecstatic the first time I listened to her new album (of course with lyrics in hand, I love it when they print them like this)and was happy to hear her original style and confidence back in full force.If you buy this album you will get catchy lyrics, including a dash of profanity (I have to turn it down so my kids don't hear it), a variety of song style from rockin' to sadly remembering, to very sing songy, and even a bit of an ethereal sound which I actually find to be a nice last track. I won't go through each song because so many others have already done that here for you.  I have a hard time giving anything 5 stars, because that would mean it is PERFECT but this is pretty gosh darned close.  If you are a fan from the past, especially her debut album, this new CD will not disappont you.  Buy with confidence, especially if you enjoy singing along and letting it all loose (when you're alone, of course) :-)\n", "val": 0.02641996555030346}
{"text": "Alanis has made two previous albums which were excellent however this time around the album leaves a lot to be desired. The song 'Hands Clean\" is by far the best track on the album, followed by \" A Man'. A song is which Alanis describes herself as being \"a man who has grown from a son\" an all that. I know that these words are not always to be taken literally but come on Alanis were you ever a man. The rest of the album is just a repetition of similar beats and moods that Supposed Former...... portrayed. The album could used a lot more work and what's with that eleven track foolishness. Give me eleven tracks if all are good otherwise about four more 'filler' songs would do just fine.\n", "val": 7.038669718895108e-05}

{"text": "After \"JAGGED LITTLE PILL,\" I thought that there was no way Alanis could ever create material that would even come close to that amazing debut album. I was very, very wrong! \"Under Rug Swept\" is not the continuation of \"PILL,\" but it certainly rivals it with similar rhythms and melodies (not to mention the beautiful poeticness of \"JUNKIE\")! To put it simply, '21 Things I Want In A Lover' 'Precious Illusions' and 'Hands Clean' recall the white heat that made 'PILL' so enormously successful, while recalling 'JUNKIE' with emotional, deep lyrics. With or without Glen Ballard, Alanis is a true master of her craft. \"Hands Cleans,\" the first single, is a beautiful, up-tempo, radio-ready cut that is deeply personal for Alanis. This song is based on a true life account that goes back to her years as a teenager. Like all songs from Alanis, though, each is either based on experience or thoughts on society. \"So Unsexy\" speaks of insecurities, and how people can sometimes feel unworthy when compared to others. Too Deep? Well, that's just Alanis. Love her or not, \"Precious Illusions\" is definitely the best track on the entire album. Hard rock, mixed with hip-hop, and deeply meaningful words that speak of dreams that give illusionary happiness, I can't get enough of this song. But then again, the whole album is so well constructed and balanced, there isn't a tune on the entire record I could honestly call my least favourite. Some tracks that are missing, and are also brilliant, include: \"Sister Blister\" (Japan only album track - also available on \"Hands Clean\" singles for the UK, Canada and Australia), \"Fear of Bliss\" (Japan only album track - also available on \"Hands Clean\" singles in the UK and Australia), \"Unprodigal Daughter\" (UK and Aussie singles), \"Awakening Americans\" (Aussie single), \"Symptoms\" (UK and Aussie singles), \"Bent 4 You\" (UK and Aussie singles), \"Offer\" (UK and Aussie singles), \"Sorry 2 Myself\" (UK and Aussie singles), and \"Hands Clean - Acoustic Version\" (UK, Canadian, and Aussie singles).

{"text": "First the obligatory statement, \"This CD rocks!\"What a great disk.  From the test yourself Id initiated \"21 Things\" track to the introspective \"So Unsexy\" to the exonerating \"A Man\", every one of them falls into the category of very good to just plain great.Alanis has an incredible knack for producing really unique and highly listenable music.  If you owned Jagged Little Pill, and found that the best songs were the ones not played on the radio, you to will find this CD to be a gem.  The music is just as edgy and full and in your face.  The driving guitars and thought provoking lyrics remind you that Alanis seems to be ready to take on the world.But she has grown up some as well.  No longer the angry you woman, us guy types can even find a song sympathetic to our ears.  In \"A Man\" we are told we have taken and given a lot of garbage, but we have tried to better ourselves, and we have suceeded.Now I must go steal the CD back from my wife who is being quite stingy about sharing it with me.\n", "val": 0.03855457156896591}
{"text": "I am astounded firstly with the brilliant music produced-- well arranged; a musical masterpiece. I found the second album very deep, a bit too deep perhaps, but I enjoyed 'So Pure' immensely. This album seems to have taken the construction of pleasure tones from So Pure and extended itself into a whole album.Alanis has always been insightful in her lyrics and the first album I thought was so refreshing at that time because there were no singers who could thrash out as brilliantly melodic.The second album was 'alanis introspective' and it got a bit carried away with the prodigous spinning of lyrics; very deep stuff.This album is lyrics refined, thought provoking yet simple, music strategically arranged, and a voice that of a masterful poet who knows how to put feelings into music and musical feelings into words; and translate it back into legible musical feelings.I took my time in deciding to buy this album; I heard it first at the shop but wasn't convinced yet. Though my friend bought it and played it in the car everyday. I found myself looking forward to listening to it every morning I bummed a ride off her. One day she didn't bring it in the car and I felt indignantly disappointed-- sounds overly exaggerated over an album, but there you go. Took me a month of listening to it before rushing to buy the album.And I listen to it every morning; I find it inspiring.Alanis is not a celebrity too much in the spotlight like some others and I respect her as a musician for letting her music represent her more than anything else would. She celebrates in being a woman and I don't find her whining about boyfriends (or lack thereof)-- she's got it figured, specially with the track 'a man', 'that particular time', 'surrendering'.my favourite: precious illusions.\n", "val": 0.036907993257045746}

It's been a few years since we saw Alanis, and she came back with a great album. This time she is not all in your face understanding like in Suppose Former Infatuation Junkie, and shes not out right angry like in Jagged, instead she is a mixture of delighted feelings, relationship analysis, and self discovery. In my favroite song of the album, You Owe Me Nothing In Return, Alanis illustrates the depth of unconditional love. In Flinch, Hands Clean, Surrending, That Particular Time, and So Unsexy Alanis analyzes past relations and shows the outcome or the actions they took. In 21 Things I Want In A Lover and Narciuss she shows the type of things she prefers. And in A Man and Utopia, she shows the fantasy part of her writing, where she highlights her imaginary worlds and thoughts.

{"text": "Well the way things look there never will be another Jagged Little Pill. My biggest complaint is that Alanis doesnt give emotion or put her heart into her songs on Under Rug Swept. Moving on though, Under Rug Swept has some great songs, and one horrible song. In my opinion 21 Things I Want In A Lover is one of Alanis' worst songs ever. The song really has no point other than her listing things she wants in a guy. Honestly, who cares? The song is really rather confusing the first few times you listen to it because things that are seperate, come across as one thing. But Im not going to let one annoying song make me take a star away from my rating of the cd. Once past 21 Things I Want In A Lover the rest of the songs are much like those from Jagged Little Pill but never quite reaching what makes Jagged Little Pill so great. It begins with Narcissus, where the male bashing begins. Being a guy it may seem odd, but this song is funny because Alanis truly is naming almost every type of guy and telling what is wrong with them. Note:She forgets sensitive and shy to name a few. Next we go to Hands Clean, which frequent radio listeners are almost sure to skip. I got this cd the Thursday after it came out and this song drives me up a wall, I don't listen to the radio at all, but it still annoys me(on a RARE occasion I will listen to it). Then we go to Flinch. In all honesty when you think about it pretty hard, Flinch could be about the same guy Alanis bashed big time on You Oughta Know. The songs pretty good, but in my opinion it moves to slow. We reach So Unsexy which is in my opinion the best song on the album. Alanis is basically saying that shes 28(not directly stated) and is tired of being treated 13 again(directly stated). Once Alanis is ready to go to a third single for Under Rug Swept I think she should definately go with So Unsexy. Now we go to Precious Illusions which is the current single. When the song starts out I hate it, but as it progresses it is much more enjoyable. Continuing on, unlike Flinch, That Particular Time is a very enjoyable slow song. I think this song and Flinch should be right next to each other with Utopia on the album. Song #8, A Man, puts Alanis in the position of a man and she sees how miserabley we are treated by SOME women. You Owe Me Nothing in Return is a fast slow song where Alanis tells her boyfriend that he owes her nothing in return for her love. Surrendering is a fun song that is fast but very out of place, the previous and next song were/are somewhat slow, while this is fast and almost made to dance to. Utopia(Alanis Fact:after September 11th Alanis made this song available for download only a week or so after the tragedy)this song is slow and has some rather cheesy lines in my opinion. Example-\"we provide phones\" and there are a few more. Overall Under Rug Swept is enjoyable, just don't expect a second Jagged Little Pill, like most are calling it.\n", "val": 0.00028713923529721797}
{"text": "Alanis Morissette should require all of her future companions to listen to her albums, not excluding her latest addition, \"Under Rug Swept.\" Doing so should clear up any possible confusion as to why she sets forth such unreachable standards for those interested in loving her.It is because of her newest release that listeners will understand why she says things like, \"do you have a big intellectual capacity but know that it alone does not equate wisdom?\" And when she claims how one should \"derive joy from diving in and seeing that loving someone can actually feel like freedom,\" audiences won't think that she is asking too much from those interested in becoming something more.Apparently, Morissette is just a girl who knows what she wants.Even those not interested in becoming romantically involved with Morissette (the large majority of her listening demographic) will find \"Swept\" refreshingly poetic, as she reclaims her status through 11 four-minute tracks as the mellow (yet still aggressive) heroine.On \"Swept,\" Morissette continues to sing about the things \"you oughta know,\" and while she revisits her experiences with love, she demonstrates her strongest lyrical gift turning tender songs into aggressive ballads.As if the first two albums didn't expose her private, personal issues enough, Morissette's current attempt further explores her life experiences with her trademark confidence, control and authority. This time, however, she has somewhat mellowed out her act not only through her expressive vocal ability but also by going solo with every producing and writing credit.Asking potential lovers to fulfill her emotional and intellectual requests is a brave demand, but after all, Morissette, who established herself as the queen of '90s rock with the success of \"Jagged Little Pill\" and \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" can afford to keep her standards above average.With this third studio release, however, she falls short of creating a musical revolution. Perhaps she has exhausted the sounds, tones and notes that once marked her music as influential. Still, she has developed as an artist by experimenting with a more reserved approach. She shares her advise about what she learned from living through heartache and visiting India, even though she fails to ignite the passion that once dominated her musicality.Her theories about life and love seem lost underneath her vocal ability that is drowned out by her infamous nasal pitch. The guitar work and the keyboard solos spark special notes and hooks, but the overall composition of the music lacks the pace heard in her first two efforts. She shines on tracks \"Hands Clean\" and \"That Particular Time\" as her lyrics and music balance each other, creating harmonies and melodies that stay with the listener.Before, Morissette sang with anger and hatred towards those individuals who played with her feelings, and though she explains that she has 'swept' those past lovers into a special place, it would be nice to hear more songs devoted to the explosive emotions and uncontrollable rage that comprises her inner thoughts.Now, with a reserved approach, Morissette sings with an understanding of how these places and people influenced the person she has become. But, some of her religious rant and perfect idealism does not mesh with the personal issues that the rest of the album deals with. She requests her companions to have numerous \"Utopian\" qualities, and as she preaches in that final track, \"we would share and listen and support and welcome.\"Sadly Alanis, that would only work in perfect world, so stop dabbling in all of the soft, introspective sentiment; and for the sake of listening audiences everywhere, we request that you to take another dose of your rage before you start working on future projects.\n", "val": 0.006616136059165001}

Similar to the last two albums except more mature and sweet, \"Under rug swept\" has it's share of addictive singles just like the past albums had namely \"ironic\", \"you outta know\", \"thank you\", \"you learn\" and \"that would be good\". This album has soothing alternative tracks rather than \"you outta know\" type nasty tracks. When you'd buy it you'd think that \"hands clean\" with it's soft smooth voice vocals would be the hit of the album right? Wrong! Although at the beginning of the song I'm about to mention you'd think that it would be a boring song, \"so unsexy\" is my favourite track from the album. Smooth great vocals in this single with a rocking background sound, this track has it all: great tune, her best vocal performance yet, good music, and great lyrics!  However Alanis Rock lovers are in luck! Songs like \"21 things\" and \"Narcissus\" would remind you of \"you outta know\". Among the sweet/ rock tracks are a few ballads like \"flinch\" a good -beat dance mix single. Also included in her album are a bunch of powerful hard rock tracks like \"surrendering\". Still \"so unsexy\" is no doubt the best track in the whole album from the starting point \"Oh these little...\". It's for all \"ironic\" and \"recent Vanessa Carlton\" lovers as well as \"you learn\" and \"Celine Dion\" lovers.so unsexy- a soothing powerful instrumental rock/classical alternative piece for all Celine Dion, Vanessa Carlotn, you learn, thank you, and ironic lovers. It's what \"ironic\" was to Jagged little Pill and what \"thank you\" was to supposed former infatuation junkie!hands clean- the first video from the album, a sweet alternative piece.precious illusions- her next video a powerful rock hit.flinch- a dance ballad.21 things- for all \"you outta know\" lovers.Narcissus- another \"21 things\" fans piece.Utopia- a sweet new age \"Enya fans\" piece.surrendering- a powerful production once again for all \"you outta know\" lovers!Overall this album is great and really worth it but still it can't compete with \"Jagged Little Pill\"!\n", "val": 0.03980520740151405}

However, after listening to it several times, I find it to have much more quality than the original impression seemed to let on. This is one of those cd's that has to grow on you for sure as there is nothing that is going to blow you away initially like Jagged or even some of the tracks on Supposed. The strongest tracks are So Unsexy, Precious Illusions, Surrendering, and Hands Clean as these tracks offer compositional creativity and a powerful melody that Alanis is so good at attaining. The rest of the cd is decent and better than most stuff out there right now but expectations are high for Alanis and many fans will be justifiably disappointed with any mediocrity. Lyrically this cd is o.k.- many people have complained that the lyrics are trite and pointless at times which may be true but each person gets something different out of lyrics and there are pockets of solid substance in this cd. I could have given this cd a 5 but my biggest complaint was that the band is not featured enough. Alanis has alot of talent surrounding her and she needs to allow it to display itself to achieve an overall quality musical product. There were several times during the cd where I wanted her to let the band add something interesting to the song but it never happened.

This first track immediately reminded me of the same theme as prior. It's a hard, rockin' song, with the raw voice that was no powerful on the prior album. Excellent way to start this disc and begin the transition.Narcissus - I really liked how close she was to the mic to sing this song. you really get the opportunity to hear her voice, almost as if it was a'capella. the swanky background beat really mixes well with the song.Hands Clean - well there isn't much that can be re-said about this one, as it's so overplayed on the radio, everyone knows the words by now. it's a very nice song, interesting thoughts come to mind about a hidden affair, or perhaps even a taboo type of relationship...Flinch - when the song first started, i immediately thought it sounded like a country song, and i was waiting for the leanne rimes cameo :-). i enjoyed the simple guitar background, and pictured her singing this in the corner of a saloon with some people slow dancing in front of the barSo Unsexy - the guitar seemed a little overpowering on this one and i wasn't able to hear her voice as clearly as i would have liked. the beat is grand, and flowing, and certainly the lyrics tell a good story about a little girl, however, i think that her voice is what has made her such a sensation, and i would have liked to hear it closer on this one.Precious Illusions - I really liked how the background music slowly got going more and more, adding new effects and accoustics until it took off with a fun and festive beat. i could see myself swirling around in my living room dancing to this one. very enjoyable and pleasing harmonies. almost a peaceful song.That Particular Time - mmmmmm wonderful! I love the piano background. a soothing and pleasing song, and since there isn't an overpowering sound track to this one, you can hear her voice so clearly. she really does have a purer voice on this one than jagged little pill, where the raw quality matched the beat and meaning of the songs. she seems to be very easily able to adapt her singing to the meaning.A Man - This one is a rather swanky song. not necessarily something i could dance to , but almost a sexual song...a song that you might want to be intimate with it playing in the background. i could see a sequence in slow motion going with this song.You Owe Me Nothing In Return - ok, for some reason when this one came on, i felt like i was in the 70s or 80s and listening to a disco-esque beat. i know that i tend to overuse the word swanky, but when the word firts.....this is a slow dance song from the movie airplane perhaps :-)Surrendering - On now this is a fun song. It almost made me wonder if someone from madonna's team did the beats for this one...it's a little too \"hard\" to be on Music, but the beat does match well. The guitar did get a bit overpowered on some of the chorus parts, and i wasn't able to hear her words as clearly as i wanted to. then at other parts it just blended into the background and was very pleasing.Utopia - this one sounded rather celtic. i immediately thought of lorena mckennit when this one started. and the use of foreign language (or what sounded like it) was very nice to blend into the song. it sounded like a very needing, wanting, anticipating type of song. a perfect end to the cd....what is next for alanis?\n", "val": 0.0056223636493086815}

{"text": "On her first album, Alanis' limited vocal range was offset, and overcome, by her bursts of ferocious, angry energy, most famously displayed on \"You Oughta Know\".  On this album that energy is  tamed, and her vocal range pared down to a practical monotone.  The result, there's not a memorable melody on the whole album.  Don't expect any flashes of instrumental brilliance from her band either, there aren't any.  As far as the lyrics go, well, on the first song we're greeted with the Earth shattering bombshell that Alanis really prefers a man who is athletic, smart, and witty.  Wow.  Finally, what the world really needed: a song with all the daring and originality  displayed in those desperate singles ads that read: \"I really like sunsets and long walks on the beach.\"  The rest are no better.\n", "val": 0.00024577754084020853}
{"text": "Alanis' latest album,Under Rug Swept is a MUST BUY albumand it will really make you feel lucky to have chosen thisamazing album. Everything inside this album - the lyrics,music,vocal etc.. is almost perfect that gets on par with her mostsuccessful album,Jagged Little Pill. Alanis is a very rarekind of woman singer that writes and sings about her ownpersonal life and Under Rug Swept shimmers with thatconcept. I'm sure that the release of this album is notreally because of commercial and I can tell that from herlyrics that tell mostly about her perspectives and her personallove life. Songs from teen age pop stars and rappers alwayscontain dull and very common expression like \"baby I love you\"\"I love you\" \" you love me\" etc..,always the sameold thing for commercial release and I think it has corruptedthe meaning of true music. How many singers out there thatproduce,write,compose and sing songs about her own life?Alanis is that rare,her power of writing good songs is soperfect,it's invisible.Album arrangement (starts well,ends well) :The album starts off with an amazing rock song,21 Things IWant In A Lover. It's such a nice song and I re-played it againand again. It's sort of a song that bon your appetite to keeplistening to the whole album from the starting until the end.21 Things was my first impression to that album. And I wasgreatly impressed!The album ends with a peaceful and soul-comforting song, \"Utopia\"The ending song made me feel in solace and it really comfortme. All I want to tell is that,not only the songs are extremely good but songs arrangements in that album makes the album moreinfatuating.Comments :21 Things I Want In A Lover - Greatly impressed when I heard itfor the first time and loved it even more when I heard it for the2nd,3rd time and on. The part \"these are 21 things I want in a lover,not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer\" really suitable for the chorus.Narcissus - A cute and funny song that tells you about the so-called Alanis' personal indulgences.Hands Clean - Needless to say...impressive! Fell in love with itwhen I saw the MTV and loved it even more after buying the album.Alanis sings through her ex-lover's perspective(in their relationship)in the verses before entering the bridge and the chorus part.Flinch - An emotional song about her missing her ex-lover andtheir memories. Its music and lyrics are very touching especiallythis part \"I'd be paralyzed if I ran into you. My tongue wouldseize up if we were to meet again \"So Unsexy - Another pop rock song and the lyrics is kind of funny. Well done.Precious Illusions - The concept of this song is like Hands Cleanbut it's better and the music is much better than Hands Clean. A very infatuating and impressive song.That Particular Time - A hearbreatking song,just like Flinch and it's one of my favorites in the whole album. This part is the peak of the song \"In the meantime I lost myself , I am sorry I lost myself ... I am\"A Man - Less attractive if it's compared with other songs in that album but it's still infatuating!You Owe Me Nothing In Return - At first,I didn't really concentrate on this songs but after for a while,this song had become one of my favorites.Surrending - A very nice pop song which Alanis sings about howshe admires her lover. I like this part of the song \"I'm amazed byyour surrender in the face of threatening forces that I represent\"Utopia - This song,in my humble opinion,is the best song in the whole album. The music and the lyrics have made this song to perfection.It's a very humane song and you could find solace from this song.I love the part of \"we'd all coast down into safety nets\" and \"we'd all speak out,we'd all be heard,we'd all feel seen\".Hopefully this song will be released as the 3rd single after Precious Illusions.Lastly,if you feel that any of Alanis' previous albums disappointed you,don't ever judge this album on her previous work. Consider it as one of the best albums by her and one of the best in 2002.\n", "val": 0.01548838336020708}
{"text": "After Alanis blabbed all over SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE I felt like saying \"hey Alanis, shut up already!\" On this offering she quiets down just a bit. Just a bit though. She's still got a lot say. It didn't enjoy Alanis' previous offering so I was a bit hesitant to buy UNDER RUG SWEPT but after \"hands clean\" I decided to purchase it. Well I'm glad I did `cause it sounds like Alanis got her musical sensibilities back with this album.UNDER RUG SWEPT is a good blend of her 2 previous albums. It's a good mix of melodies and confessions. And does she ever confess. Each and every song is like a diary entry. From \"21 things I want in a lover\" to \"utopia.\" The difference is that the songs are much more structured and it flows much better than SFIJ. Finally she incorporates some hooks in to her songs!I really like this album. Some great bass work is evident on songs like \"narcissus\", \"so unsexy\", and \"you owe me nothing in return\" courtesy of Flea and Meshell Ndegeocello. This is also the first time that Alanis has produced an album all by herself. It was about time she ditched Glenn. Anyway UNDER RUG SWEPT is a great rock/pop piece of music. It shows Alanis sitting comfortable in the control booth.Even though she's still releasing those demons, it's much more controlled and it gives the listener to slip into it with more ease. The hip-hopish beats and funky bass take a little bit of the edge off. Standouts include \"21 things I want in a lover\", \"narcissus\", \"hands clean\", \"so unsexy\", \"you owe me nothing in return\" and \"surrendering.\" To me, Alanis needs to stay away form sappy songs like \"flinch\" and \"that particular time.\"UNDER RUG SWEPT is a solid collection even though the subject matter is pretty much the same. Hopefully Alanis balances out her material on her next offering. Maybe she's saving all of her happy thoughts for the next album.\n", "val": 0.013711318373680115}
{"text": "This album sees the much lauded Miss Morissette in more reflective mood. A bittersweet almost nostalgic tone is present in almost every song on display. One assumes that Alanis has drawn deeply from her own personal experience to give us this album.Whilst lacking slightly the anger and pure vitriol that made 'Jagged little pill' so special, 'Under rug swept' compensates with arguably meatier lyrical content and catchy hooks that inevitably draw the listener into repeated return visits. There is also less emphasis on the heavy guitar sound of JLP, possibly a consequence of Alanis taking up the producing reigns of this album.Standout tracks include \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\" a crunching guitar driven song which has Morissette listing things she desires in a potential lover. \"Are you curious and communicative\"? \"Hands clean\" the first single and a good indicator of Morissette's new direction. As well as the scathing \"Narcissus\" where the artist is almost chastising herself for her feelings toward the \"Narcissus boy\".Towards the end we are treated to two of the finest tracks on the entire album, the thoughtful \"Utopia\" and the hauntingly brilliant \"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\", arguably the most beautiful yet triste song she's ever recorded.This is in its own way just as brilliant as 'JLP', and no doubt marks Alanis Morissette's evolution as an adroit musical and creative force.\n", "val": 0.011908596381545067}
{"text": "This is the first Alanis Morrissette album I've listened to and absolutely loved! Great music seems to share your pain, to put into form what you cannot...and this album is no exception. No matter what your relationship background is, you will probably hear your story in Alanis's songs. \"21 things I want in a Lover\" and \"Narcissus\" open the album on an unexpected pop-friendly beat without betraying Alanis's individual mark. If you haven't met someone (man or woman) who matches the guy in \"Narcissus,\" you haven't really lived!\"Hands clean\" is almost impossible to get through because it deals with such a sensitive subject (sexual abuse) and Alanis Morrissette (tough girl or not) manages to evoke all sorts of emotions in the listener. It is reminiscent of Sheryl Crow's \"What Can I Do for You\" (both singers take on the persona of an abusive man who blames the girl) only stronger.\"Flinch\" and \"So Unsexy\" are the songs that affect me the most. \"Flinch\" is a beautiful ballad about the ambivalent power someone you were in love with years ago can still have over you. It is cathartic, yes, but is also universal truth. \"So Unsexy\" could be the unofficial anthem for 99% of all women or for anyone who has ever doubted her or his own worth even when knowing better.\"Precious Illusions\" (about letting go of emotional crutches and illusions) can speak to the loneliness in all of us.This album is wonderful and a surprise (for me at least.) I never knew Alanis Morrissette could sing such a beautiful storm. Like other albums this year such as John Mayer's ROOM FOR SQUARES (excellent!) and Norah Jones' COME AWAY WITH ME, UNDER RUG SWEPT comes as great comfort!\n", "val": 0.03767229616641998}

She has produced this one herself without Glen Ballard and she still has to learn some stuff.1. 21 Things I Want In A Lover - Opens the album very loud, with some great guitar riffs and Alanis' smart songwriting about her opinions what should make the perfect boyfriend. 3/52. Narcissus - Sounds like it should come from the Junkie album. The lyrics are abolutely great with their sarcastic attitude and the funky chorus of \"why why do I try to love you, try to love you when I really don't want me to.\" 3/53. Hands Clean - The first single talks about a relationship witch Alanis has kept a secret for some time. The chorus is fantastic and you will soon sing-along with her, jumping on you bed or something like that! 5/54. Flinch - This is a ballad about Alanis being very insecure about a broken relationship. 3/55. So Unsexy - Another rocksong with an impressive vocal performance but it sounds a bit forced. Great bass though. 3/56. Precious Illusions - Another single. This song sticks in your head inmediately and another good vocal performance by Alanis. 3/57. That Particular Time - This is the lyrical highlight of this album but musically a bit dull. 3/58. A Man - Alanis sings about the male perspective, but not very convincing. 2/59. You Owe Me Nothing In Return - This sounds to me as filler material. Sorry but I don't like it. 2/510. Surrendering - A bounchy song, very originally written and this would be my pick for release as a single. 4/511.

{"text": "Alanis Morissette's \"Under Rug Swept\" seems to have 3 parts to me. The first part, from \"21 Things...\" to \"Flinch\" is great. These first four songs are the best on the album, especially her single \"Hands Clean\". The second part, from \"So Unsexy\" to \"A Man\" are...pretty bad, actually. The sappy ballad \"That Particular Time\" does not seem like Alanis material. The last part, which is the last 3 songs, ends the album on the uptake. The song \"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\" sounds like an Alanis song, with its sarcasm-sweet lyrics and thumping, angry base line (courtesy of Me'shell Ndegeocello). The last song, \"Utopia\", (possibly written after September 11th)ends the album on a sweeter note. I don't think she will ever be able to top \"Jagged Little Pill\", but this one comes real close.

The songs sound so fresh and the melodies and her majestic voice just make you trip off to another world.

I also liked the lyrics to this album (although maybe sometimes they excess in feminism), which sound so careful and real.

She proves to be a songwriter with eclecticism and intellect that you simply can't find in teeny bopper entertainers that have SOOOOO unnecessarily dominated the airwaves these last few years.  It's great to see Alanis, Sheryl, Natalie and a host of other true women songwriters who are given once again a chance to show off and show how these-teeny bopper lamo fools-how to really pull off great music!

Her syntax and phrasing are not faulty -- in fact her singing is part of a distinctly Canadian performance style. (Our Lady Peace is a good example).

{"text": "HistoryWhen she came out with her debut cd in 1995 (Jagged Little Pill), I was fascinated by her honest and aggressive music. Sure, I had seen a flavor of that before in other female performers but not to the extreme in which she took it.The songs I liked best off of the Jagged Little Pill cd were Hand In My Pocket and Ironic. Besides the very catchy melodies, I enjoyed the quirky lyrics. There's just something about a girl who looks dead serious while singing about things that appear to be superficial.When she released Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie 2 1/2 years later, I was worried. The songs were less inspiring and more strange. Musically, she took a detour ala Prince style. Personally, I worried that she was turning into a nutcase ala Michael Jackson. Even though she produced a couple of hits (Thank U, Unsent), I think she was officially in the sophomore slump.So now, it's 3 1/2 years later and Alanis reappears on the airwaves. Unlike her last release, this cd only has 11 tracks (as opposed to the monumental 17 tracks).The BottomlineI have to tell you. I am totally impressed with this cd. I honestly didn't think she had it in her any more. And the had it in her part is the ability to produce market friendly songs that have some heart and soul to them. She did a great job of capturing that in her first cd but her second cd took a major detour.The Actual Cd ReviewAdmittedly, I haven't kept up on the Alanis machine over the past couple of years. My first surprise I encountered on this cd - no Glen Ballard. As he was a strong presence on her first two cd's, I am totally wondering why he is no where to be found here.Now, when it comes to writing cd reviews, I always write books. I would love to tell you something about each song on this cd however, I'd like you to stay awake.When Hands Clean was released a few weeks ago, I think it set the tone for the audience she wanted. It's popp-ish and guitar driven. And most importantly, it feels familiar without feeling old.Why the return to something more conventional? Lots of reasons I suppose. I think that the strangeness of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie alienated a lot of her fans and this single Hands Clean is clearly intended to grab some of her original fan base back.Maybe Maverick can only handle one nutcase (Madonna) on their label (or should we say HER label) at one time.Maybe Alanis has grown up and left behind a part of her personal life that doesn't require her to be so strange. Note: I reserve the right to change my mind on the strangeness. I must see some personal appearances first.Ordinarily, I would tell you that a song like Hands Clean is unique however, for Alanis, it's not. If you watch the video or just listen to the musical arrangement, you get a very upbeat feeling. In that way, it's not really too different from listening to any other pop song on the radio. It's when you hear the layers of lyrics that she spreads throughout the song that you realize gasp, wow!!! She alternates each stanza with a he said/she said conversation that is about the past but takes place in the present.Oh, the book, I know...it's already happening. Let me pause and just give you a couple of highlights of the cd. Or what I term, some of my most favorite songs.Flinch is like a stage of a love affair gone wrong. There's lots of anger and denial about the long term affect that this person still has on her. How long can a girl be tortured by you? The music is melancholy and doesn't hide behind any mask of superficiality. Flamepillar - I know you'll love this song.21 Things I Want In A Lover is absolutely, one of my most favorites on this cd. Prediction: next release for a single. It makes a super Springtime/Summer song. Musically, the track is aggressive like You Oughta Know with a twist of some of the hair metal we're hearing today. Alanis goes through a laundry list of qualities she wants in a lover. are you uninhibited in bed? more than three times a week? up for being experimental? are you athletic? are you thriving in a job that helps your brother? are you not addicted? On one hand, it's a bit hilarious listening to all of her wants. But then you gotta wonder, is she serious? Are people this picky in real life?That Particular Time can be so painful to listen to. In the tradition of the dramatic piano strokes of a Sarah McLachlan song, Alanis delves deeply into recounting a relationship. Unlike most of Alanis's songs, she's pretty straight forward with her lyrics. I've always wanted for you what you've wanted for yourself and yet I wanted to save us high water or hell and I kept on ignoring the ambivalence you felt and in the meantime I lost myself.A concept that Alanis latches on to with this cd is collaborating with other musicians. It's not a bad idea and at first, I was concerned about the Mariah Carey/JLo Syndrome. You know what I'm talking about - the need to get other people on your cd so it sells at least a couple of thousand copies.Props to Alanis for not picking any glamorous people for her collaborations.Stone Temple Pilots guitarist Dan Delo makes an appearance twice and there is no doubt that you feel his presence in 21 Things I Want In A Lover and Precious Illusions.Flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers contributes to the song Narcissus.The surprise of the cd is the collaboration with fellow label mate, Meshell Ndegeocello. The songs she's involved with are So Unsexy and You Owe Me Nothing In Return. When Meshell grooves on her bass, it adds a very different flavor to Alanis's style, especially in So Unsexy.The EndIf you enjoyed her first cd, you can't go wrong with this once. I encourage you to buy it. Every track will touch you in one way or another.\n", "val": 0.004075161647051573}
{"text": "In reading a review of her new album in a magazine, the only thing that the reviewer had to say they he disliked was Alanis' stream-of-consciousness lyrics.  That sometimes her rhythm is difficult to follow, and that it's hard to sing with her at times.That's exactly why I like her music so much.  Unlike any other artist that I know, she writes her music from instinct and doesn't overwork her stuff.

{"text": "This is Alanis finally finding herself, coming into her own. Where \"Jagged Little Pill\" found her exploring a new rock sound and coming to terms with raw emotions, and \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" was an expression of enlightenment and spiritual rebirth, \"Under Rug Swept\" is the product of an artist who finally has clarity of mind and is comfortable on all levels in verbalizing her feelings.The track starts out with the crunching guitar riff of \"21 Things I Want In A Lover,\" a driving standout cut. Here, she's edgy and strong musically, but she's also honest and fun lyrically. (\"Are you uninhibited in bed? More than three times a week? All for being experimental?\")\"Narcissus\" is one of those songs where you instantly associate it with someone. \"Dear Narcissus boy / I know you've had your butt licked by your mother ... why do I try to love you / when you really don't want me to?\" She says all the things that we've wanted to say to the self-centered people in our lives. And she does it in a mid-tempo quirky clever way.The early hit from here, \"Hands Clean,\" is classic \"new\" Alanis -- simple, conversational lyrics, non-threatening hummable melody and a hook that sticks in your head. And for that reason, it's already become a radio favorite.Other standouts include \"Flinch\" -- raw emotion set with a sparse arrangement where her voice pierces and haunts. It's a kindred track to the earlier smash \"Uninvited.\" Another is \"Utopia.\" This is definitely a fan track -- very folksy and esoteric and sparse -- but it's clean and simple and lyrically inspiring in a John Lennon \"Imagine\" sort of way.My only issue here is that Alanis, since parting ways with Glen Ballard, has pursued her own writing. That's good in that it brings about honest, true-to-life lyrics, but Alanis has an annoying tendency to just write stream-of-consciousness. Whereas a lot of \"Jagged Little Pill\" was nonsense  (\"I'm like Estella ... I like to reel it in and then spit it out ... I'm consumed by your apathy ... slap me with a splintered ruler\") both \"Junkie\" and this disc feature things like \"We thought a break would be good ... for four moths we sat and vacillated ... we thought a small time apart would clear up the doubts that were abounding ... You knew you needed more time, time spent alone with no distraction, you felt you needed to fly solo and high to define what you wanted...\"The result is often clunky and unmelodic. Alanis ends up phrasing words awkwardly to get them to fit the music, which sometimes ruins the flow of the song. Thankfully, it's less of a problem here than in \"Junkie.\" Also, Alanis has a tremendous sense of melody, so she is able to craft songs that are hummable anyway -- and that's a gift.In short, this CD is playable, fun, catchy and brilliant. It's still in my player from the day I got it.\n", "val": 0.024620437994599342}

Not having been a fan of her Jagged Little Pill album, Infatuation surprised me with its maturity, its melodic perfection and its transcendent moments. Fortunately Under Rug Swept has the same qualities: great songs with poetic lyrics and addictive hooks! I love the confessional angle of her lyrics as they always encompass the universal and never get mired in mere solipsism. I can truly say that there's not one dud track on this album and even those songs that I'm not ecstatic about, like \"Flinch\", \"That Particular Time\" and \"A Man\" have memorable tunes, good lyrics and interesting arrangements. My favorites include the poignant \"So Unsexy\", the rousing \"Surrendering\" and the powerful \"21 Things\", and I love the pure pop delight of \"Precious Illusions\" and \"Utopia.\" If you liked the \"Infatuation\" album, you'll certainly enjoy this one.

{"text": "This is far less angry than her first two CDs. I have those too and think they are great. This is brilliant and different.She seems to have gone from anger at all men for being nasty to acceptance of the fact and resignation to it. She's a superb wordsmith, and I love the way she alters rhyme, reason, meter, pronunciation and acceptable accenting of words to fit with the tune.It starts with \"21 Things I Want in a Lover\" which to my mind are all perfectly reasonable requests for qualities in a partner for either sex. It's certainly what I've always tried to be.There follows a song called \"Narcissus\" which encapsulates many men who I think we all know.Then it is \"Hands Clean\" which is agonising in its relentless assault on your feelings for this poor girl remembering being treated so shoddily by a successful and insensitive man. It also goes to show how difficult it is to get over it when love ends.\"Flinch\" is simply superb. It shows again just how long it takes anyone to get over love (except, apparently, for the men in this distressed girl's life) and how the longing, and the anger at that longing, stays with you forever. It's simple disbelief that anyone can affect you as much as that.One of my favourites is \"So Unsexy\". It bites straight into me as I realise it is just like me with all that tormenting self-doubt; but at least it has hope at the end!\"Precious Illusions\" is also devastatingly accurate to all those people entering a relationship and wondering tentatively whether it will be as bad as whatever finished the last one. It's about wondering who you are and who you aren't and I simply love those last two lines!\"That Particular Time\" is so beautifully worded, quiet, gentle and broody. It speaks of needing time to marinate in what \"us\" meant and also the horrific realisation that sometimes staying with a person means betraying oneself.\"A Man\" seems to be a general gripe at men's attitudes. It has a lovely quality of rhythm to it. The poor lady certainly seems to have had her share of bad relationships!And then there's \"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\". This one makes me cry and feel so understood that there are others out there who feel this way about love.\"Surrendering\" again just says it all about those moments of self doubt at the start of a new relationship and the thrill of eventually being trusted and being able to trust.It ends with \"Utopia\" sung in a lovely lilting way and probably the best evocation of what heaven and peace on earth could be that I have ever heard.I like this CD! As I say, it's much more mellow than her other albums. Being a family man in his mid forties I'm probably not the intended audience, but if you have ever loved and lost, or just loved, you will find understanding and solace in the words here.I'm pleased for Ms. Morrisette that she is able to put down her feelings like this. If any of this is even half true then I think the poor lady would have gone mad without the benefits of this release!The technical side is excellent too, with gorgeous bass lines (played by one of about six bass players listed on the back!) and superb balance and order.I'm easily bored but have never been by this CD. That has never happened before.If you've ever loved someone so much you didn't know how to handle it, buy this CD and hear your feelings expressed in words.\n", "val": 0.017376789823174477}
{"text": "Still licking my wounds after the disappointment of Alanis' last studio outing (asides from Are You Still Mad?, Joining You & So Pure)which I felt struggled too much to differ from the uber-classic of Jagged Little Pill, the first chorus of this album's initial single Hands Clean, revitalised my interest in Alanis & hope that she would return to form.  Moreover, anytime you hear that an artist parts company with a manager or creative partner, you always think it means trouble.  Alanis' self-production of this opus made me fear for the worst.  Would she forgo her true sound?  Would she be able to reflect the verve that Glen Ballard helped her create?  This album has consolidated my hopes that Alanis would be better than before.  Phew!  From the opening confidence of 21 Things I Want In A Lover, the opening guitar rift gives me shivers, as does her multi-layered challenging 'Are you uninhibited in bed more than 3 times a week?', the vitriolicism is there, but with less anger than before. Classic song which will be mammoth, as it harks back to You Outha Know in its confidence & forth-right communication with Alanis' silent partner. The remainder of the album tend to veer towards a more relaxed Alanis.  No big rockers, but mid-tempo songs which allow Alanis to focus on her song-writing, & more importantly a decent chorus which doesn't contain more than 6000 syllables!!!! Another fave is Flinch, a tender ballad about letting go of a love & wondering if the painful feelings will be there later on (Soon I'll grow up, I won't even Flinch at your name).  Tragic, but personal one assumes. Alanis' voice on this album doesn't speak so much pain & rage which I felt the last 2 albums have (I've never indulged myself in her Tiffany-style music, & consider Jagged her first 'proper' album, as most do associate Control with Janet Jackson). However, the album does speak experience & sharing those feelings, or at least rationalising them out loud.  Precious Illusions & So Unsexy continue the difficulty of love theme with totall accessibility.  Remember as a youth lying on your bed identifying with the lyrics of Jagged Little Pill?  Well here's the next chapter which will help you on your merry way to further self-analysis.  Welcome back Alanis!!! This album will be a slow-burner & may take a bit of time to take off as audiences regain their faith in Alanis (although 8 million sales of the last album is by no means awful, but compared to the sales of Jagged you do note a stoop in audience interest I'm sorry to say).  21 Things & the remainder of the album should remind audiences who this gal is & moreover make them realise who exactly is at the wheel of her creative drive.  Glen who?????\n", "val": 0.00202381843701005}

There are a couple of nice ballads: \"Flinch\", \"That particular moment\", \"Precious illusions\" and \"Utopia\" (with it seems a beautiful hidden track straight at the end of the song?). \"21 Things I want in a lover\" and \"A Man\" with louder and heavier guitars are close to what she was offering on her previous albums. \"Narcissus\" has a nice contrast between the lower voice in the recitative verses and the chorus.\"Under the rug swept\" is like an old friend knocking on the door.

{"text": "After Alanis released her second album, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\", which is awsome, i thought that she would go on a creative and experimental rampage for her next recording. (Maybe she could do her own Sgt. Pepper's album, or maybe an elctro/acoustic performance with Cellos, Violins and the whole orchestra \"a la Bjork,\" or would just go Phish or Ani Difranco on the world, with a third album that would sell even less thant the second one.) Then \"Under Rug Swept\" came out and alas, she did experiment, but instead of drifting off into the wild world of dark-obscure-forget everything you know-nothing like my last records-experimentation she just went on the brighter-fitter-accesible-side.So, after a couple of years of guitar and bass lessons, Alanis comes with her third release that will manage to win back all those long lost \"Jagged Little Pill\" fans and recoup a horde of new fans along the way, without compromising her creativity or music in any way.The cd starts off with \"21 things\" which rocks, yet is tranquil enough to maintain its pop edge. Then comes \"Narcissus,\" which is probably the catchiest, happiest, most commercial, and my personal favourite song. This song is awsome, and i love rocking and moving to it, the lyrics are great to. \"Hands Clean\" may have been tedious at first, when they put it a couple hundred times on mtv and the radio, but after a while it just made sense. The lyrics are wise (they are all inverted perspective-wise) and bold, and trust me, after a while youll love it.\"so unsexy\" \"that particular time\" and \"utopia\" are probably the best songs on the album. They are moving, smart, and will transmit all sorts of emotions to your body. These three songs, musically are creative yet simple, and the lyrics are touching, direct, and beautiful. Let me tell you something these 3 songs will make you love the cd.The only 2 songs i don't like are \"flinch\" and \"you owe me nothing in return.\" Flinch is catchy yet something i do not appreciate about it for the lyrics are boring and i do not connect to them, while the later song has cheesy lyrics and a boring structure musically. Even though, these songs might prove to be of your liking, and maybe someday to mine.All in all this is a 4 and 1/2 record. So its commercial and accesible, and not what you expected, but trust me, you have not heard this record just by listening to \"hands clean,\" there is a deep hidden feeling in this recording that makes you shine after youve heard it. This record is probably not what any of us expected, but let me tell you something, it goes to a different level, a level where our expectations do not matter.This is a great and awsome record, and you will not get tired of it.\n", "val": 0.01109325885772705}

Her energy and originality from previous albums are totally missing in action here... With everything - her songwriting, lyrics, use of voice, production - taking direction towards the superficial and mainstream on \"Under rug swept\", this exceptional music master mind has reduced herself to being just another pop artist. A massive disappointment, I'll have to say. Even her bandmembers have been exchanged, she has \"hipped\" up her stage with barenaked machomen so that her new concert audience of 14 year old girls will find something to lay their eyes on as well. The only song which isn't annoyingly easy to like (and consequently impossible to love) is \"A man\". I simply can't belive this - after the extraordinary divine \"supposed..\", I would never have dreamt of her taking this direction.

{"text": "In my review of \"Supposed Former Infactuation Junkie,\" Alanis Morissette's previous CD, I mentioned how difficult it was to follow up the monster success of her \"Jagged Little Pill\" CD of 1995. \"Pill\" was a snarling, vengeful CD that brought out the best in Alanis and was embraced by the public. \"Junkie\" was a respectful, albeit weaker effort, that still sold 4 million copies and included a couple of great songs. Enough time has passed since 1995 and Alains should be out of \"Pill's\" shadow. But \"Under Rug Swept\" is such a weak album, it just isn't in the same class as even \"Junkie.\"  Things get off to a good start with \"21 Things I Want in a Lover,\" which is sort of a \"You Outta Know\" retread  but it works just the same. \"Hands Clean\" is effective as well but by track 4 this CD goes into a tailspin that it never pulls out of. Alanis' voice isn't the problem - the material is simply second rate.

{"text": "'Under Rug Swept' is yet another distinctive album from Alanis.  She was popular with her ranting in 'Jagged' and experienced the polar attitudes of disillusionment and total devotion that 'Supposed Former' caused within her listening audience.  I think 'Under Rug Swept' is much more accessible than 'Supposed Former' but does not lose the emotion or intensity of that album.The album starts with the more marketable songs like \"21 Things I Want in a Lover,\" \"Narcissus,\" \"Precious Illusions,\" and \"Hands Clean.\"  By more marketable I mean that they have catchy refrains in a rock/pop style of music.  The lyrics are still up to par with the emotion and cleverness we have come to love in Alanis.  My favorite of this group is \"Narcissus\" which has biting lyrics but with a touch of irony and regret.The rest of the album is much more reflective on Alanis's artistic abilities as well as her personal issues.  The songs tend to be much more focused upon lyrics rather than the music.  Granted, the music is much more important throughout this album as compared her other albums.  For some, this half of the album would be less enjoyable, but I do find it just as listenable.  \"You Owe Me Nothing\" is a song that portrays real love in the best way I've heard any artist portray love... and that's saying a lot.I really do think that not only is \"Under Rug Swept\" accessible for a fairly broad audience, but is Alanis's best album musically.  I gave it four stars for the reason that it is so short and she recorded so many great songs for it but cut them.  I realize why she wanted to make the record concise, but I can't tell you how disappointed I'll be if a second record isn't released with my favorite B-Sides from this album such as \"Sister Blister,\" \"Symptoms,\" and \"Fear of Bliss.\"\n", "val": 0.013334889896214008}

While _some_ of those men may, in fact, be nothing more than pigs, it gets repetitive to hear one of your favorite rock stars th about that thru 11 songs on the new album you just paid good money for.I have always been one to appreciate Alanis' critical view of things and her sense of freedom. I have always admired her resistance to stupid social standards, weird cultural things, and even ego-maniac men, among other things. All this, of course, is based on her public image that she portrays thru her songs and interviews. But I can't justify the price of this CD for only the following three songs. I would wait and hope for singles and buy those.#3 - Hands Clean. This is a very good song. Musically it's nothing great. Just the good ol' processed guitar sounds in the background. And the drums? She probably went back to using the drum machines that she first used.9 - You Owe Me Nothing In Return. Now _this_ is what an amazing song sounds like. It has very powerful lyrics and very nice music accompanying it.11 - Utopia. This is a nice song. Not something mind blowing but just a nice song with a nice music flow.All the other songs can be heard by tuning in to the latest broadcast of your local feminist male-haters. :)I hope her next album is like infatuation junkie or better.

So unsexy is i think a hand in my pocket 2 and is her next single. This time you see her more venture into slow territory but they come out realy winners.

{"text": "If you haven't noticed, \"Under Rug Swept\" is not produced by Glen Ballard (as were her last two albums) but is produced by no one other than herself. In my opinion she's done a fabulous, if not better job without his direction. She's come a long way since the widely successful \"Jagged Little Pill\" and the supposed founder-of-oneself on \"Supposed Former Infactuation Junkie\", but it isn't until you hear \"Under Rug Swept\" that you feel just how happy she truly is. That's why it's so sad to find a lot of die-hard \"Jagged Little Pill\" fans becoming more and more disappointed with each new release. The good thing, however, is how all of her \"true fans\" are growing with her and loving every step of it. She just seems so comfortable and confident with this album, which I believe to be the goal she was striving for.Much like her last album she experiments with different sounds but here she broadens everything, taking it the extra mile. She even has Flea of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers play bass on the second song \"Narcissus\". It's \"Hands Clean\" (her first single), however, that captures the listener, only getting better as it moves along. Her apparent secong single \"So Unsexy\" is the next notable highlight but my favorites have got to be the aggressive guitar filled \"A Man\", the new-agey piano-induced \"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\" (which is my absolute favorite!), and the powerful \"Utopia\" which is sang with passionate grace.Another bonus to this CD is the secret website which includes: Utopia Lyrics, a letter from Alanis, the Making of Hands Clean, Exclusive audio tracks such as Flinch (live at the Whisky in LA) and a brand new song (which I believe will be changing periodically on the website) called Sister Bliss...\n", "val": 0.015916788950562477}
{"text": "After Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie I was a abit leary to buy Alanis' latest release. I haven't been dissapointed. The single \"Hands Clean\" is lyrically brilliant, albit a bit awkwardly phrased at times. I believe the standout track to be \"So Unsexy\", perhaps the most emotionally accessible song for listeners. The song touches on those moments when we feel incapacitated to  be who we are, feeling so unsexy but being so beautiful. The Me'shell Ndegeocello bassline in this track punches the lyrics in a smart and efficient manner. Definitely a standout. I wish I could comment on more of the album, but I'm slowly digesting track by track, but I have no doubt listeners familiar with Alanis' work will NOT be dissapointed with this latest release. Alanis should be proud of this compilation - it's the most touching and (seemingly) personal album to date.rave on.jason.\n", "val": 0.023865297436714172}

{"text": "Alanis Morissette is truly a one of a kind artist. An amazing voice and a knack for creating beautifully introspective songs from [an angry] near hippie girl's point of view has set her apart from other female singer/songwriters. Her latest Under Rug Swept still supports these statements, but confirms one flaw she is guilty of: playing the role of psychologist. Too often Alanis over analyzes and it just all turns into one pile of psycho-mush. She means well, and on such songs as \"Narcissus\" and \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\", she succeeds in being a deep thinker without sounding like an emotionally drained sad sack. She mentions the dos and donts if you want to be hers in \"21 Things\" within pounding rock. The song is one of the album's catchiest cuts. On \"Narcissus\", she talks about a guy getting his butt licked by his mother and other no nos if you want to be Alanis' sugar daddy. Shes got pretty interesting stuff here, as interesting as the previous albums, both of which held every possible emotion-anger, irony,love, and such acts as walking naked in living rooms, and thanking India for enlightenment. Under Rug Swept doesnt seem as inspired in some places, but the high notes it does hit are pretty killer. The first single \"Hands Clean\", about a forbidden relationship, is as accessible as \"Head Over Feet\" or \"You Learn\"; \"A Man\" rocks hard, and \"That Particular Time\" is reminiscent of \"That I Would Be Good\". While this new rug hits a few snags, it well worth a peek at what she actually swept under it-which after all that excessive deep thinking turns out to be quite interesting for a third time.\n", "val": 0.020680824294686317}

This, unfortunately is exactly the fate that Alanis suffered with Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. What sets her apart, however, is this third album which, I am very pleased to announce, is every bit as good as Jagged Little Pill. On this album, she goes back to catchy melodies, deep-seated, emotionally charged lyrics, and memorable, radio-friendly songs. Every song is an original hit, but the first 6 are simply outstanding. In short, if you are a fan of Jagged Little Pill, you will defintely love this album.Alanis has been accused of many things over the years including putting on a false-front, bashing men, and selling out her emotions. But whether you love her or you hate her, you have to respect the fact that her songs are downright fantastic. And you also have to acknowledge that she is no fly-by-night artist.

I was intrigued by the catchiness of her songs and moved by the true emotion and pain that her voice projected. My favorite album of Alanis's was her second, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" in which she took her spiritual, emotional, and musical journey to an entirely new level; crafting songs that juxtaposed loud guitar riffs with calm, acoustic melodies. I was DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED, however, in her latest release, \"Under Rug Swept,\" because I found its musical and lyrical content to be highly contrived, recycled, and mundane. Alanis has morphed from an edgy alternative-rocker to a bland adult contemporary artist. I was ready to hand this album over to my easy-listening mother after hearing it for the first time. Alanis had edge and diversity in her past two albums, reflecting on every human issue possible from spiritual misguidance to suicide. Her latest simply focuses on her failed relationships with men and explores no new territory either lyrically or musically. I hope she sweeps this album under the rug and resurfaces with a more lustrous and memorable effort.\n", "val": 0.008817254565656185}

And of course the hit \"Hands Clean.\" A personal story of a relationship with an older man. More beautiful tracks are on this CD of course, from the strengthening \"Narcissus\" and the extremely emotional and chilling \"That Particular Time.\"I find it so incredible that even though the songs are so personal, it is possible to relate to every song- and most definitely- sing along again and again.This album is insanely magical!feel free to email me for questions!\n", "val": 0.06770172715187073}

So Unsexy is a great ballad about how we can allow a person to make us feel so unsexy and insignificant.  At that particular time is a good song about  the  different stages in a relationship.

I'm Alanis Fan #19,000,001. So this is brutal honesty I'm spouting here.With this third album, Alanis has gone from each album: Extremely Catchy, Catchy, Not catchy. I do not understand why everyone has written such glowing reviews of \"Under Rug Swept\". ROLLINGSTONE does it to help sell records for its cover artists, but what's your excuse?First off, what's good: \"Hands Clean\" is a good leadoff single, since it's the only song that has a tune. With her usual oozing intellectual words for the average listener, we hear about another facet of relationship. With that exuberant voice and music, who could resist?This is where my praise ends. Okay, \"Unsexy\" is almost as catchy for the very same reasons as \"Hands Clean\". But all the other songs are manic and forgettable--something you could blab to a therapist and forget the next day: \"21 Things I want in a Lover\" is vintage/marginal Alanis--we've heard it before, but better. \"Narcissus\" is something anyone can come up with while walking down the street. \"A Man\" is just weird in a bad way. \"Utopia\" is cheesy cuz of all the layered vocals. \"Flinch\" and \"That Particular Time\" are embarassingly dull--could Alanis revise her lyrics more please ?I love Alanis, but she really missed the boat this time.

{"text": "Alanis Morissette once again changes images with the release of her third major album, UNDER RUG SWEPT.  Morissette's image on JAGGED LITTLE PILL is the angry alt-rocker, furious at men for being such pigs and lowlifes.  On SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKY, she has wedded her image to a deep sense of spirituality.  UNDER RUG SWEPT takes these two images and combines them in a deft move of maturity.UNDER RUG SWEPT reads like an autobiography of Morissette's love life with a definite progression of lyrical themes, climaxing in the last track \"Utopia\".On the album, you won't find anger like you did on JAGGED LITTLE PILL's most powerful tracks, though you will find pain.  You won't find the SFIJ's rich spirituality save for \"Utopia\".  Instead, UNDER RUG SWEPT gives us a very traceable narrative.This narrative begins by Morissette defining what she wants in a lover.  She hooks up with a music exec (described angrily in JAGGED LITTLE PILL's track \"Right Through You\") who has underage sex with her in \"Hands Clean.\"  In \"Right Through You,\" Morissette is very angry, but \"Hands Clean\" is almost journalistic in approach.Morissette explores the negative impact of this situation in the next two tracks, \"Flinch\" and \"So Unsexy.\"  In \"Flinch,\" Morissette talks about how she is trying hard not to flinch at his name.  In \"So Unsexy,\" she says it's been almost a decade and still hurts, which for me definitely links this track \"Hands Clean.\"Eventually, Morissette finds a lover (\"That Particular Time), but they need time apart.  The relationship is complex, and you get the his viewpoint in the guitar-heavy track \"A Man.\"  She tells him she loves him and will do whatever it takes for him to be happy, and in the end they live in Utopia.  \"Utopia\" sounds more like her hopes and dreams, and here the album ceases its narrative style and turns into a very hopeful and optimistic view of what the world could be like. While novelistic songwriting is fascinating, Morissette' songs can be too easily construed as clich-driven.  Rolling Stones' review said UNDER RUG SWEPT had enough clichs to make up a whole season of Oprah. Hearing the songs outside the album's context, Morissette has indeed turned from an original writing style to rather blah psychobabble, sounding like the Democratic Party's singing mascot.  All of UNDER RUG SWEPT's songs rely on each other for context, especially \"Hands Clean.\"  She says plainly in the early part of her career, she and one of her mentors had an inappropriate relationship, and she's had to live with that.  Just hearing the song without knowing the album, you think she is just trying to push the limits.  The album, however, makes it quite clear the negative effects it has had. Overall, a fascinating album that, once you understand what she is doing, proves to be a rewarding and fulfilling listening experience.  Without understanding, however, UNDER RUG SWEPT appears as an artistic stumble.  Once you realise what's going on, Morissette proves herself once again as a valid and intriguing musical artist.P. S.  Just a few thoughts about Glen Ballard and his relationship with Morissette.For those who speculate that the music exec Morissette is singing about in \"Hands Clean\" is Glen Ballard, and I think I can very safely say this, is just flat out wrong.  Glen Ballard produced her 1995 JAGGED LITTLE PILL.  Morissette was 21 when PILL was released.  What many Americans don't know is Morissette had a musical career in Canada, and her debut album was released in 1991.  Morissette had appeared on a star finding program.  When she was ten, Morissette starred as a regular cast member of the television show \"You Can't Do That On TV.\"Morissette, however, wanted to be in the music industry, so she used the show as a stepping stone both financially and public relation-wise.  She had signed a music publishing contract the age of 14, and the video of `Hands Clean\" clearly links the song with the early years of her career.Chronologically, the conclusion that Glen Ballard is the one who had under-age sex with Morissette simply does not add up.  This conclusion also ignores lyrical indicators in both PILL and UNDER RUG SWEPT as well.  In \"Right Through You,\" she sings about the exec scanning the credits and wonder why he's not there.  Glen Ballard is listed and fully credited as producer.  \"Right Through You\" also tells us this happened much earlier than her teaming with Ballard.  Had it been Ballard, I don't think Morissette would have let him produce not one but two records, with three years separating the two.UNDER RUG SWEPT makes it quite clear the situation has caused her a lot of pain.  I do not think it would have been possible for her to have a professional working relationship with Ballard over the course of two records that have such a vast time-span between them.  It took three years for her to deliver PILL's follow-up.  With the emotional trauma she has experienced, do you really think Morissette would let him helm up two of her three records?  I don't think so.  Chronologically it doesn't add up either.  This leads me to the conclusion whoever the music exec is, it's definitely not Glen Ballard.\n", "val": 0.016294771805405617}

It's just there - sort of like fluffer material.I still love this woman's honesty and her powerful lyrics - they are present throughout this album, but it's just not a complete package in my opinion.\n", "val": 0.0003801349375862628}

This album is not quite as angry as the first, but not as mellow as the second. Fans need to realize that the best musicians don't simply try to rehash old material, but coninuously try to reninvent themselves. Just look at such artist as Neil Young and Bob Dylan. I really like the songs Flinch, so Unsexy and Hands Clean. This album should have many hit singles, and let's hope it helps to usher in a new era of the singer/songwriter that has gotten lost in the current trends of pop music.\n", "val": 0.0023020559456199408}
{"text": "After loving Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, I was hoping for something a little more unlike Jagged Little Pill.  Under Rug Swept stands on its own musically, but lyrics-wise, it's the same self-absorbed trip.  A track called \"Narcissus\" is the final straw.  Who is this material directed at?  Women who have been totally worked over by horrible guys?  Are normal guys who treat their wives and girlfriends with respect expected to listen to this...?  Maybe Alanis doesn't think such men exist. If I want to hear endless litanies about my deficiencies as a male, I'll hang out with my ex-wife.  I guess this is why I prefer women artists like Bjork and Jane Siberry.\n", "val": 6.742221012245864e-05}
{"text": "In the mid-90's Alanis Morissette's angry alternative rock struck a chord with many, and \"Jagged Little Pill\" went on to become the biggest-selling debut album of all time by a female artist. Of course, not all of us were anxious to have a 22-year-old girl tell us just how ticked off she was about this, that, or the other. And for whatever fans \"Pill\" didn't make, its followup, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" with its lone hit \"Thank U,\" didn't exactly sway the vote either. However her third offering, \"Under Rug Swept,\" seems poised to expand her fan base.For starters, she's not just asserting honest emotions this time, but a distinct artistry as well. She produced the set herself, and power pop guru Glen Ballard seems nowhere to be found; Alanis instantly dispells any notion that will harm things, however, as the irresistible leadoff track \"21 Things I Want in a Lover\" proves she's ready to reclaim a spot in radio. The album's actual first single, \"Hands Clean,\" is just as sharp and catchy, and, like the equally hit-ready \"Precious Illusions,\" even though the lyrics tell of a love gone wrong, she isn't so much telling the guy off as she is expressing reactions. Through it all, the sound is still a powerful one but the edges are ever so slightly rounded off; a subtlely more feminine approach that Ballard never offered her.  Perhaps part of the reason for this is, without Ballard to produce and co-write, some of Morissette's influences are coming through stronger, such as Sarah McLachlan and The Sundays.But her growth isn't found solely in production. \"A Man\" offers a slow-burning, pulsating rock groove over a compellingly spiritual lyric, while \"Utopia\" finds her singing sweetly in a Sarah McLachlan-ish register over a chorus of acoustic guitars about her ideas of how to make the world a better place. Both songs are unfortunately uncommercial but also provide irresistible listens. And \"That Particular Time,\" with its haunting piano and elegant melody, clearly shows an artist in evolution.But to see how far she has truly come, one has to listen to no more than the achingly gorgeous ballad \"Flinch.\" Sounding deceptively simple, Alanis uses a beautiful acoustic melody to lament a love affair she just can't get over. In the song, some time has apparently gone by since the breakup, and she mentions her brother running into the ex, singing \"I'd be paralyzed if I ran into you/my tongue would sieze up if we were to meet again.\" Had this been \"Jagged Little Pill,\" she probably would have asked her brother where he saw the guy so she could be sure to run into him on purpose. But now Alanis opens up her emotional accessibility so far as to let us see a vulnerable, and therefore beautiful, resigned sadness. It's bravery like this, without the need to scream it in our face as she once did, that makes the album so impressive. In the same song, Alanis sings, \"some day I'll grow up,\" but what makes \"Under Rug Swept\" such a compelling listen is the fact that her maturity has clearly already begun.\n", "val": 0.0129937045276165}
{"text": "Alanis Morissette gets into the carpet where most generic brands of vacuum do not. \"Under Rug Swept\" is the third testament to Morissette's capable songwriting abilities. Look between the fibers of \"Flinch\" and \"Hands Clean\" (according to Morissette it's told from the other person's point of view, which few songwriter's even think about trying). While the penmanship is poignant, the music fails to capture the immediacy of 1995's \"Jagged Little Pill\". This is, after all, Morissette's third cd for a major label, and haven't we been here before? The musical riffs fit like a well trodden carpet, and it could be said that musical experimentation isn't one of Alanis's strong points. Yet, the music here is entertaining like the old fashioned chorus of \"Narcissus\" or the trance beats of \"Surrendering\". The one thing fans will take with them is Morissette's heartfelt lyrics. This is the grit in the carpet that will continue to draw crowds. Few musicians covet their shag carpeting, often choosing stain resistant approaches to music and lyrics. \"Under Rug Swept\" is as durable as an old shag alright, right down to the 70's-looking cd cover. Perhaps Morissette might consider working with a Peter Gabriel or fellow Canadian Robbie Robertson next time out. It might give new musical direction and keep fans glued to the floor.

{"text": "Alanis Morissette's latest effort \"Under Rug Swept\" brings her progression as an artist full circle.  Starting with the feminine angst driven and post-teen disenchantment of Jagged Little Pill; continuing with the sagacious, inspiring, alluring, and authenticity of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie; and progressing with \"Under Rug Swept,\" an album where Alanis puts on a sensual and human interaction hat.21 Things displays a sort of sensual passion that works attractively with Alanis.  The loud guitar and bluntly said prerequisites and check-list orientated requirements are both tongue-and-cheek and revealing, as the listener sees a bit more of Alanis's moral composition.Narcissus is a critical track that is a musical masterpiece.  It's written in the format of carping little notes to various \"boys,\" such as \"egotist boy\" and \"narcissus boy.\"  The lyrical quality is amazing and complements the stunning arrangement perfectly.  A perfect balance between rock and easy listening.Hands Clean is the first and current single and an intriguing one that everyone has been trying to interpret.  Some say it's a recollection of Alanis's life in the recording business; while most simply deem it as an interesting synopsis of a relationship plucked out of the plethora of alluring associations Alanis has had over her mere 27 years.  Hands Clean is a remarkably strong piece that shows that Alanis can produce a hit without having it backed with loud drums and a roaring guitar.  The bridge:  \"what part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept? / what part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?\" will sweep your breath away.Flinch, the longest track on the album at just over six minutes, is a breathtakingly simple song that affects the listener as only previous songs like \"Front Row\" could.  Although Alanis choose a more country theme for the song, I found myself really enjoying it.  Describing a relationship and its effects, Flinch is an amazing song backed with stunning lyrics.  Self-disbelief and the effects of rejection are somewhat new topics for Alanis, but she discusses them remarkably well and doesn't sound querulous or too melancholy while she does.So Unsexy is definitely geared to be a single, yet is a very good song that almost makes you feel sorry of Alanis's seemingly lack of self-belief and confidence during the certain incidence she describes, but I think we've all felt it at some time.Track 6, Precious Illusions, is yet another song geared to be a single, but happens to be the best song \"Under Rug Swept\" offers.  Alanis looks back, describing the illusions she keeps about life and accomplishment, and it's a highly authentic, relatable, and applicable song that many of us can relate to.Track 7, That Particular Time, is an absolutely amazing, low key piece that demands eventual notice with its stunning, gentle piano and Alanis's heart wrenching vocals, comparative to \"Your Congratulations.\"  Alanis describes a \"time\" where the relationship she was in presented her with quite a desperate emotional quandary and she comments on the partner who acted as a catalyst to this quandary.A Man is the only other rock track on the album, but occupies its position will a soaring melody and powerful delivery.  Its lyrics exhibit Alanis's ability to play different roles in her music.  (Other rock tracks are featured on the Hands Clean import singles.)You Owe Me Nothing in Return describes what Alanis expects in reciprocation from her partner and is accompanied with magnificent instrumentation that couples with the lyrics to create an unbelievable song.  The content of the song is that of almost of a dismissive, selfless Alanis that may contradict some of her earlier ideals showcased in such songs as \"Pollyanna Flower,\" but then Alanis could always be infusing the song with a little esoteric deciphering as well.Surrendering is a brilliant track that once again talks about human interactions on a personal level but does so with attention paid to the other person and the role that Alanis plays in his life.  With Alanis breathy vocals, it makes for an exciting track.Utopia describes Alanis's \"ideal\" situation and is beautiful, peaceful, and has stunning multi-layering of voices, which really highlights the simplistic beauty of Alanis's voice.At eleven tracks, this cd isn't particularly long and is rather isolated in its focus.  The constant references to relationships and their affects may be a bit of an adjustment from the passion and earnest questioning/gradual affirmation of \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" but the songs have grand melodies and easily learned lyrics.  Alanis shows that she's still sensual, even if she wore the hat of sage beautifully and grandly.  Her voice is different on the various tracks, sometimes more \"Supposed\" and sometimes more \"Jagged,\" and excitingly enough, something new.  She also produced the entire album and wrote it (with lyrics that tend to demand decryption and feature a stellar use of the English language).  For Alanis's continued progression as an artist and constant creativity, Under Rug Swept easily merits 5 stars in my book.Track listing:  1. 21 Things I want in a Lover (3:28)  2.

{"text": "ALANIS MORISSETTE became an iconic rock star with her trademark yodels in her best-selling Jagged Little Pill and mellowed into the spiritual void with her Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie that was a sales embarrassment juxtaposed to her first outing. Frankly I am neither an ardent fan of Alanis or rock songs yet I bought her third album UNDER RUG SWEPT out of pure admiration.I am supportive of artiste who are courageous enough to single handedly take over the creative license and production. Ms. Morissette moreover juggles a difficult job of balancing her artistic side with commercialism. Her songs boast a fantastic synchronization of acoustic with beats, complimenting lilting melodies especially in tracks such as \"Hands Clean\", \"So unsexy\" and \"Narcissus\". Under the Rug Swept may have lost the spiritual edge in her previous efforts, yet its raw and original lyrics on her thoughts in life and past experiences astounds even though the incoherent syntax may have marred the fluidity in the melodies.\"21 things I want in a lover\" speaks about her unattainable expectations in man; \"Narcissus\" is a parody of egoistic men, \"Hands Clean\" speaks of her past affair with an older man and \"Utopia\" pens her thoughts on the World Trade Center tragedy. The standout track is of course \"Flinch\" where her powerless attraction and desperation is brutally honest. It is seldom that an artiste expresses a myriad of opinions besides shallow views on love and betrayal. This is pop rock that is more accessible yet of sincerity.Alanis effortlessly segues from one rocking rhythm to crooning alternative ballads with her own brand of despair.

Then she presents us with Narcissus, which is the closest thing she has ever done to a disposable track - mainly because of the jumbled and anti-climactic chorus. Mercifully, this is followed by the mighty Hands Clean, which is quintessential Alanis.Perhaps more than any other album, Rug showcases the finer side of Alanis' vocals, both lead and harmony, and there are many well constructed tracks, from ballads such as Flinch to heavier numbers such as 21 Things and A Man.For my money, the album should have ended with Surrendering and the weaker Utopia should have been shuffled backwards in the running order.Full marks to Maverick for giving us a tasteful, arty cover - a great relief after the ghastly debacle of the Infatuation Junkie cover.This album, both lyrically and musically, reinforces Alanis' importance as a major female Rock artist and role model, and to this degree, completely vindicates my featuring of her several times in my first book.Rock Goddess?

They sound generic, canned--like someone was programming them who didn't really have the touch for producing good beats. And they stay the same throughout the entire song! No dynamics, no awareness of the riff being played above them; they don't add to the music; they merely provide a background.Jagged Little Pill and Infatuation Junkie had clear personalities complete with interesting (if somewhat nonsensical on Junkie) lyrics. Swept has cardboard characters and philosophical sentiments taken from self-help books. Alanis needs to go out and *live* her life, not sit around all day at home and read.Other than 21 Things and Narcissus, this record just wanders around, and even those two songs could have been killer if Glen Ballard had worked his magic on them. Next time, Alanis needs to put somebody in the control room who has the chops to record complex albums. If not Ballard, she might consider Butch Vig.Fanboys and Fangirls will slobber all over this record, and then go back to listening to Jagged Little Pill just like the rest of us. Alanis will either break out in a new direction on her next record, or she'll slip into the same oblivion most of the other 90s rock chicks did. Based on the progression of albums I've seen so far, I'm guessing it's oblivion for her.Robert St. James\n", "val": 2.055408367596101e-05}
{"text": "Alanis Morissette has truly shown her maturity with the new CD Under Rug Swept, this album reflects many personal events that have happened to her throughout her life. Dedicated fans have followed Alanis from her wild \"angry woman\" type of songs in Jagged Little Pill to her more subtle attitude with a hint of coping with her previous frustrations in relationships with Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, as well as the moving single Uninvited ,which helped the horrible movie City of Angles gain viewership. This album shows the side of Alanis that many have been wating to see, her emotional side that has learned to cope with failed relationships, and personal torture that she sometimes subjects herself to. I love it, and Love every song she has ever sang. Alanis tells it like it is and it is with this truth and honesty that makes Alanis Morissette a true pioneer in the music industry. For Alanis to stop singing and making album would be a shame for us avid listeners, but I would not be suprised if she took a while for a new CD to come out because unlike money hungry singers who sing cheep and shallow teenie booper songs to make a quick buck, Alanis sings what she feels and wants to express herself that way. Her messages are powerful and deep, poetically she is a shakespeare, religiously she is like the Dali Lama. Props to Alanis and this CD, I have followed Alanis from her first CD and will continue to until the day (hopefully never) she decides to quit.\n", "val": 0.025874720886349678}
{"text": "\"Under Rug Swept\" is the kind of CD you will listen to several times in your life. It's authentic, simple and true. It reveals a new phase in alanis life. After the fury of \"jagged little pill\", the peace of mind of \"supposed former infactuated\", alanis comes back, with her new songs.The most interesting thing about alanis is that she gets intimate with her public, revealing all her personal experiences in relationships. I see it as a huge Psychological therapy for her, since making music is a way to elaborate her own personal questions, helping people to find a way out.If \"jagged\" was a protest album, with intriguing questions, \"supossed former\" was a peaceful CD after the storm she went through, I can define \"under rug swept\" as a nice try of alanis to find out who she is.\"21 things I want in a lover\" is a song that talks about Mr.perfect in alanis'point of view, which is something impossible to find in real life. \"Narcissus\" talks about an imature man, who is not ready to have a relationship. \"Hands clean\", the first single, is an imediate hit. It's pure pop, simple and direct, though it is based on a relationship alanis had with an older man when she was very young. It's written like a dialog: he speaks, she answers him. \"Flinch\" is a great ballad, very powerful, showing how hard a breakup can be. It's kind of mellow and sometimes boring, but it's great. \"So unsexy\" is very interesting song, showing alanis as a critic of herself, with all women's insecurities and doubts. \"Precious Illusions\" has a great chorus, and is very constructive. \"That particular time\" is a slow song, which repeats the title over and over, so that you can assimilate what alanis is trying to say. \"A man\" is alanis seeing herself as a man, with all masculine desires and lots of chauvinism sentences. \"You owe me nothing in return\" is a balance of failed relatioships, with pain and reciprocal offenses. A great lesson to be learned. \"Surrendering\" is a great song with calls attention beacuse of its structure. It starts slow, growing towards the great chorus. \"Utopia\" is the perfect song to understand the actual world conflicts, so that alanis put it in her official site right after sept 11 attack.Alanis is a great artist and this CD is a must-have item for all those people who appreciate good music and like to question themselves about life issues, just like alanis does.\n", "val": 0.027622129768133163}
{"text": "Alanis repeats the same mistake each time an album others is out. She tries to say too much in too little time. On her last effort, 17 songs had thousands of words, but it's ok then cos some of the songs were really amazing and feature a more matured production, featuring a diverse Indian sound, electronica, and dance/rock.On Under Rug Swept, the decision to release Hands Clean as the first single still goes to show how much she intends to reach the masses with a rather radio-friendly track. Elsewhere on the album, 21 Things might sound like a nice edgy guitar-rock track, reminiscent of her Pill days. On Narcissus, Alanis works her voice into a melancholic winner and brings out the emotional depth in the song. The danger of Alanis goin with it alone is that she oftens get into a self-obsessed mode where she waxes lyrical but often ends up deep within herself that alienates her listners. What's she trying to tell us? By the time you get through with Alanis, you'll be as vexed as our rock princess. the best track here must be the concluding track Upotia, that features a strip-down, nearer to acoustic sound. On this album, Alanis does score by not over-using her voice to a screech.Not a terribly fabulous album but nonetheless true to its roots. Not likely a 15 million seller but will just do well. Overall, a controlled delivery as always but too many things to say in too little time.\n", "val": 0.007734718266874552}

Alanis once again delivers with her unique ability to combine melodic riffs and enchanting hooks with powerful lyrics that will stay swiming in your head long after you are done listening.

{"text": "As a fan of Alanis since her jagged pill days, I can say this new album doesn't disappoint. It's great music from a most amazing artist. Her music is uncomparable to anyone out there, which is why I love it so much.This CD is strong, condensed, considering her last album boasted a heavy 17 tracks. This one offers up 11 strong songs that deal with relationships. The songs do reflect more of \"Jagged Little Pill\" than that of her second album. But none the less it's an entirely new album, which is what I expect from Alanis. So don't buy it expecting to get Jagged Pill 2. This album stands alone as all her albums do.Stand out tracks include:\"Hands Clean\" the first single which is just a great song all around. While it is radio friendly, that doesn't mean it should be counted out as a truly powerful song.\"Flinch\" which is even more powerful and strong. It's a great song that reflects truly on relationships with everyone.\"So Unsexy\" this is one of my favorites, it's great chorus just pulls you through this truly expressive song.\"That Particular Time\" is another favorite. It's a power ballad that is so beautiful and compelling.I highly recommend this album to all Alanis fans. She's an amazing artist and songwriter who is a constant inspiration for me.

Overall, the album is both, powerful and beautiful. Starting with a \"21 things I want in a love\" full of force, it goes on to do some of Alanis' most beautiful works with \"Flinch,\" \"So Unsexy\" and \"You owe me nothing in return,\" all of which are bound to become great hits, I'm sure.

{"text": "This is a gloriously average CD, and if I could award UNDER RUG SWEPT with 3 1/2 stars, I would.  To say this effort isn't as good as JAGGED LITTLE PILL or even SUPPOSED FORMER... isn't saying much as JLP was one of the best albums ever to be released, and SFIJ was an outstanding follow-up.  UNDER RUG SWEPT is 1/2 well thought out and brilliantly executed, and 1/2 \"I've got to hit 'skip track,' because this song is going to make me fall asleep at the wheel.\"The album begins with \"21 Things I Want in a Lover,\" one of UNDER RUG SWEPT's highlights.  It's edgy pop/rock sound and up tempo are greatly lacking in many of the other tracks.  Other highlights include the over radio swept \"Hands Clean\" and the poetic twists & turns found in \"So Unsexy.\"  As a poet, I don't throw the word \"poetic\" out easily.  There really is something cathartic in the above songs, and I even found myself tearing up at the lyrics of \"So Unsexy\" upon first listen.  Take for example when Morissette sings, \"I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful/so unloved for someone so fine/I can feel so boring for someone so interesting/so ignorant for someone of sound mind.\"  Come on, this girl has got her fingers on the pulse of language and feeling.  Currently, I think the strongest track on the CD is \"Narcissus\" in which Morissette goes back to what she does best, berate men for love gone wrong.  I love the courage found in lines like, \"Dear momma's boy/I know you had your butt licked by your mother.\"  Hoorah Alanis! Is this pandering? Perhaps, but the edgy lyrics combined with an electronic backbone really catapult this song into something special.Unfortunately, the rest of the album fizzles out.  Take for example \"Flinch\" in which Morissette berates a man who belittled her, which is the kind of stuff I love in lyrics, but not accompanied by a ballad or a downtrodden beat.  This example sets the tone for the remaining tracks on the CD, and while I don't think the negatives outweigh the benefits on UNDER RUG SWEPT, I will say- \"Buyer Beware: This is not Morissette at her best!\"  Not even close, but it's much better than a lot of the other efforts made this year, which has been such a lousy year for music.I'd like to end on a positive note, so...As always with Morissette, the lyrics are beautifully crafted, even in the songs that might put you to sleep, and I don't think I can ever get enough of Morissette's strange word play with syll/a/bles.  While some might find her syntax annoying, I applaud her creativity and experimentation.  Definitely a good buy.  Just not a great one.\n", "val": 0.005149861332029104}
{"text": "Alanis Morissette. What does the name mean to you? To me, Alanis is a woman who has crossed the lines time and time again, she's made a name for herself with real music and without stripping down to a thong in the process. (Always a plus!)On this little gem, Alanis continues with her old sound, but not rigidly.The opening track is one of the harder rock numbers, in it Alanis spits off the 21 things she looks for in her dream guy. With the fierce acoustics and soft prose, it's a song you have to hear. (And adore)*****Following that is \"Narcissus.\" Reminds me a bit of my dad, one of those guys who thinks the world is his \"you return to the center of your universe.\" It's an interesting song but has a limited audience. ****From there \"Hands Clean\" comes on sentimental and gentle.. then suddenly it becomes fast paced and strong. It's an excellent song with an undeniable melody. (Despite the merciless hawk halfway through, \"What part of our history is reinvented and under rug swept\")*****\"Flinch\" is a song that will have a wide audience. One of those matches made in Heaven turned sour. It's rather hard to understand at times (\"you feck me like you are my dad\"- \"feck\" meaning \"affect.\"), but has a strong melody and particularly poignant lyrics. *****\"So Unsexy\" is possibly the star of the album, who hasn't felt \"so unsexy for someone so beautiful, so unloved and for someone so fine... so boring for someone so interesting, so ignorant for someone of sound mind?\" It's a very intimately personal song for most, buy the album for this one! ************\"Precious Illusions\" has an almost Middle Eastern sound at first which becomes a progressive rock beat later in the tune. You know those dreams and illusions you've had for your entire life? Well, in this Alanis refuses to abondon those little thoughts. ***\"That Particular Time\" is the longest drag of the album, I recommend skipping it. *\"A Man\" is a very refreshingly interesting song, it gets repetitive after a while, don't overplay it! I love the background music. *****Possibly my favorite of the album \"You Owe Me Nothing\" tells of an undying friendship and support, \"(and there are no strings attached) You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give/you owe me nothing for caring the way that I did/I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege\" *****\"Surrendering\" drags the album down a little, but is good nonetheless. **\"Utopia\" can get on your nerves after a while, but it's interesting the first few times. A different sound than you might expect. ****This album is not conditional, you must own it!\n", "val": 0.02287106215953827}

{"text": "After a few initial listens of Under Rug Swept, I have to say that it is very enjoyable to listen to, with its good points and its not so good points.  i have been a huge alanis fan for a few years now, but unlike most people, it was Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie which really caught my eye.  Although it was released 4 years ago, it still gets heavy rotation in my CD player.  SFIJ has 17 tracks that can put most other artists to shame.  At the same time however, most people weren't willing to listen to a more spiritual and avant guarde, and less angry alanis, as witnessed in Jagged Little Pill, the album which put her in the record books for most albums sold by a female artist.Anyway, I would say that URS is somewhere in the middle of her two previous studio recordings, but leaning a bit more toward Jagged Little Pill, which will please most audiences, but not those who favored her second album more.  In all, I would say that URS is a very enjoyable listen, but it didn't meet the standards which she set for herself with Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie in relation to artistic risks and the deepness and profoundness of both the music and the lyrics.\"That Particular Time\" is a very heartfelt song, which brings back memories of \"That I Would Be Good\" on the SFIJ album.  \"Hands Clean\" is very catchy and should do very well on the charts, with an interesting twist where the verses in the song are told thru the perspective of a former lover while the chorus is told in her viewpoint.  \"A Man\" is a bold song, with a very catchy melody, told in the viewpoint of, of course, a man (which is part of the reason why I am a fan of hers, her willingness to take risks).  \"Eutopia\" is a very thought provoking song, while \"21 things I want In A Lover\" leans toward the provocative and sophisticated.  My favorite track on the album is \"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\" because it has a very catchy hook and melody, while delivering an almost tongue and cheek message of unconditional love.  It completely grabbed my attention on the first listen.  With that in mind, I will say that the album isn't without some filler.  Their are 2 or 3 tracks on it that were just mediocre, especially when compared to other tracks on the album.In all, URS is an excellent listen, but I guess after such a long wait and high anticipation for this album after the greatness of Junkie, it left a little to be desired.\n", "val": 0.022126413881778717}

Along with her personal development, she grew as an artist as well. Alanis writes and speaks about the thughts and feelings we experience of a life time, but never know how to express them ourselves. For example, in the song \"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\" Alanis talks about love being unconditional and a gift rather than a conquest or object of possession. The line that best describes this is \"This is the only kind of loveas I understand it that there really is.\" Alanis feels comfortable enough now in this stage of her life to relte to her audience how she really feels and what she sees. As for the song \"Narcissus\" I stand behind it 100% Yes I am a man too, but she points out the tragic flaws in men and how its ok for them slide by in our society simply because they are \"men\" and I believe that is not right. Over all this album is a new platform for Alanis persoanlly and professionally.

And sometimes, not exactly the right person...The lyrics describe a love so giving and selfless, that at times it seems that the speaker has lost all sense of self-worth.

{"text": "Before I get started I have to state that I'm one of those die-hard (some may say obsessive) Alanis fans. Everyone has one album that \"changed my life\" so to speak, and Jagged Little Pill is that album for me, which I listened to over and over again nonstop back in 1996. Unlike some people, when Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie came out I was not at all disappointed. I didn't like it as much as JLP, but it's nearly impossible to ever top the album that changed your life. It was a lot more spiritual and poetic than JLP, which made it a different album (and not as radio friendly) but one that was brilliant in its own right. My only real complaint about it was that it does drag on a little in a few songs.Under Rug Swept plays something like the child of JLP and SWIJ. Many of the songs are in the same style as those of JLP, but the spirituality and poetic nature of SWIJ is evident throughout. No matter which album on hers is your favorite, this one will not disappoint. Just sit back and enjoy these 11 brilliant, beautiful and well-sung songs.1. 21 things I want in a lover - The song is pretty much exactly how it sounds, with her crafting a song around 21 things she would like in a lover. Sounds most like an SWIJ song with the guitar rifts and the possible Indian influence (it sounds to me like the qualities she's looking for would be most evident in a Buddhist man). Very cool way to open the album.2. Narcissus - Probably the most JLP-like song on the album, and one of my favorites. It's kind of a return to the woman-scorned/bad relationship songs that made her famous, but it's also pretty funny if you pay attention. It almost plays like a parody of the woman-scorned trend she started. And the vocals are some of her best, reminiscent of Ironic and Unsent.3. Hands Clean - You've probably heard it several times already, but that doesn't lessen it's impact. It's another one of my favorites from the album. I've heard speculation that it's about rape, but I don't see it. It sounds a lot more like about moving on to me.4. Flinch - It took me a few listenings to really get this song, but once I got it, I must say that it is possibly Alanis' best ballad and most beautiful ever, much in the style of Mary Jane. It must be listened to several times to truly be understood.5. So Unsexy - A nice and upbeat sounding song about insecurity, that sounds like it could have fit on either JLP or SFIJ.6. Precious Illusions - Another nice and upbeat song and another one of my favorites. The lyrics are easy to relate to for anyone who's ever dealt with not being where you wanted to be in your life, and finally letting go and accepting reality. I've definitely been there.7. That Particular Time - Another very beautiful ballad, in the style of the previous Flinch. While the former is about getting over a relationship from a decade ago, this one is about getting over one now that you thought would last. Both ballads showcase Alanis' true range.8. A Man - Another favorite of mine, for personal reasons. One of the easiest ways to ... [upset] me ... is to call Alanis a man-basher. She is not! I am a man I have always loved Alanis since the beginning and never found her offensive. The true man-bashers are certain feminists who insist on lumping all men into one mold and blaming us for everything. In this song Alanis sings from the point of view of a man tired of that.9. You Owe Me Nothing in Return - Can't quite explain why I love this song but I just do. It's yet another one of Alanis' unique takes on a relationship.10. Surrendering - Once again, another one of my favorite songs. What other people have criticized about this song is exactly what I love about it. Before I read the Entertainment Weekly review criticizing her for using the lyrics \"I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces that I represent\" my first thought was this was a great lyric. That's what I like about Alanis, she uses whatever best fits the song.11. Utopia - An excellent way to close the album. It's different from her other ballads and ranks as one of her most beautiful songs to date, lyrically and voice wise. During a time of stress (which there plenty of today) just pop this song in for a temporary escape.All in all, a very good album! If I had to pick I would have to say my favorite songs are Narcissus, Hands Clean, Precious Illusions, Surrendering and Utopia. But the entire album works so well that there's no reason to choose favorites. The entire album is worth listening to again and again. If you're one of those who hated SFIJ because it dared to differ from the same radio songs we hear again and again you'll probably find plenty not to like about this one as well, but I can't recommend enough that you give it a chance!\n", "val": 0.025660347193479538}
{"text": "I have always loved great rock n roll sung by great women, like the great Stevie Nicks, Joan Jett, and of course Alanis. \"Under Rug Slept,\" has to be my second favorite Alanis album, because \"Jagged Little Pill\" was a big part of my life, and every song is incredible.I liked \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" alright, but nothing compared to the intensity that was put into Jagged Little Pill, it just couldn't compare.Alanis has matured now, and it shows in her new masterpiece here.The first line of the whole CD is true Alanis \"Do you derive oy when some else succeeds?\"The first single, \"Hands Clean,\" is VERY catchy and great to sing along with and dance, even in your car...The CD also has some more mysterious songs like \"A Man,\" when Alanis sings from a man's point of view, and \"Flinch.\"It's a rock record, but it has some quiet moments too.

She's simply better at making angry songs.  And this CD sounds very happy, and a little more poppy than her other albums.  I don't know if its just me, but all bands seem to be getting more poppy on later releases.  THis includes No Doubt, the Cranberries, and many others... There are few that would even be indecisable enough to get played on the radio, and the first song is the hardest song on the album which is quite disappointing.

( With exceptions for songs such as \"Head Over Feet\" and \"You Learn). We were greeted with Supposed Former Infatutation Junkie, Which brought us such happy ballads as 'So Pure\" and \"Thank You\" This was an incredible change in pace for Alanis, and left many people doubting WHO Alanis really was, and if the entire idea behind JLP was producer(Glen Ballards) work. They figured that the angry chick music that was written in JLP...wasnt really hers. What many people didn't know, was of Alanis's 2 year trip to India. In India..she finally got a rest from her JLP tour, and she spent time getting to know herself. She has a VERY self-actualizing trip..and finally came at peave with herself. She was ready to stop writing completly..but had a change of heart, and set out with a much more peaceful sense of lyricism.With her new display, Under Rug Swept, Alanis demonstrates how versatile she really is. Its JLP and SFIJ all in one..and its truely an amazing album. Highlighted Tracks.\"Precious Illusions\"\"Flinch\"\"So Unsexy\"and of course, the first single \"Hands Clean\" once you understand that shes telling the story from HIS point of view..it all falls into place,and becomes a beautiful song.The only reason I did not rate this one 5  stars, ( as I did with JLP) was the lack of rhythm she displays..Lyrically, its the best shes been at( not to mention vocabulary wise) But some of the songs lack the catchy hooks of JLP\n", "val": 0.018660204485058784}
{"text": "First off, I never quite took to Supposed Former ... so I was wary of this album. Good news - you shouldn't be. It's as personal as ever, but she is clearly a very good producer or at least has great engineers backing her up, because it sounds better than either of the two earlier albums.She knows her strengths but is not formulaic, and doesn't get trapped into the \"hits-by-numbers\" style of production. Let's face it, if it weren't for Alanis, Glen Ballard would be the Mutt Lange of the late 90s - look at the last Dave Mathews and Aerosmith albums!Some reviews have actually castigated her for being so inward looking - would you prefer the Max Martin school of lyrics? One eye on the prepubescent market and the other on the balance sheet? No, Alanis is still as biting as ever, and she's broadened her sonic palette enough to make it really interesting this time. No, she doesn't have Miss E guesting, but there are hooks aplenty, and then you realize she's got them in your flesh and she's pulling. I suppose both Alanis and Fiona Apple owe royalties to Elvis Costello, for inventing the \"lovely-melody-with-acid-lyrics\" template, but it still stands up to scrutiny here.As for ranting about men, \"Hands Clean\" and \"You owe me nothing\" are pretty straightforward un-rants, so I don't think she's monomaniacal. And anyway, she's writing interesting, personal lyrics, with an album-full of good, interesting playing - what else do you want in a world full of N'Sync, Britney, Limp Whatsit and countless other manufactured teen hit machines?She's lived a lot of life for a 28 year old, and would rather sing about what she sees in the world and her life, than put out fake schmaltz about - oh, the world's children, dolphins or the state of the ozone layer, for instance!

A surefire hit if released as a single I think. Everyone knows the opening single \"Hands Clean\", which is a great song to introduce the public to the album with. \"So Unsexy\" is another great song, which rightfully deserves to be a single. Other highlights include the songs \"Surrendering\", \"Utopia\", \"Flinch\", and \"A Man\". This is definately one of her best albums, and worth a listen or two.

Let's face it, Jagged Little Pill was an amzing album, and unlike most people, I felt that Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie was her BEST work, but this new album falls falt on its face.  Alanis sells out her long-time collaborator Glen Ballard, and the edgy Band Memebers, and pulls off what can only be discribed as \"POP.\"  This new album lacks any of the edginess of Jagged or the alternative style of Supposed, and ops for a more radio friendly, let's-please-the-teenagers style of non-music.  The songs are forgettable; with the impulse to press the skip button overwhelming. The songs lack any memorable quality that made Supposed and Jagged such great albums. Having listened to the album five times now; i can honestly say that only a few songs stand out; with so much filler material in the way. It's a shame there's filler when the ambum has only 11 songs.  Narcissus stands out; as well as So Unsexy and Utopia. But the album is full of songs that are interchangeable and forgettable. It lacks the usual Alanis quality.  Who could a thought an artist who realeased such great studio albums could fall this fast. A CD to please the masses is not a CD at all. It's pop. The once edgy, alternative artist has abandoned all sense of style to create this piece...that can only please marketing execs and those who like disgusting pop.  This is nasty.  Sure many people hated Supposed, but to do so proves the music buying public's ignorance. Supposed was excellent, a one-of-its-kind, brushed off by teeny-boppers with no taste and little intelligence. Or does that confuse people?  If people want to keep hearing the same everybody-has-this-song-so-I-must-have-it-to style of music then buy this album and dismiss Supposed with that small mass you call a mind.  But if you want edgy, honest music, skip this album and go for Supposed and jagged for a taste of REAL talent.\n", "val": 3.222107625333592e-05}

Her newest release falls somewhere in between her two previous albums, her first dealing with feelings towards other people and her second searching for something beyond herself it seemed to me. This one seems like she has found something of what she was searching for and dealt with some of those emotions. Now she seems to be looking inside herself to find out where she truly lands on her own personal journey. It gives you some of the remaining anger of the first album yet still has some of the spirituality of the second. A fantastic combination.

The song is about Alanis' relationship with a narcissistic self obsessed lover...The chorus \"Why why do I try to love you, try to love you when you really don't want me to\" is her way of showing that as humans, we are almost naturally drawn to these types of peopleTrack 3- Hands Clean  First single off the cd, beautiful, catchy...About alanis having a relationship with a much older man several years agoTrack 4-  Flinch, one of the ballads on the album, easy to relate to...About an exboyfriend from almost a decade ago, that still holds some control of alanis...They've been broken up for quite some time, but now he lives in her city, and shes afraid of running into him...alanis hopes that \"soon Ill grow up and I won't even flinch at your name\"Track 5-  So Unsexy  This should be a single..its got a bouncy funky groove to it, and alanis makes lyrics like \"I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful, so unloved for someone so fine\" sound like an anthem...a great song for anyone whos ever felt insecureTrack 6-  Precious Illusions  Another solid single..It almost sounds middle eastern, but then a drum beat and some awesome guitars kick in...About beliefs alanis had as a child, that someone or something could complete her...and her learning to let go of such \"precious illusions\" and find peace within herselfTrack 7-  That Particular Time  An amazing ballad that tells the story of a stalled relationship, and how even though you love someone and want to make a relationship works, sometimes the best thing to do, is leaveTrack 8-  A Man  This song probably confuses some people..Its alanis singing from the perspective, of well, a man!  Alanis has a reputation for bashing men in her songs, and this is her compliment to the few good men left out there..The man in the story is a genuinely good person and deserves respect..This song is musically very strong, due to its rock vibes, and powerful bassTrack 9-  You Owe Me Nothing In Return  This song has almost a sarcastic feel to it...Its basically Alanis talking to a boyfriend and saying that she will love him no matter what, and that she doesn't expect anything in return...her love is unconditional...It has a beautiful piano in it, and a good pop beatTrack 10-  Surrendering  This song has been criticized because of its chorus (which contains the lyric \"And I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces that I represent\") many people feel its lyrics are too psych 101-ish..but its just a sophisticated pop song...It has an awesome rolling beat that is almost reminiscent of Madonnas \"Dont Tell Me\" Its almost like Alanis' take on two steppingTrack 11-  Utopia  Lyrically, another one of the albums strongest points..It was wisely put as the closing track...Its Alanis idea of what a perfect world would be...The layered vocals aren't really working for me, but look past that and listen to the beautiful lyrics...Its a very calm soothing song musicallyHmm, Well thats about it...I think Under Rug Swept should further discount the belief that Jagged Little Pill was a fluke..Alanis has a lot left to say, and this album is probably going to be one of the best (if not the best) albums of the year...Musically and lyrically and vocally strong throughout...Under Rug Swept is a huge step in the right direction for alanis\n", "val": 0.024936029687523842}

There are a few duds (\"A Man\" is awful and \"Flinch\" isn't much better), but there are also some really great tracks (the ones that stand out are \"Narcissus,\" \"Hands Clean,\" and \"Utopia\").One thing that really bugs me is when she is singing along with the beat of the song (i.e. Narcissus) and then breaks out of the beat because there are too many words.  Come on, it's not that difficult to either change/omit a word or slow the beat a little!

I think a lot of people were put off by the stream-of-consiousness-poetry-set-to-music aspect of the album, but that is what I liked about it.  Under Rug Swept seems to take a step back towards the sound of Jagged Little Pill.  The songs are a bit more focused, pop oriented, and less experimental.  \"Hands Clean\" is the first single and was very catchy, but has become tiresome after multiple listenings.  The standout songs in my opinion are \"That Particular Time\", \"Narcissus\", \"Flinch\", \"Precious Illusions\", and \"So Unsexy\".My only complaint of the album is the focus.  \"A Man\" and \"Utopia\" seem very out of place on the album.  Both are good songs, but would have fit better on the Junkie album.  The religious rant and idealism don't really mesh with the other, more personal topics.Regardless, I think the album is very good and has been in havy rotation ever since I got it.

I liked her as a peppy teen on Star Search, I was both enthralled and disgusted by her nekkid suit video, and I wanted to be in the car with her (maybe she'd let me borrow that cool hat she was wearing) in that dopey video for that song from the similarly caustic \"Jagged Little Pill\".  Well, this album's not all that much different than the last two.Sure, she's done the writing her self.  But...is that such a good thing?  Her tunes are tuneful and the playing is top-notch and very catchy.  But it's the lyrics Heavy Hop Dop can't get behind.  It's the same old woe-is-me, mopey, men are bad-I am sad kinda garbage she's been spitting out for the past five years.  And I've had enough.

A must own for any \"pill\" popper or \"infatuation junkie\"\n", "val": 0.010411680676043034}
{"text": "It's not just a part to the chorus of a song, but also a motto for many Alanis fans when they think of the years between Jagged Little Pill and Under Rug Swept.  Not to discount the wonderful work that was put into \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" and \"MTV Unplugged\" (both albums that have a special place in my collection), it's just that the songs were presented in a more sedate, less emotionally potent way than on JLP.  I welcome the come back, and hope that she enjoys at least half the success that was garnered \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\"Under Rug Swept\" opens with a scratchy hip-hop beat in the song \"21 Things I want in a Lover,\" where she ticks off a list of \"not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer.\"  Highly intellectual and daring (\"are you uninhibited in bed, more than three times a week, up for being experimental\"), this song is a great way to kick this album off.A few songs later, we hear \"Hands Clean,\" the current single (and the latest one she's released since 1999).  While many consider this song to almost be an extension of \"You Oughta Know,\" more seasoned fans I believe, will relate it more to \"Right Through You\" from Jagged Little Pill.  That's just my thought, anyway... and I'm getting off track.The rest of the record is filled with anthems for anyone who's ever been on the lower self-esteem end of a relationship (\"So Unsexy\") to anyone who's ever been in a relationship that's ended and is still deeply affected by that person (\"Flinch\").  \"Utopia\" gives us a little bit of philosophical ranting on what a perfect world would be for Ms. Morissette, (it was released on the Internet Post Sept. 11th) and it's a beautifully light song where her voice is able to soar.Hands down, this is the best of her last three releases, and for those of you who miss the slightly bitter rawness of Jagged Little Pill, check this CD out.  And, for those of you who loved Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, there's still the same deepness to this record, with a little bit harder melody.\n", "val": 0.023567920550704002}
{"text": "After hearing the terrific songs \"So Unsexy\" and \"Hands Clean\" on the radio, I rushed out and bought what I hoped would be a smart, energetic, insightful CD. What I discovered instead was Alanis Morrissette basically recycling the same music she used on her \"Jagged Little Pill\" CD. Only this time, her lyrics are more obtuse, less accessible, and less compelling. There are a few bright spots on the CD, such as the songs I mentioned. But, overall, the CD is rather negligible and self-involved. I believe only die-hard fans of Morrissette's will get any real mileage out of this vapid collection. (Ironically enough, I purchased Lisa Loeb's new CD \"Cake & Pie\" the same day I bought this one, and that CD surprised me by being the musically superior to Morrissette's effort.

{"text": "Former Alanis fans who lashed out in disgust at \"Former Infatuation Junkie\" listen up, it's time to hop back on the Morissette BANDwagon because Alanis is back with a new album that will take you back to 1995's \"Jagged Little Pill\".  First let me clarify that this is not a clone of \"PILL\" but it's well crafted lyrics and broad variety of CATCHY music styles are reminiscent of her record breaking first album. \"Under Rug Swept\" will delight the music lover in general and long time fans will NOT be disappointed.  * 21 THINGS I WANT IN A LOVER- The album opens with the raunching chords of a guitar followed by Alanis's advertisement to the world for her soul mate.  Very catchy and one of my favorites!  * NARCISSUS- This song took me a few listens for me to enjoy but now I wouldn't dare skip over it! If you don't care for it the first time, try a few more listens, you may learn to appreciate it.  *HANDS CLEAN- By now you have probably heard this song and have already judged it so I will just say it is a fantastic song BUT there are other songs on the album that are as good or even better.  *FLINCH- Great slow song somewhat reminiscent of \"MARY JANE\" on \"Pill\"  *SO UNSEXY- Another of my favorites!  The lyrics are brilliant and accompanied by a bouncy tune that I think has a similar feeling of \"You Learn\". (SHOULD BE HER NEXT SINGLE)  *PRECIOUS ILLUSIONS- GREAT SONG!! Very upbeat! Thoroughly enjoyable! One of the best!  *That Particular Time- Beautiful baled that brings out the best in Alanis's \"softer\" singing voice. If you like Sarah McLachlan's \"Angel\" you will enjoy this song. Beautiful!!  *A MAN- Alanis returns with her raw voice and heavy guitars in this one! The sound reminds me a little of \"Sympathetic Character\" but MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER! Really a great song.  *YOU OWE ME NOTHEING IN RETURN- My personal favorite. I LOVE the lyrics on this one (please read them, they are brilliant)and the beat sticks in your head. Only Alanis could have ever written this song!  *SURRENDERING- UPLIFTING SONG AND LYRICS!  GREAT way to get ready to end the album.  Another Favorite!  *UTOPIA- Alanis ends her album with a strumming,soaring Celtic feel and lyrics that express her dreams of a PERFECT world. Great close for this album. This album comes highly recommended and is truly a piece of musical and lyrical art! Don't hesitiate.....see ya at the record store and Alanis...........see you at the Grammys!!\n", "val": 0.024623261764645576}
{"text": "Alanis Morissette is back with her third worldwide release, Under Rug Swept.  It has a different feel to it than her previous albums, Jagged Little Pill and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.  However, she utilizes the skills only she possesses to create a unique and remarkable album.  She combines all that she has learned from her previous albums in collectively creating this album.The album starts out with a BANG on \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\".  An awesome and rocky start to the album is provided with the strumming of the guitars.  This song is sure to be a HUGE hit.  \"Narcissus\" brings us back to the \"You Oughta Know\" days, but it is lyrically more humourous than its predecessor.  The ending of this song is just AWESOME.... \"Hands Clean\", the first single... there are no words... it is a good introduction to the world about Alanis' \"style\" on URS.  \"Flinch\" demonstrates Alanis' more emotional side with relationships.  It is a mellow tale of a relationship gone-wrong.  \"So Unsexy\" tells about her insecurities, and that she should realize that she is a unique and awesome person.  Like ALL her songs, she wishes her listeners to realize the same thing about themselves.  Song 6, \"Precious Illusions\" is one of the (many) highlights of the album.  The beat, the lyrics, the entire song are simply perfect.  \"That Particular Time\" will blow a lot of people away.  This song may turn some fans off, and it may also bring some \"non-fans\" in.  It is a DIFFERENT type of Alanis song.  It is an emotional and heartfelt tale of a relationship that ended.  Her expression and emotion in the song are indescribable.  You can almost hear her crying.  \"A Man\" is, along with \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\", THE rock song on the album.  Alanis is less \"rocky\" on this album, but in these two songs, she shows she has yet to lose that part of her.  \"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\" is another mellow song about her past relationships.  The best part of this song is her lyrics!  \"Surrendering\" is another one of those surprise songs on this album.  It takes us to a new place, and a new sound.  It is amazing, as all the other songs are, and her talent is truly exemplified in it.  The final song of this album \"Utopia\", was released on the Internet in the wake of the tragedies of September 11.  Although she wrote it before that date, it is a profound and powerful song that expresses her views of a world in which everyone would \"respond and expand and include and allow and forgive and enjoy and evolve and discern and inquire and accept and admit and divulge and open and reach out and speak up\".  There would be peace in the world, and everything would be done \"sans jugement\" (without judgment).  If not a perfect song, this is simply an amazing expression of one's thoughts; it is a genuine poem.To some, this review may seem to be one made by a CRAZEE and OBSESSED fan of Alanis Morissette, and for the most part, it is!!!  However, with all the \"unbiasedness\" possible, this is truly an inspirational and remarkable album!  It is possibly superior to the album that MADE Alanis Morissette (JLP).  However, YOU be the judge.  Give her another shot!!!\n", "val": 0.028906065970659256}

{"text": "2002 is early but alanis morissette's third studio album \"under rug swept\" is easily one of the yrs best.  Words can't explain my love for this woman and her marvelous album.  In many ways, under rug swept is superior to any of her past endeavours, including her American rock debut jagged little pill.  She manages to bring a solid, fresh album and does not linger too long in her failed relationships.  She talks about hope and defends the opposite sex in the hip=hop inspired \"a man.\"  The album opens with the explosive \"21 things...\"  Destined to be compared to \"you oughta know.\"  The momentum continues with \"narcissus.\"  She's well aware of her vocal range and uses them better here than in any past productions.  \"hands clean\" is a personal favorite of mine.  Not to forget, perhaps her best video to date.  \"flinch\" touches ballad territory but never succumbs to shameless mush.  \"so unsexy\" is bound to be 2002's anthem.  \"precious illusions\" can be easily labeled \"hands clean part 2.\"  Nonetheless, it's another alanis gem.  She goes \"sinead o'conner\" in \"that particular time.\"  Who knew she could sound so angelic.  That's followed by the edgy \"a man.\"  The last excellent track happens to be 'surrendering.\"  Overall, the album will be destined to be a strong grammy contender as jagged pill was no mre than 6 yrs ago...Forget about her contemporaries, this is the clearly one of the must have albums of 2002.  everything here is authentic, genuine, just clean!.

It starts off good with \"21 Things I Want In A Lover\", and gets better as the album goes on.  The first single release \"Hands Clean\" sounds better on the CD, I'll be it a little slower, but it's what you would expect from Alanis great music.  Some other songs stand out in my mind, they are the albums 9th track \"That Particular Time\" and the 11th and last track \"Utopia\"(a song I heard before the album was released).  This is a good album and it is so good to have Alanis back, I hope the general public welcomes her back with open arms, because the music industry needs artist like Alanis, this was worth all the wait.  Jewel came back, now Alanis and next hopefully Sheryl Crow.  But back to the album, it stands up very well against her first two releases.  If I were Alanis and looking to release the next song I would go for \"That Particular Time\", this song is very mellow and Alanis' voice sound great.  \"Under Swept Rug\" recieves an A(for Alanis).

{"text": "I am by no means a fan of Alanis Morissette. Her voice sometimes annoys me. Lyrically her songs comes off a bit contrived and lacking any bite or edge that artists such as Ani Difranco and Tori Amos consistently churn out with each album. What compelled me to buy \"Under Rug Swept\" was not the single \"Hands Clean\" but rather the plaintive acoustic ballad \"Utopia\". I just fell in love with the song. When I heard \"Surrendering\" on MTV2 over the past weekend, my curiousity was piqued even more. I decided right then and there that I would have to buy \"Under Rug Swept\" regardless of my thoughts on Alanis as an artist. Now that I have heard the entire album. The good news is that I can't say that I regret buying the cd because there are some excellent songs. The bad news is that the first two songs are just hideous for me to listen to. I just hate Alanis' screeching vocals on \"Narcissus\", and \"21 Things I Want In a Lover\" just came off sounding stupid lyrically. I have to skip those two tracks. \"Hands Clean\" isn't too bad. It is starting to grow on me but it certainly isn't one of my favorite tracks on this album. The material starts getting stronger and better right after \"Hands Clean\" I think, particularly starting with \"So Sexy\". The lyrics were a bit off-putting for me and came off somewhat cheesy but the melodies and the musicianship were great. \"Precious Illusions\" is another favorite track of mine. This time the lyrics were good as were the hooks and melodies. I think Alanis sounds much better when she isn't singing off the top of her lungs and rather low-key (for her that is) like in songs such as \"That Particular Time\" and \"Utopia\". Those were my favorite moments. Unlike Natalie Imbruglia's \"White Lilies Island\", I still remain unconvinced regarding Alanis Morisette's talents. This album was so spotty in various places I still remained convinced that she is just a mediocre artist but it doesn't mean that I think she is terrible, just mediocre at best. Nevertheless she has gotten off on the right foot with this album for me. I just hope that she can do better material than \"21 Things I Want in a Lover\" and \"Narcissus\".\n", "val": 6.84443220961839e-05}

She seems more serene, yet still troubled. Thank God for that. I she went all \"ooh baby\" Britney Spearish, I'd have to switch to N'Sync. She is not \"angry\" anymore as she seemed on Jagged Little Pill. As a whole, Under Rug Swept is a beautiful album with heart-stabbing moments (Flinch, That Particular Time).

{"text": "Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Moriessette's first album, Jagged Little Pill, firmly pegged her as a kind of man-hating, nappy-haired berfeminist.  Although 1998's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie intended to break that trend, it ended up cementing the stereotype and added Alanis' second dimension, that of the girl who keeps going out with the guys who are jerks just because she can't help herself.  If ever pop culture has produced a more sickening excuse to continue bad behavior, it has yet to rear its head in the musical scene.That being said, Alanis, whose attempts to revitalize an acting career in Kevin Smith's Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (yes, she had a cameo at the end), returns with Under Rug Swept, another effort to break out of her mold.  Unfortunately, she ends up right where she left off, and while musically that's a good thing, lyrically, it's lackluster at best.Alanis mixes up some beats on the opening track, \"21 Things I Want In A Lover,\" but returns to her angry-guitar comfort zone on the rest of the CD, which is more than acceptable, as it's her best gig.  The lyrics on these tunes (watch out for the pretentious coffee-house poem \"Narcissus\") are more of her typical aimless wanderings, jumbling words that don't go together into semi-coherent thoughts.  In other words, she doesn't do much to help herself out of her stereotype.  Again, that's not necessarily a bad thing, since it seems to pay the bills, but as an artist, it does as much to prevent people taking her seriously as her turn on \"You Can't Do That On Television\" did to prevent movie producers from taking her seriously.  It's something she's trying her best to get away from, and both are ghosts that will continue to haunt her until she does a little growing up.All in all, though, the songs on Under Rug Swept (yes, the title is an innuendo) serve their purpose, but perhaps the purpose could change a little on the next effort.\n", "val": 0.0003056805580854416}

{"text": "'The Changeling' was an underrated movie about a pianist & composer (the late George C. Scott) who moves into a house that is haunted by the ghost of a young boy murdered years earlier by his father, after Scott's wife & daughter are killed in a traffic accident. The film itself is a classic ghost story with some chilling twists; the music not only augments the film but is essential to telling the story. This release includes the film's complete score, along with some alternate/unused cues previously unreleased, and presented in chronological order (a fact often appreciated by soundtrack buffs).While some elements of the score contain classic piano - the incidental music played by Scott near the film's beginning is included - a lot of it relies heavily on violin/cello/viola cues to create a sense of dread/apprehension, particularly as Scott's character begins to realize he is not the only occupant of the mansion. It also relies heavily on dramatic bursts of woodwinds, percussion & brass as the supernatural force becomes a terrifying menace to Scott.Fans of this underrated haunted-house classic will want to get this score; until recently it seemed difficult to come by unless you were will to fork over a lot for it. Get this one before it disappears!\n", "val": 0.00583387166261673}
{"text": "The score to The Changeling is remarkable in that it is both beautiful and haunting. It could easily pass for a classical piece, with heavy use of piano and strings. Many times, film scores are passed over, but this one should never be. It is rare in it's ability to immerse the listener in it's dark, eerie melody regardless if they have seen the film. It can tell a story on it's own. Put this in the stereo, turn off the lights, lie down, and prepare to be both enchanted and frightened out of your wits. You WILL leave the lights on afterward! Pity this score was only released by the now defunct Percepto Records, who released rare and desired film scores in absurdly limited amounts. This resulted in the cds being sold out within minutes, never having the chance to see a retail shelf or to be bought by someone who had no previous knowledge of it's release.

The 100th listen is as good as the first.  There are no accidental distractions such as aircraft, vehicles or other man-made annoyances. Everything sounds like an expert recordist with high quality equipment went out and recorded real live nature in an uninterrupted session, and produced it without repetition or any noticeable edits.

He did do a wonderful job eliminatING those awful obnoxious noises so...I guess that much is absolutely perfect. But I really do prefer deeper wave sounds. Could you please ask the creator of this cd,...if he has a ocean sound cd that has deeper sounding waves? I would really appreciate it.

May I suggest also these by Joe Baker for your listening enjoyment:1) Thunderstorm By the Sea--this sounds like a gentle thunderstorm while at sea so it is very soothing and relaxing to listen to and it is 73 minutes.2) Ultra Pure White Noise--this is the very calming white noise and very gentle, the soft and relaxing kind. And I must say the best quality of white noise that I have heard and it is 73 minutes.3) Wind and Rain - This is a soothing and gentle wind and rain. Easy to listen to and so so relaxing! IT is 73 minutes.4) Ocean Waves and Wind - This is 74 minutes of pure relaxation!5) Thundering Rainstorm - This is about 73 minutes.6) Babbling Brook - This is my very favorite one. Sounds just like you are sitting next to a babbling brook. I close my eyes and relax and can almost feel the water next to me. This is that realistic. And it is 73 minutes.I think that I own about 3 more but can't think of them now.

It is great for ambient noise. But, I grew up camping on the beach. Chasing sand crabs and fishing and diving. The sound of the ocean is much more rich and alive than this could capture for me.But, please don't take this to mean it's not a worthwhile addition. Quite the contrary. It's a wonderful track. I'm probably just behaving like a spoiled kid.My wife has had many spiritual experiences wherein the ocean represents even more to her than it does to me. I still enjoy listening to the track. She says that to her, it doesn't quite cut it.My bottom line, if you grew up in and around the beach, you are going to be more critical of this track because you will have a more vast experiential knowledge base to compare it to.If you just love the ocean, get this track. I am sure you won't regret it.P.S. There are no other sounds on the track but the sound of waves on the shore.

But the thing is that I gave both songs the same rating.I'm not crazy about this song because India is capable of better songs, but it's alright to pass the time by. It won't ever end up on my iPod or anything and if it's on TV, I might get the urge to turn it, but it's not a mindless rap song talking about getting endless amounts of money or getting in some random chicks pants all over again.And India still has her dignity in this video, not really trying to be extra sexy or anything. But this song doesn't really move me much.I prefer 'Brown Skin', 'Little Things' or even the fantastic 'Good Mourning'.That's all I have to say.3.25 stars.\n", "val": 0.0001702283916529268}
{"text": "Jefferson Airplane Takes Off is a most fascinating listen. The style of the music is unique. It is impossible to classify as 1960s pop, for there is too much electric guitar in spite of the harmonizing vocals that would seem to nicely accompany works issued forth by the Australian group, The Seekers. At the same token, it is hard to classify as rock and roll; in comparison to many works of that genre, the atmosphere created is more laid back but the instrumentations are arguably more complex.Since Jefferson Airplane's beginnings rooted in California, one might quickly label the sounds of the band as somewhere between those of two highly famous groups from the same state, namely The Beach Boys and The Doors, with the first at the pop end of the spectrum and the latter at the hard rock range. To do so, I believe, would be missing the point and thus do the band a disservice. Jefferson Airplane was neither pop nor rock and roll but experimental. The sounds they created were distinct and original and did not seem to rely upon going \"cross-genre\" in a musical sense.It can be asserted that many other groups with virtually the same instruments as those used by Jefferson Airplane, including guitar, drums, and tambourine, were boxed in as talented artists who were pressured by record companies to duplicate what was originated just a few years earlier. In the case of Jefferson Airplane, the members thought outside the box, pun intended, and helped to form a new wave of music that would be regarded as counterculture, progressive rock.All in all, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off serves as a valuable testament to the imaginative forces that were starting to collaborate and thus intertwine in San Francisco during the 1960s. Those particular elements sown, especially in this album, would soon come to flourish throughout the world. Jefferson Airplane did indeed take off!\n", "val": 0.009513634257018566}

The operatic singing of Marty Balin; the psychedelic fingerpicking of Jorma; the melodic bass of Jack Cassidy; the rhythm guitar, vocals and songwriting chops of Paul Kantner, the thumping of Spencer Dryden; and the blues belting of Signe Anderson combine to create the sound of the Airplane.

All these years later I can still remember much of this album-- commercials by Ricky and the Balloons for \"Mouth Jive\" (spread it on and watch your body come alive!), and a routine called \"The Gospel Hour,\" featuring a really nifty song called \"What Key Does The Good Lord SIng In?\"  As I recall, Warren Leming was a former member of Second City, so the satire made sense, but I don't think the record company and the public knew what to make of the band.  This was their high point.  It's very much worthy of a listen when located-- I'm going to dig out my copy and spin it soon, and not just for reasons of nostalgia...\n", "val": 0.010496202856302261}

{"text": "I agree with the first reviewer - the performance of the piece is pretty good. Unfortunately, the recording itself is not of great quality. I probably should have been able to tell from the preview, but it is from the very soft opening measures and I thought, \"oh, London Phil, released 2009, must be fine.\"It sounds like it's a very old recording, updated to digital format. I don't feel anything coming from my bass speaker, and I'm pretty sure it's a mono recording. It sounds very flat (in a stereo sense, not a pitch sense).So, if you're just doing score study or something, this one's fine, but if you're looking to blast it in the house or just appreciate high-quality recordings you'll be disappointed.\n", "val": 4.821629045181908e-05}

{"text": "I bought this album after buying their second album (\"The Cold Still\") and hearing a couple of the songs off of this first album, especially since they were offered as bonus tracks in the form of live or acoustic versions.The first 3 tracks are especially good, each of which has their own driving sound. The songs are all catchy yet have a quality that also lends them to being effective music to have on in the background while doing other things. In my review of their second album, I compared them to Beach House and in an odd way to Fleet Foxes. I don't think that their sound changed much between albums, but I'd say that this first album is not quite as consistent as their follow-up effort.The standout tracks include opener \"Flashing Red Lights...\" with its nice falsetto chorus of \"tell me why you're leaving us\"), second track \"Move On\" with its rockin' outro, and finale \"Broken Glass\". \"Misplaced\", is a longwinded pace-changer in the middle of the album that really may be misplaced. It's not awful, but at nearly 6 minutes in length, its a tough rest stop in the middle of an otherwise well-paced album. The album doesn't quite recover from the stronger first half, although it finishes with a high note on the wonderful \"Broken Glass\". Overall, it's a decent album that I am glad that I bought although I'd probably still steer new fans towards \"The Cold Still\" first.\n", "val": 0.005450273398309946}

I bought this cd solely on the strength of a cut I heard from Zombies called Here (in your arms).  This EP is thoroughly listenable. The singer's voice is sweet.  The lyrics are clean and simplistic.  In fact, sophormorically simplistic.  I bought their DVD which by the way includes a fantastic set they did at the House of Blues.  Both versions of Bonnie Taylor Shakedown are worth having though the 2K4 version is a more danceable version and very peppy.  Dear Jamie is saccharin-ly sweet.  In fact, most of the lyrics are pretty saccharin.  I thought this was a joke, a put-on, a wink to the audience.  But after watching the DVD and seeing these boys, this is a not a joke.  They seem like sweet kids, kind of innocent, good friends, and they just want to have some fun and make some fun music to go along with it.  That being said, I am more of an emo, screamo, alternative rock kind of person but I am also a product of the 80's too.  This is more of an retro throwback sound.  If you like that sort of thing, then I highly recommend it.  If you don't and you prefer the emo thing, stay away.  This will not be your cup of tea.

{"text": "Alot of the reviews on this album are based areound compairing Hellogoodbye to Reggie and the Full Effect. Being a fan of Reggie and the Get Up Kids, for years, i can see how someone would compair this to reggie but only for one reason: the fact that its like Comedy Synth Pop. Both bands make joke songs using synthesizers and keyboards and such, but he fact that Reggie has been around longer, people want to lable hellogoodbye as followers, even though the music its self is not that similar. if people want call this a copy of RATFE, then you might as well go and call every Victory Records Band, and every other band that has screamng in it, a copy of whom ever it was that the defined the sound first. In some cases yes, bands do sound the same and one seems to be coping the other, but in this case, i don't think thats the issue. with that asside, i think this is a great and fun album and im excited to hear whats next from these guys!\n", "val": 0.004088361747562885}

Also, jessie buy nothing go to prom anyway isn't really a song, it's just the lead singer shouting in a german accent. So in reality, there are only 4 songs, 4 really awesome songs. Call n' return is one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard, and it'll stay stuck in your head forever. bonnie 2k4 is really good too. I hope they leave the \"joke\" tracks off of the full-length, as they bring down the record as a whole. I look forward to hearing more from this band it the future.

{"text": "I cannot beleive someone actually labeled this band \"original.\" Are you kidding me dude? This Ep is a obvious attempt to duplicate the synth pop, almost comical sound of bands like Reggie and the Full Effect. It ends up being a failed attempt with poor vocals and lacking creativity. Reggie has been around for years, since James Dewees(The Get Up Kids) created the side project that exploded with an underground cult-like fanbase. Hellogoodbye should be ashamed of attempting to make it big by copying the style, humor, and ORIGINALITY of a great band.\n", "val": 1.9732297005248256e-05}

{"text": "I Don't know where I heard about these guys.  Maybe it was here on Amazon.  I can't remember.  Well, that's not the point.  The bottom line is:  This CD is one of the best powerpop/techno/indie/emo EPs I have ever heard.  Yeah, that's a mouth full but that's how I would categorize this.  It's that varied.  Every song on here is catchy as hell.  Given there's only 6 songs, but every one is golden in it's on way.  I seriously don't know why this band isn't all over airwaves.  Perhaps it's due to all the different styles they incorporate.  However, I think that when it comes down to it, they are pop.  I showed this CD to some of my friends at school who usually stick to mainstream stuff.  (fallout boy, green day)  At first they were very skeptical, because most of my music falls under the \"screamo/hardcore\" radar.  However, after hearing \"Dear Jamie\"  They fell in love with it and demanded copies.  After a couple weeks half the school had fell in love with this band.  BTW that was back when they were ENTIRELY indie status.  Now they are a bit more popular.  I don't know why I like this CD so much.  It might be the sound effects, the lyrics, the guy's voice, or the guitarwork.  It's all just so well done.  I can see anybody liking this.  The addictiveness is amazing.The songs seem so similiar, but yet they are very different.  I simply can't express the diversity Hellogoodbye offers.  There aren't many bands that can claim a sound like this.  Sure, there are similiar acts, such as Plain White T's, or Zolof, but even those bands don't sound like this.Lyrically I was greatly impressed.  Usually in this field of music you won't find stuff this deep.  It's almost Emoish.  The subject material pretty much sticks with girls.  (go figure)  Still though, there's a lot of poetic prowess.  Good job Hellogoodbye.SO overall, you need this if you enjot music.  It shall satisfy.\n", "val": 0.024342747405171394}

His opening track, \"Peaceful Soak,\" wraps you in beautifully written melodies very reminiscent of Billy Joel's latest work. \"Ascending & Descending\" is a bit darker than the rest of the album, but gives us something to listen to on one of those off days when we are all a little frustrated and need that one song that describes our day. Mills was also creative in the song names he chose as they very much reflect the ambiance of this album: \"Glorious Horizon,\" \"Fly,\" \"Fragrant Oil,\" and \"Heaven's Delight.\" Whether you just want to relax or hear some magnificent piano playing that soothes your body and soul, then \"SpiritSpa\" is for you.

{"text": "Cher is the comeback queen, and this album was the first in a series of three that Cher released in the late 1980's and early 1990's, marking yet another re-surgance in popularity.  This album is a good indication of why.  Cher also seems to be a chameleon, catering to the music of the times.  During the time of the hair-bands, Cher inlisted the help of songwriters  such as Dianne Warren, Michael Bolton, and Desmond Child, as well as  producers Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, Peter Asher, and Jon Lind to  release this deeply emotional album of songs that are now classics.  The  highlights include the hits \"We All Sleep Alone,\" \"I Found  Someone,\" and \"Perfection,\" as well as the songs \"Give  Our Love A Fightin' Chance,\" and the heartbreaking \"Hard Enough  Gettin' Over You.\"  Why the latter was never released to radio I will  never understand.  The song is well-writen and superbly delivered.  This  album is worth your money.  There are a couple of exceptions on this album  though.  They are \"Main Man\" and \"Working Girl,\" the  songs just aren't that great and should never have been recorded.

Some will  love it for the hit \" I Found Someone\", penned by Michael Bolton,  origional version by Laura Branigan. Cher cut the hit though. Not a bad  listen but Cher can be better.

This one's still a great product of the late 80s.I Found Someone: One of Cher's biggest and best hits.

Another track with Bon Jovi, too.Main Man: Another great ballad that should've been a hit. One of Cher's best vocal performances.Give Our Love a Fightin' Chance: One I forgot about. Not as good as others, but still worthy, especially the chorus.Perfection: This one would've been a good hit. Another highlight of the album.Dangerous Times: Another really good one. Another powerful chorus, too.Skin Deep: Great 80s dance track that inexplicably wasn't a hit. Possibly the best song on the album.Working Girl: Probably the weakest song on the album, but still good.Hard Enough Getting Over You: Absolutely beautiful.

{"text": "In 1987, Cher was enjoying a successful comeback that had begun in the early '80s with acclaimed roles in films such as Silkwood and Mask.  So, by 1987, Cher, confident in her acting career, decided to set sights on the area which launched her career: music.  She hadn't had a top ten hit since 1979's disco anthem \"Take Me Home\".  Cher's self-titled 1987 album is very much a 1980's album. It's a little dated, but the songwriting and production were so strong, they hold up well.  Songs like \"I Found Someone\", \"We All Sleep Alone\", \"Main Man\", \"Hard Enough Getting Over You\" and a cover of her own \"Bang Bang\" are strong and well-produced.  I would argue that this is a better album than its follow-up, 1989's Heart of Stone, which was even more successful.\n", "val": 0.03451979532837868}

However, she had somewhat alienated herself from the younger record-buying public. She had to show the kids that she could still rock with the best of them.Well, she really showed them with this self-titled album, a collection of hard rocking tunes that exhibits the singer's passionate vocal and distinctive style.She also pays tribute to her past with a hard-hitting remake of \"Bang! Bang!, as well as the dance-flavored \"Skin Deep.\"Of course, the quadruple punch of \"I Found Someone,\" \"We All Sleep Alone,\" \"Working Girl,\" and \"Dangerous Times\" are the album's highlights, but this is an excellent release from a legendary performer.It is also one of the best albums of the 80's and it's sometimes good to \"turn back time\" and reflect on monumental music.\n", "val": 0.03315295651555061}
{"text": "Had Cher named her big selling 1998 Believe album Cher, she would've made a history book or two as she recorded in the 60's and then had a brief dry spell until the early 70's when she released an album called Cher, then after a few hits it all dried up again until this 1987 album entitled Cher. But alas Believe wasn't called Cher and that album as fun and perhaps innovative as it was isn't as good as this one. In fact, after all these years it's quite clear to me that Cher can put out numerous excellant singles but in ways of full albums they aren't very good. However, this album seems to be the exception. Perhaps it's because when it came out I listened to it all the time and so all the songs are good. Of course it could also be that after the success of this album she made her next one that sounded almost identical, just like her follow up to Believe was almost a carbon copy to that album. But hey you can't blame the girl for trying to make a few extra bucks. Anyhoos, onto the 1987 album which opens with what is probably my favorite Cher single ever \"I Found Someone\"; a rockin' pseudo ballad complete with keyboards and the like, this was the song that brought the singing Cher back to light. Written by Michael Bolton and originally recorded by Laura Branigan in 1985, this is to me the best version of the song as Cher rocks it out a tad more than Ms. Branigan did. Then we go onto the Jon Bon Jovi composed \"We All Sleep Alone\" another brilliant singer from the girl and then an amped up and redone version of the Sonny written song \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\" produced by the bon of Jovi in fact, this one rocks harder than the original and I like it. There are a few dudish songs on this 10 song set and \"Main Man\" is probably the song I hate the most. For some reason they even tried to release it as a single, it's just a slowish type of ballad with Cher spewing out some fairly strange lyrics for a woman of her age and umm personally conflicted life, but then we move onto two of my all time favorite songs \"Give Our Love A Fighting Chance\" is perhaps full of cliches and even those rock n roll riffs of the 80's that themselves are cliches but it's catchy and I can't help but love it; then Cher cashes in on some of those celebrity C-lists she is on by getting Bonnie Tyler and Darlene Love to sing a pseudo duet on \"Perfection\" which is so damn catchy it gets me singing everytime. The lyrics seem to fit Cher better than some of these songs as well, \"All my life I've been driven by Perfection/ pushed it to the limit every night and day/ oh, I've been driven by Perfection/ but nothing's perfect if love ain't right\" and the ultimate in lyrics, \"When love is here to stay/and then it's gone today/you've got a list of lovers looking like a resume\" - cracks me up every single time. There's some typical 80's fare in here as well including \"Working Girl\" which sounds like a song that should've been on the soundtrack to the Melanie Griffith movie of the same year, and \"Critical Times\" which is what one would probably call filter before ending the whole thing with the rock ballad \"It's Been Hard Enough Getting Over You\" which ironically, Laura Branigan ended up covering a few years later. So for the casual fan there's a million Cher compilations out there and for the extremist, they would want all the crappy albums Cher's put out over the last hundred years but for the semi-fan I would recommend buying one compilation and this album cause you really need to hear the songs that are the cream of the Cher album.\n", "val": 0.005291096866130829}

It is perfect listening when you are stuck in a traffic jam, or when you need music to propel you to clean your house.  The high energy songs will help turn washing your windows or dishes into a tightly choreographed routine.  Some reviewers refer to it as a comeback album, but for some of us, Cher never went away.

For another five year, Cher focused on her career as an actress, then went back in the studio, and in 1987, released this fantastic effort. Cher said that she was worried about the release of this album, and thought that everyone almost forgotten about \"Cher: the singer\", and just thought of her as \"Cher: the actress\", and her career as an actress was very successful, mind you. This album, however, turned out to be her most successful so far. The album bought her right back into the charts, and fans were lovin' Cher's new work!I FOUND SOMEONEThis is a truly awesome song that should be remembered as one of the best Cher singles ever. The song peaked at #5 in the UK, and was a sensational hit in the US. A brilliant song.WE ALL SLEEP ALONEMy fave Cher single of all-time! This isn't the same version as the one on the BELIEVE album. It's the better original version recorded 11 year before the dance version on BELIEVE. An awesome song, and definately my fave on the album. The single made #14 in the US, and #47 (bluddy hell!) in the UK -- EXTREME DISSAPOINTMENT. Despite not getting the success it deserves, WE ALL SLEEP ALONE is a fan fave!BANG-BANG (MY BABY SHOT ME DOWN)This originally recorded in 1966 Cher classic was re-recorded into a metal/rock version in 1987 especially for this album, but also appears on a few of Cher's hit collections. The original version was good, and reached #3 in the UK; #2 in the US, but this version is 10 times better!MAIN MANTruly awesome ballad. There's nothing else that needs to be said about this song.GIVE OUR LOVE A FIGHTIN' CHANCEThis awesome track shows a more snarling Cher that we never knew was there up to this point - it was quite different to anything Cher had ever done before. It's brilliant, and Cher speaks of how her b/f wants to throw their love away, and she tries to persuade him, in many ways, to give their love another chance.PERFECTIONThis song pretty much describes me: I am a perfectionist and almost everything has to be perfect, so I love it! When Cher sang this on her Extravaganza tour, I actually thought it was the best performance given. The refrain at the beginning is sung by Darlene Love and Bonnie Tyler.DANGEROUS TIMESThis song is good, but not one of my faves. I don't listen to it much.SKIN DEEPAwesome, but only reached #79 on the US charts. This song deserved alot more!WORKING GIRLMy fave unreleased song from this album, it's awesome and really showcases Cher's fantastic vocals.(IT'S BEEN) HARD ENOUGH GETTING OVER YOUThis is one of the best Cher ballads that has ever hit planet earth, it's so brilliant and beautiful. If you have just been dumped by your b/f or g/f, let Cher help you recover speedly by listening to this fantastic song!So overall, Cher (1987) is definately one of the diva's best albums. She had another album entitled Cher from 1966, but if you were to choose between the 2 (they both have completely different songs - this one is not a re-issue!!), I would choose this one.

The lyrical \"In My Life\", the surrealistic \"No. 9 Dream\", and the amazing tour de force of \"A Day In The Life\" has finally established Cher as the musical genius we all knew she was.I especially liked the hidden message at the end of \"We All Sleep Alone\" (listen very closely during fadeout, when she says, \"turn me on deadman\").

{"text": "Although aware of Cher as an actress and someone who'd sung with her then-husband Sonny Bono, it wasn't until I was alerted to a new song by Cher.  Upon hearing it, I discovered she'd covered a Laura Branigan song I'd so adored on her Hold Me album.  The song was of course \"I Found Someone,\" which consisted of Michael Bolton's synth-oriented production, the same way he'd do Jennifer Rush on Passion.  Cher's eponymous 1987 album was a vehicle to her second comeback following a string of movie successes, and is a snapshot of the slick synth/pop music of the 80's, when hard rock and pop consisted of layered synths and power ballads, the genre Bon Jovi succumbed to in Slippery When Wet.As a diehard Branigan fan, I prefer the original, but there is a place for this remake, given the wall of synths production, and Toto's Steve Lukather giving help on guitar and on a solo.  Cher's version scratched the Top Ten compared to Branigan's #90.Jon Bon Jovi and his bandmates give Cher lots of help here, whether it be on instruments or backing vocals, or songwriting.  \"We All Sleep Alone,\" the #14 single, was co-written and featured backing vocals by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and rock producer Desmond Child.  Another backing vocalist here is legendary songwriter Holly Knight, late of Spider and Device.  There is that sage acceptance that sooner or later, we all sleep alone.  The same team contribute on a souped up version of \"Bang Bang,\" which she had done in the 60's with Sonny.  There is an operatic quality to the backing vocals, which is then given a harder-edged sound thanks to Richie Sambora, and a wall of synth sound by Holly Knight and Chuck Kentis.  I heard this version before the original, and in a rare move, find this to be my version.Desmond Child wrote and sang backups on the ballad \"Main Man,\" something Cher has had difficulty hanging onto ironically enough.  No, really, this is actually a great power ballad.  He and Diane Warren also co-wrote \"Give Our Love A Fighting Chance\" and \"Perfection,\" the first a power song that could fit on a Bon Jovi album, Slippery When Wet-era of course.  On the second song, Bonnie Tyler and Darlene Love sing the first two lines and are the featured vocalists joining Cher.  The song's theme of being at perfection at work AND at love reflects Cher's choice in singing it, given her marital track record with Sonny and later Gregg Allman.\"Skin Deep,\" though an upbeat number, managed a #79 showing on the charts.  The Desmond Child-Michael Bolton written \"Working Girl\" is a commentary on the hard work and harassment office women get.  The last track the Bolton-produced and co-written \"Hard Enough Getting Over You\" lists the painful reasons why one is reluctant to allow someone back into their life, be it the hurt from lies and the fear of latent pain becoming manifest.  One of the better non-singles here.Cher's comeback is also a testimony to the 80's synth-oriented music produced by Desmond Child and Michael Bolton-okay, I'll give Bolton credit for his songwriting and production, but not his singing!  Cher would further her comeback on her next album, but alas, how some short some comebacks last.\n", "val": 0.00940075796097517}

She appeared in five films from 1983 to early 1987, and they were: SILKWOOD, MASK, MOONSTRUCK, SUSPECT, & THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK.  In 1987, Cher returned to her original roots: Music. She released her nineteenth album entitled simply, CHER. This album is her second album with this title, the first being released in 1966, with such songs as \"Alfie\", and \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\". This album brought Cher back onto the charts, with three chart-topping singles. This album is beyond amazing and displays Cher's experiements with an excellent combo of Rock & Pop music.I FOUND SOMEONE  The first single from the album. This song was originally recorded by Laura Branigan back in 1986. Laura's version was the more than less popular version, reaching #90 on the charts. But Cher had given us the ultimate definitive version. Even though Laura Branigan had recorded this before Cher, this song, to me, is Cher's song. It's a classic song that only Cher can do.WE ALL SLEEP ALONE  The second single from the album. Another amazing song. This is another song that displays Cher's amazing voice and great 80s image.BANG BANG (MY BABY SHOT ME DOWN) (1987 Version)  The third single from the album. Back in 1966, when Cher had released her second album entitled, THE SONNY SIDE OF CHER, she had recorded this classic tune, which was written by Sonny Bono, himself. The song was released as a single then and was a huge hit, later being covered by Frank Sinatra. Well, just 21 years after recording the original, Cher decided to re-record the song into an 80s Metal version and release it as a single. This is another huge successful song and I love it.MAIN MAN  The fourth & final single from the album. Awesome ballad.GIVE OUR LOVE A FIGHTIN' CHANCE  Everybody would love to Give Their Love A Fightin' Chance. Most men or women are to blind to see that. This song is for anybody who would seem to prefer not to give their partners a fighting chance.PERFECTION  I love this song, because: No. 1) It is definitely an awesome song, and No. 2) It fits me to a tee. I'm a perfectionist and everything has to be of my satisfaction. You'll also notice that the refrain sung in the very beginning is sung by DARLENE LOVE & BONNIE TYLER.DANGEROUS TIMES  The 80s were Dangerous Times, but we need to realize that it is now the year 2005, (2006 or 2007, depending on when you read this review), and it is far much worse than it was in the 80s. Listen to this song and be careful with how you live your lives out there in the real world because it isn't easy.SKIN DEEP  Not bad.WORKING GIRL  Awesome.HARD ENOUGH GETTING OVER  I believe that if you had just broken up with your boyfriend or girlfriend, it will be very hard to get over, depending how much in love you were with that person. So, if there is anyone out there who has dumped or has been dumped by your girlfriend of boyfriend, just remember that it is hard to get over that fact, but the pain does go away. While you are waiting for that pain to disappear, let Cher help you by listening to this amazing song.  This album definitely defines 80s image Cher and it should be owned by every Cher fan. NO EXCUSES! If you don't have a copy already, than you are wasting time. So, get up off your a**es and buy a copy of this incredible album from Cher.\n", "val": 0.01577592082321644}

Its power  chords meets a light AC feel for the most part on the album  \"Cher\".It begins with three big hit pieces.  First is her big  comeback hit in \"I Found Someone\".  It's edgy with a lot of  force.  She battles her way to find new love with smoky vocals on top of  guitar rock sounds.  \"We All Sleep Alone\" is a smart power ballad  with Bon Jovi's style as they craft this work with a combo of rock sounds  and biting lyrics like \"You may have lovers wherever you roam, but  sooner or later, we all sleep alone.\"  It's meaningful in a world that  has too many people desperate for love.  \"Bang Bang\" is a semi  interesting rock take on the original, which was kind of an odd folk rock  number.Then the album just goes into another area all together.  You  get Cher combining her voice with the womanly anthem of  \"Perfection\" with Darlene Love and Bonnie Tyler.  It's pop  perfect indeed with a slight rock edge.  You also get really hard numbers  like \"Dangerous Times\" and \"Give Our Love...\" not to  mention pristine ballads like the lovely \"Hard Enough Getting Over  You\" and the solid lyric work of \"Main Man\".  Cher strikes  an even more rebellious song for the working gals with the pop rock  of...well, \"Working Girl\".The real winner is a dance track out  of the realms of Madonna's club scene.  \"Skin Deep\" is an  outrageous blend of bass, drum and keyboard that resembles eighties pop  fever.  It doesn't really fit on this Cher rock album, but its an  unexpected joy and separates from the near sad tones of love, loss and  fighting for independence in the other songs.  It's just kooky dance that  is simpler yet more magical then her sexual disco records.In all, a  great short set of Cher songs, but not her most famous of even the  eighties.  That would be the full on AC rock of \"Heart Of Stone\",  but \"Cher\" with it's new ideals on even old music is trend  setting.  The sad fact is though, many credit Cher's huge name in motion  pictures for making this set a hit, while others just the unbeatable rock  sound of the time.  I would hope that fans will check this one out for  something different and really appreciate the woman for trying new things  and making them work.\n", "val": 0.012429330497980118}
{"text": "My favoutite albums by Cher are her Geffen-albums, made between 1987 and 1992. It's this one, \"Heart Of Stone\" and \"Love Hurts\" (and the \"Greatest Hits 1956-1992\", containing three new songs).  If you like any of the songs you've heard from these albums, you should buy  all of them, because they are great. They sound quite the same, but are  still, by some reason, very different. Diane Warren, Desmond, Child, Jon  Bon Jovi and Michael Bolton have written many of the songs on these albums  and they are great songwriters.  Buy this album, you'll love it! I like the  guita solos (some of them by Steve Lukather (Toto) or Richie Sambora (Bon  Jovi)).\n", "val": 0.03870744630694389}
{"text": "After a string of albums that unfairly were overlooked by the mainstream (albums like Stars, Black Rose and I Paralyze especially), Cher signed to Geffen in 1987 and recorded a rock album that finally got people to take  notice.\"I Found Someone\" may have not been written for Cher  (Laura Branigan recorded it a few years earlier), but Cher makes the song  her own.  It is a rocker!  \"We All Sleep Alone\" is an all-time  gem that even Cher had remixed to put on her BELIEVE album. Some of Cher's  best vocals are on this song. \"Perfection\" is an underrated gem,  you hear Cher at her diva peak on the album.While some of this albums  production sounds dated 13 years later (Jon Bon Jovi, Desmond Child,  Michael Bolton were all at the top of their game), for anyone who remembers  this period, this album is a must-have.\n", "val": 0.04002875089645386}

The other reviewers for this product are right on-- this is some really, really good stuff!I guess I was eight years old when I saw the movie for the first time in the theater, and I've been a big fan ever since. I remember crying my eyes out when my parents wouldn't order me the novel adaptation from the school book club (Yes, I had some issues!). I also remember getting in a lot of trouble when I traded my pencil box for my classmate's copy of it! Ah, the memories!In all seriousness, though-- this is a wonderful score. The different parts and movements flow very nicely together. Jen playing his pipes in the beginning, before he goes to see his dying master, and Jen and Kira's voice/pipes duet, when they are riding in the boat together, are just two examples of some of the beautiful music that's offered here. There are a lot of unusual instruments that are used, and the early 80's synth technology sounds great, too. If you're a fan, then I recommend picking this up, some way, somehow-- even if you have to use your lunch money!\n", "val": 0.044187165796756744}

{"text": "The Dark Crystal is a darn good quest movie loaded with mythical characters and bizarre landscapes. It has an interesting (though decidedly weird) plot that seems deeply steeped in Eastern philosophy.As with most movies worth seeing, The Dark Crystal relies heavily on music to help the audience make the transition from one scene to the next. In fact, The Dark Crystal is probably more dependent than the average film to make scenes work - the main characters are stiff-looking puppets after all! Some scenes would, in my opinion, fall flat or be reduced to silliness without the supporting soundtrack.The Dark Crystal soundtrack, like those composed for other better-known science fiction and fantasy epics, revolves around a common musical thread -- the protagonist's theme. There are interruptions in this thread of course, designed to deal with specific events (the death of the protagonist's mentor, the introduction of the protagonist's soul mate, and so forth).You do not have to see the movie to enjoy the movie's soundtrack. Since it was made to support puppet action most of the selections are particularly expressive and powerful.If you have a taste for the dramatic, epic or fanciful, you'll probably like The Dark Crystal soundtrack.\n", "val": 0.008099200204014778}

{"text": "Really great collection of the music from the Dark Crystal. Disk one is the OST, and while contains fewer works, they are presented as complete compositions, including parts of songs not present in the movie itself. Disk two, however, is the Score from the movie, with the tracks playing out like they do in the movie, including sudden transitions and stops.I like disk one because of the coherence of the music. For example, you get ot here the entire, albeit short, version of Kira's Gelfling Song (Track 9, Disk 1) and suprisingly plesant Pod Dance (Track 7). Also, there is less repetition of the various musical themes in disk one, as each peice gets to stand on its own.Disk two is nice because it contains a few edits that are worthwhile in my opinion. For example, the 'funeral' music for Jen's master in disk one uses a sysnthesiser (or some other electronic instrument) for the parts that are played by a stringed harp in the movie and disk two. Also, disk two contains the UrSkek ressurrection chant that is sadly omitted from the equivalent track in disk one.The set booklet has a few quotes from Trevor Jones from an interview, his bio, a short synopsis of the movie, and of course, the musician credits.\n", "val": 0.004126314073801041}

It's always been one of my fave movie scores for a very long time and one of the best movie scores of all time. It really sets the emotions and scenery of this remarkable motion picture to life from the chilling opening to the end credits of different tracks with it's brilliant finale score that blows the mind.A must have for any Dark Crystal fan, fantasy lover or movie music lover.\n", "val": 0.041939932852983475}
{"text": "The Dark Crystal is an amazing movie set in a wonderfully realized alien world, and the soundtrack is a perfect fit for the movie. The movie is a fantasy tale of the highest order so the music demands grand themes and dynamic textures that compliment the scenery and emotion of the film. Again, this soundtrack delivers with a full orchestra giving the music vibrant life.You want grandness? The main theme is as distinct and as enveloping as the best scores in film. I would put it up against the big name movie themes like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, 2001's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and more. When I hear the main theme I instantly recognize it as the sweeping and dynamic score to The Dark Crystal. Other pieces like The Landstrider Journey bring that theme up to a level of excitement and momentum befitting of the scene it was made for. When our hero Jen sets off on his journey the music is sweeping and emotional just as the backdrop in the movie is breathtaking. There are about a half dozen pieces to the soundtrack right now that stick in my head in a very good way when I let it. The music is that memorable.Some other pieces of the film work with what I can best describe as old European instrumentation and themes, and again they work wonderfully. It gives an ethnic flavor to the scenes they are made for. More so the music, on its own, makes for some great songs to listen to. The Pod Dance is a high energy celebration type song with the flutes and guitar and other instruments giving a wonderful texture of sounds. Jen Plays His Pipes (exclusive to this CD) is a mellow and melodic dual wood flute piece and Gelfling Song adds a female tonal voice set in a more reflective tone.The original soundtrack CD is great and comes with most of the most memorable music of the movie. However this limited edition set holds almost twice the music. Now that is not to say the single disk CD is not worth it. On the contrary the best music is on that CD, and if it weren't for the one song that I really wanted that the CD lacked (Jen Plays His Pipes) I would be putting my vote for that one. However not only does this edition have that one song I wanted it also have essentially the entire score to the film including incidental scoring and environmental sound bites.If you like the music to The Dark Crystal this is the CD to shoot for. However if the price tag is too high for you to want to pay and just want the best of the movie's music then&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Dark-Crystal-25th-Anniversary/dp/B000QEILB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Dark Crystal: 25th Anniversary</a>&nbsp;will do you fine.\n", "val": 0.037015900015830994}

{"text": "This set is 3 cd's,First is the album \"LotusFlow3r\". This disc alone is worth picking up the set. Wow. I love every track. Pure awesome all the way thru. I have heard some criticism of this album, but I don't get it. I could not be happier with this one.Second is the album \"MPLSsound\". I have to say, I was not a big fan of this disc when it came out.  I liked a few of the songs, but much of it felt bland and uninspired. I played this disc thru maybe 4 times over the course of a couple weeks, and it never sunk in for me.  That said, I recently gave it another spin, and It has grown on me a little. \"Chocolate Box\" and \"Never Be Another Like Me\" are still just okay. \"Dance 4 Me\" seems to be a favorite of many other Prince fans, I'm still on the fence. Same goes with \"No More Candy 4 U. \"U're Gonna C Me\"  \"Here\" and \"Better With Time\" are great. \"Old School Company\" is pretty good as well. \"Valentina\" is just weird. I happen to like it, but I can see this being a song that the majority dislike.Third cd is \"Elixer\" by Bria Valente. It is nice, smooth and pleasant, but also unremarkable, and for me unmemorable. I do enjoy the title track \"Elixer\" which is a duet with Prince. Seems like the word \"Elixir\" is alternated with \"he licks her\" which is classic Prince double meaning.\n", "val": 0.0056363679468631744}
{"text": "I can't imagine where all of the positive reviews for this album come from. Most of the \"music\" on it lacks anything desirable.I gave it one star because I couldn't give it anything less. Frankly, if you are a diehard Prince fan, you MIGHT be happy to have something new by Prince. However, if you're a Prince fan but not so desperate that you will accept junk just because it is PRINCE, then you are going to get really unhappy for buying this. Pretty much everything on this album is uninspiring. The best way I can put it is that if Prince were relying on this P.O.S to try to make his name in the music business, he would be living out of his car. NO music label would sign him (if he were unknown) if he handed them this P.O.S. as his demo tape. There is absolutely NOTHING about this album that is inspiring. I truly believe the high rankings this album has gotten are from : A) People hired by him to promote it B) Desperate fans that just want another album from Prince C) People on some sort of a drug induced frenzy.The first album \"Elixir\".... some chick Prince was promoting sings all this junk. I'll give it to the Gal tho, she is a good vocalist; just a shame she couldn't come up with one single good song to put on the CD to go with her vocals! Whatever the case is, this will probably be her one and only album because no one will look at her seriously after listening to this junk.(It's been 4 years now, and nope, no more albums from her.... HINT HINT HINT). The second album is just BORING, other than Crimson and Clover: and it's really not all that inspiring of a remake. The third album seriously sounds like some 13 year old kid sat in his room with his computer and some cheap music-making software and made up some songs, wrote some crummy lyrics to go with it, and then somehow blackmailed Prince into singing it. It's awful. And it just amazes me that the ONLY song on a 3-disc album by Prince that I actually somewhat like is a song he just re-made. How sad is that???Looking at all the junk albums Prince has put out over the last several years (Musicology, Rainbow Children, NEWS, Planet Earth. 3121, Lotusflow3r, just to name a few), the guy has either totally LOST his artistic creativity, or he has made too much money and simply doesn't have the drive to put out good albums like he used to. I dno't think the guy really knows what good music is anymore. Anyway, whatever the cause is, it all comes down to one simple fact: He hasn't had a song on the Radio in YEARS! Name ANY song he has had that has been on the air since 2000!!!! And it isn't because he is using his own label. If his music was good, it would be on the radio. So my best suggestion to all of you, whether you are a diehard fan, a past fan, or someone just now getting into the whole Prince experience, stay the heck away from any more of his albums until he actually produces something that's good enough to make it on the radio again. Until then, all these great ratings are truly just BS!I own pretty much every album Prince has done, and sadly, just when I thought he couldn't sink any lower, he had to go off and make Lotusflow3r just to prove me wrong.If I had to sum it up, this Lotusflow3r wreaks as though a dog walked up and took a big poo on it.....I had banned myself from buying anymore Prince music just because of the fact that all he ever releases anymore is just flat out garbage.... This album was released in 2009... and finally 4 years later I was stupid enough and curious enough (because of all the BS good ratings) to buy it. I am banning myself again, but this time I promise not to buy anything further from Prince unless it makes it on the radio as a hit (and not as something for people to puke over and laugh about). I am done. His \"music\" just sucks now.\n", "val": 1.3371736713452265e-05}

{"text": "This set includes two other albums: MPLSoUND and Elixir (by Bria Valiente).LotusFlow3r is still distinctly 00's Prince, the sounds that Prince has been playing with since 2001's The Rainbow Children (great album by the way, highly recommend it). However, this particular album takes on a much more rock-orientated sound, especially tracks such as \"Crimson & Clover\" and \"Colonized Mind\". Key tracks that should be listened to are \"Dreamer\" and \"Colonized Mind\". Personal favorites include \"77 Beverly Park\". MPLSoUND is much more pop-orientated, and somewhat reminiscent of 2006's 3121. The album lacks coherency and also is in no way designed to be listened as a complementary album to LotusFlow3r--it should be made clear that they are separate and distinct. One of the few popular tracks from this album is the danceable \"Dance 4 Me\", which Prince had remixed by several different DJs. However the key tracks in this album are really ultimately subjective, as there lacks a uniform consensus on this album as to what is key. Personal favorites include: \"Valentina\" a sexy song devoted to Salma Hayek and \"No More Candy 4 U\" which I find to be one of Prince's best songs in the 00's decade simply for its whimsical and strange sound and lyrics.Elixir is utterly throwaway, listen to it if you enjoy listening to Prince's proteges' work, but if not this album has no highlights whatsoever.\n", "val": 0.00017612178635317832}

{"text": "Some very catchable and dancy tracks here. Colonised Mind, Dreamer and Ol Skool Company are worth the purchase price alone. Prince has managed to sound like 2009 and yet also dredge up some of his 80s sound that made him so remarkable. Its the usual rump shakers and slow undress seduction ballads with a decent rocker or two thrown in. Lotusflow3r has a contemporary jazzy sound not unlike his other better 2000's albums, Musicology, 3121 and Planet Earth. MPLsOUND the better of the albums mixes up 3 frenetic dance numbers (There will never be another like me, Dance 4 Me and Chocolate box) some sexy ballads, a hardcore sex rap - Valentina and Ol Skool Company and excellent 80s style rap and then a assured number - No more candy 4 U. This is all fine except for the Bria Album, full of forgettable dance pop and steamy ballads. Its unexceptional sex kitten squeaking, but the Prince albums more than make up for this.

Now, first let me address this Bria Valente chick, does anyone know who she is? I have no clue. She can sing and some of the songs on her CD are alright, but I don't really feel it. The other two CD's, the Prince CD's, are awesome. I love every one of the songs, here are a couple that I genuinely find to be some excellent tracks: Crimson and Clover, Chocolate Box, Dance 4 Me, Valentina, and Love Like Jazz. I really like those songs. The album art is crazy hot and I like it a lot. It's different and that is what I expect and appreciate about Prince. I love his longevity and his varying style, he isn't afraid to try something different with his music, which is a trait that I think a lot of new era artists should find. I'm only 25, didn't listen to much Prince growing up, I didn't even like him at first, now I love his music. Shoot, I would have paid full price for the album, but as it was I only paid $1.

{"text": "Two things went through my mind as I listened to this album (the Prince discs--not even going to go into the girlfriend \"vanity\" disc). First I thought \"this sounds like every prince album I've heard in the past two decades.\" My second thought was \"And that stuff from the past two decades was kind of boring (except for Sexy MF).\"And now, after a second listen, I think my first instincts were correct. If you have no Prince in your collection, and you absolutely refuse to buy music from 20 year ago--by all means buy this cd. Even lame Prince is better than 90% of the new tuneless, formless, hack \"R&B\" that's out there. BUT if you want something that's actually \"good\" as opposed to \"better than garbage,\" you're going to need to dip into pre-1991 era Prince. Start with \"1999,\" or \"The Hits/The B-Sides\" or \"Sign O the Times.\"That's what I think anyway.\n", "val": 5.2510673413053155e-05}
{"text": "I am going by the strength of Prince's LotusFlow3r cd alone. The most I have heard, bro is good and I'm going to tell you, DON\"T SLEEP ON THIS!!! yes I was one of those waiting on Raspberry Beret 2010, but this stuff is great. And I don't blame him for holding on to his creativity to do his own stuff and market it via Target either. I am not happy that Prince has most of his stuff deleted off YouTube, but I guess when you had to go through a serious battle over your own name with a record label, take up a symbol, then come out of it with your sanity, I can't blame a brother not one darn bit. And the funny thing out of this, just as he talked on labels, so did Michael Jackson before he passed. But to get on to the LotusFlow3r cd, the brother is flexing his seemingly unlimited creativity with his cd; his take on Crimson and Clover, his insightful Colonized Mind, his jazzy yet naughty Love Like Jazz, and if Malcolm X was alive to hear Dreamer, he couldn't do nothing but holla. The brother is that good. And I'm sorry I slept on this. but right now at Target you can get it for $4.99 and feast your ears to something worth your time. You gotta get it and listen to one funky feast. UPDATE: I have since listened to the other two cds and feel I can say STILL the cd is worth it. Bria has a good voice personally, more like a jazzy feel. There were songs she sung made me feel I was intruding into her personal space. but she has talent. Her Kept Woman is noteworthy. All This Love is a good piece to all the sisters out there appealing to the brothers. I look forward to more offerings in the future. Prince's third set is funky and GOOD. I sense his earlier naughtiness in the first lines of Dance 4 Me. Chocolate Box keep you moving. his Valentina asks a young girl to have her mom call him when she's too busy chasing her. too smooth. His Ol Skool Company, he goes out and out and talks on politics(the bailout)as well as fellow younger artists while grooving to his funky beat.

{"text": "Let me just say tha I can't believe that I waited so long to post a review. I bought these cd's when they were first released. This is Prince at his Rockin, funky best. No frills here , just solid jams.The first cd  Elixer show cases new Prince protege Bria Valente. It took me a while to warm up to this disc, because I foolishly went on critiques of the music rather than listening for myself. Is Bria Valente a strong vocalist in the vein of Mary J. Blige or Chaka or Aretha Franklin? No. She is however an easy artist to listen to. Critics were way too hard on her , when artist like Britney spears, who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket, never seem to recieve criticism for their lack of vocal talent. Elixer is a solid cd that is certainly worth listening to. Great cd to play for a romantic evening, especially the songs \"Here I Come \" and Elixer.Lotus Flow3r show cases Prince's rock side. My favorite tracks o this disc are Crimsom an clover, $, Colonized Mind, and Love Like Jazz. I have recently gotten into the track entitled dreamer as well. Lotusflow3r is an extrordinary cd for anyone who loves guitar heavy tracks.MPLS Sound is my favorite of the three cds , since funk is my favorite genrre of music. This cd is so funky it makes your stomach hurt. Chocolate Box featuring Q-Tip is the monster jam on this cd with  Dance 4 Me running a tight second Valentina and Another like me hold a tie for third. These songs are so retro 80's Prince funky , yet they sound as fresh as anything on the radio today. My slow Jam from this album is Your'e Gonna C Me. Here and Better With Time are vintage Prince. They just have his style all over them. Ol School Company takes fourth place among the funk jams on this disc , but it is still a solid track. No More Candy 4 U has a big band feel to it. The song reminds me of stomping prince rock- a - billy tracks like  Delirious, Let's Pretend We're Married and Play in the Sunshine ,only this one stomps harder .These three cd's were  worth their price and then some .\n", "val": 0.015530204400420189}
{"text": "I don't think I've given a Prince record one star in a long time, but this one was practically begging for it.Prince treads old ground here for at least the fourth or fifth time, delivering a searingly bad message-laden effort accompanied by forgettable music.  At three discs you want to hope that there is something salvageable here, but it's a mash of throw-away tracks that sound like tracks he used to give to other, failed bands.  The \"Lotus\" record is an airy mess, filled with lazy writing and retread energy.  The \"MPLSound\" record has all of the funk that was missing on the \"Lotus\" disc but still fails to do more than frustrate.  Even the welcome return of his sonic palette (hello pitched tom toms!) only elevates these tracks to music I still won't be listening to a week from now.  Finally, there is the included \"non-Prince\" record, singer Bria Valente's \"Elixer\" (misspelled for no apparent reason), which is thoroughly produced by Prince.  Valente is not without merit as a vocalist, and of the three records in this set this is the one that doesn't sound like a complete throwaway.  At the same time, it's hardly inspiring.  It's worth noting that this record - not the two proper Prince albums - contains the sole song worth having out of this whole set: the title track \"Elixer\", which is a powerful slow-grind of a duet with Prince.  That's it: one track worthy of his genius.I would challenge anyone to find a mere eight songs that would make one good album out of this material, but this 3-panel set doesn't have eight songs on it anyone will care about that isn't on the payroll.  If his vault is filled with 1000 songs of stuff that sounds like this, then someone should forget the combination.  A waste for anyone who isn't a completist or fanatic, who would even have to admit that at 25 albums deep, this one isn't even in the top 15.

Rainbow Children, N.E.W.S, Chaos and Disorder were released to minimal, if any, fanfare, which was probably a conscious decision of the Artist. These are all solid, well crafted discs. Musicology, 3121, Rave unto the Joy Fantastic, Planet Earth, and this, his latest release, all had some kind of promotional push, or new contract signing attached to them. The results? A few good tunes, with alot of filler. Prince needs to get back to releasing works which are not influenced by attempts at mass market appeal. THOSE are the works that shine in their entirety.\n", "val": 0.029492082074284554}

{"text": "This is not Prince's best and not his worst either.  With the added Bria Valente cd, it gives Lotusflow3er the extra spice it needs to be a bonafied Prince classic affair.  With 3 cds to choose from, each cd can conjur up whatever Prince mood your in.  I actually got really into the Bria cd, it's new and fresh music you don't quite hear anymore.  It's like Vanity lite with a breathe mint.  Her voice is a little more soulful than Vanity and Apollonia but still evokes that latina passion intensity we all have grown to love.  Here is a breakdown of her album:1. Here Eye Come:  5/5  a sexual groove with cool lyrics and vocals.  I think Prince had to write this song.  I imagine it being played in a love scene with Eva Longoria on Desperate Housewives.  Strange!2. All This Love: 4/5  a drippy love jam u can sing a long 2.3. Home: 5/5  the best song on the cd.  The lyrics and vocals are Bria at her best.  It reminds me of something Martika would have sung 4 Prince during that era in the 90's.4. Something U Already Know: 3/5  ur basic Bria jam, they could've added alittle sumthin sumthin to make it stand out more.5. Everytime: 4/5  She has a video to this song, only saw a clip.  It's a airy jazzy jam that grows on u.6. 2Nite: 3/5  I think they intended this 2 be a club jam but it comes across as amateur dance material with Vanity type vocals.7. Anotha Boy: 3/5  If we lived in another world this could be a #1 pop hit but we ain't livin' in that kinda world no mo.  Cute song but it's not the 80's.8. Kept Woman: 5/5  My fave song.  I can play it over and over. I love the lyrics and vocals are amazing.  Bria shows that she's not a one trick pony.9. Immersion: 4/5  a mystical groove with creative and intense lyrics.  It puts u in a trance of Bria's mysterious world.10. Elixer: 4/5  A strange duet with Prince.  A foreshadow of what's to come in Lotusflow3er.Lotusflow3er is the centerpiece of this Prince affair.  It's the mystical cd that is more grounded in Beatlesque mystique and rooted in rock, rhythm and blues.1. From The Lotus: 2/5  not quite into this ordinary elevator type music intro.2. Boom: 3/5  Tick, Tick Boom..... I liked that song better than this.  It's a typical Prince rock jam that doesn't hit the mark for me.  Not a memorable song in my oppinion.3. Crimson and Clover: 5/5  considering I perform this song live, Prince copied me!  I love his version but what ruins it for me is the fading in and out of the vocals.  He ruined the song for me by doing this, the effect does not work, it makes it seem like there's something wrong with your stereo.4. 4Ever: 4/5  a soulful luv groove, peace luv and happiness.  Prince could have added more to the song to make it more creative.5. Colonized Mind: 5/5  my fave song.  I heard someone jamming this in their car and it sparked up a Prince conversation.  I luv the lyrics and the vibe on this one.  Classic Prince.6. Feel Good, Feel Better..: 4/5  a jazzy Prince jam that will sound great performed live.7. Love Like Jazz: 3/5  Ok Prince we get it.8. 77 Beverly Park: 3/5  instrumental groove that sounds a bit like the instrumentation of the song \"With You\".  A friend played this song on repeat for literally 2 weeks to chase a roomate out of his apartment b cuz he didn't pay his rent.9. Wall Of Berlin: 4/5  a rock affair with crazy Prince lyrics.  it has 2 grow on u.10. $: 5/5  a funky Prince jam with cool vocals.  Luv or $?  $$$!11. Dreamer: 4/5  guitar oriented Prince jam thatrocks u out.12. Back 2 Lotus: 2/5  filler track not needed.MPLSOUND is Prince covering all of his previous sounds from the past. It's like Prince imitating Prince, if that makes sense.  i prefer his previous work but this is cool new Prince stuff so ya can't complain.1. There'll Never be Another: 4/5  a bit repetative but has a cool breakdown.  His name is Prince!2. Chocolate Box: 3/5  I really liked it at first but after a couple listens, it gets so repetative and goes on for 2 long.  That worked on the 1999 album but not here!3. Dance 4 Me: 5/5  my fave song on the cd.  Camille returns on vocals, a party jam 4 me and U.4. U're Gonna C Me: 4/5  Entertainment Weekly said this is the best song on the entire LotusFlow3er cd collection.  Not quite but it is a cute slow jam with infectuous lyrics.  Not Prince's best!5. Here: 3/5  Ugh......that's it, just Ugh.6. Valentina: 4/5  a song that makes u wanna ask Prince the story behind this song.  Who is he singing about, Sofia Loren??  A strange song and a bit repetative.7. Better With Time: 3/5  another one of those new Prince ballads that just doesn't compare to the classics, \"Insatiable\", \"Do Me Baby\" etc... How will he ever top himself.  It sounds like Prince wanted to make this a hit, good luck.8. Ol Skool Company: 2/5  I'm sorry I hate this song.  This is the same artist who did \"Housequake\"?  This is a pale imitation of a dance jam Prince used to be able to do.  He could have added some old skool samples, the beat is lazy and just stupid.  He does give shout outs to Sheila E and The Time.9. No Mo Candy 4 U: 5/5  maybe he wrote this song about me, cuz it sounds like I'm dissing Prince on the internet.  hey, i don't have to like EVERY song on a prince album, but I love this song.  It's Dirty Mindesque, the vocals are spazzy and intense and the song has a raw 80's energy.  Yes Prince, I want some mo candy, baby!!!! GIVE IT 2 ME!\n", "val": 0.016354398801922798}

{"text": "I have been listening to Prince's work for 27 years, and he has the ability to surprise you when you think you've seen all of what he can do. But lately I feel that the huge stuff that he's releasing, although it could mean a present to all his fans, is a little too much. Where is the importance of a song when there are 30 or 40 songs released a year? Where is the importance of a good recording, the time to digest the album? With this large amount of material he could wait only 2 or 3 years and put the best songs together... but there is another problem: wich are the best songs? He is doing a lot of soul-ultradesigned songs, and only a few of these are what I call interesting songs. I'm sure he likes a lot all he does, but what about the criteria an artist has to apply to his work, he must think about the people who buy his records, and maybe we want something more than see one or two cds in the stores a year. Maybe we don't need overproduced sounds, maybe we miss songs with only an acoustic guitar, like those on The Truth, or a trio performing some blues, or rock, or funk, or whatever. I have to say that I believe in songs, not in albums, but since the industry (or whatever it may be right now) is what it is, an album has to include a decent number of decent songs.And lately I have been feeling that his are a pretend records, I think due to the mentioned overproduction, or maybe due to the covers, with all these colors, and collages. To finish, I wish future Prince's records were more simple and a little less often. He is good musician enough to do a couple of masterful songs.Regarding to the album, \"Lotusflow3r\" is nice, with some interesting songs, and sounds too. Mplsound could have remained unreleased (I mean what I say, I'm not saying is unbearable), and I haven't heard Elixer yet (is good marketing for the girl, but I'm not sure I understand it being part of a Prince record).I'm happy with the comparison The L.A. Times did with Lotus, saying that some chords sound like Steely Dan tunes. We are in the good way after all...PD.: Another wish.

{"text": "So I was so excited to find that Prince wanted to try yet another marketing ploy to sell albums...giving them away pissed people off...selling them with tickets pre-release caused bootlegging...Target is a good place to get your music sold, because they compete with Wal-Mart...Cool...Now when it comes to the music, I find a lot to be savored here.  I am still not really into the LotusFlow3r disc.  Too experimental for me, but I know that I will probably learn to love and appreciate it soon.  MPLSound is a masterpiece.  The first time I heard (There'll Never B) Another Like Me, I was hoping it would go on for at least ten minutes. That beat just hooks you. Chocolate Box has a nice rock/electro/hip-pop sound and features Q-Tip.  There are no duds on this record though.  Seriously.  I love the 80's style throwbacks he threw in here.  He even echoes a more masculine \"Camille\" song on Dance 4 Me.  I'm in heaven.  His prime was in the 80's and now that he can relive it in 2009 I couldn't be happier.  Bria Vallente...HMM...That's all I really have to say.  There's not much there. She breathes, trills, quivers...with no real feeling.  It isn't like the classy vacancy that Shiela E. or even Appolonia used to have.  She's just there to look cute, and hang out on Prince's arm.  The music itself is nice, so I can't say I hate it...but I wish that Prince would get back with Rosie Gaines and get her to release something with him behind it. That would be amazing.  But even though I'm being critical I can recommend this CD to Prince fans and anyone who wants a nice fun 80's throwback from the MPLSound album.  It really is a masterwork from Prince.  Hopefully I'll get into the LotusFlow3r side soon...Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.017949292436242104}

{"text": "I have to say I have been a fan for a very long time. But for some reason \"Planet Earth and This record are just not exciting me\". Colonized Mind is obviously and I mean obviously the crown Jewell on the second disc. Nothing else was really outstanding or even memorable. On Elixer I liked the song \"HOME\" I thought it was pretty futuristic and groovy. But for the 3rd disc, the first 3 tracks were decent and that was it. The rest of the album sounded like retreads not anything revolutionary or inspired. This is a huge step above 2007's Planet Earth. I pretty much wrote that whole album off when I heard it. 2004's musicology and 2006's 3121 are pretty much his best albums of this decade. They actually sounded like fresh tunes and not from \"THE VAULT\". And if you want to get into his best Underground records ? I would have to say \"THE CHOCOLATE INVASION and SLAUGHTERHOUSE where really good. What happened to the futuristic sounds he once had and the innovation ? The guy still looks amazing for his age and could still pull of the younger generation if tried.  This is a decent effort but it sounds to plain for someone so eccentric. I am giving this three stars because there are some great songs on here and the Price point was excellent. HOME, COLONIZED MIND, CRIMSON AND CLOVER, 2NITE, CHOCOLATE BOX and ANOTHER LIKE ME and ANOTHER BOY. Are easily the standouts on this 3 disc set not masterpieces just standouts. If I had to pick a Masterpiece I would have to go with \"COLONIZED MIND\". I think this should have been a single album.

Versatile, dynamic and diverse music composition and production is a bargain at any price, but \"LotusFlow3r\" is an extreme bargain at under $15.00, including protege' musical artist, \"Bria Valente\" who's sultry smokey voice adds an \"old school\" Jazz/Blues air the likes of \"Billie Holiday\" and \"Nancy Wilson\" to the \"Elixir\" CD.Few artist are capable of reading, writing, composing and producing at the same time, and Music aficionados and audiophiles will grasp the melodic elegance and eloquence of this 3 CD set from the very first listening, while others will discover further and more enjoyment the more they listen to each! \"Prince\" backs off of the extreme 'music-compression' method, unlike many of today's productions and the result is crisp, clear, highly resounding vocals and instrumentals which are only limited by the quality of one's listening equipment; evidenced by the flawless absence of the 'twing' that we normally hear when guitar-artists are strumming the strings of their guitars.

This being the case, The central disc of this trilogy: Lotusflow3r is powerful. When performed live on Jay Leno, \"Dreamer\" and \"Feel Good...\" sounded ever more complete, vocally and musically!  I don't need to go into detail to tell you that if you like The Funk, Rock, Punk, Jazz amalgamations of Prince, this disc will be spinning in your player or on your I-pod on repeat.  Elixir by Bria Valiente is pretty like her lips.  The music is first rate and transitions smoothly from track to track. There are some great standout tracks like Elixer, Another Boy and others. She can sing, but sometimes on the record I feel that she's playing it safe. It's not that she isn't a good singer, but people may be harder on her because she's not Prince. She may win them over with a live performance, if it's good. MPLS Sound is great here and there ( Old School Company, Valentina ) but I'm still giving this disc time.  At first listen, I haven't taken to the music as a whole.  Still, for all he has done and his consistency and dedication to his art, Prince is exemplary of the potential of an artist when he has discipline and spiritual stability.

{"text": "\"LotusFlow3r\" is easily Prince's best album since 1997's \"The Truth\" (aka Disc 4 of \"Crystal Ball\"), and possibly since 1995's \"The Gold Experience.\" It has a great overall flow and sounds like a complete album, unlike hodgepodges such as \"Planet Earth,\" \"3121,\" and \"Musicology.\"  The focus is on cohesive pop and rock songs, without the conceptual mumbo-jumbo that ruined the otherwise musically inventive \"Rainbow Children.\"Each track on \"LotusFlow3r\" is worthwhile, especially the brilliant \"4ever\" - one of Prince's best pure pop songs in many a year.  The album drips with intense guitar soloing, which saves even the somewhat uninspired Hendrix rip \"Dreamer\" (a little too close to \"Voodoo Child\").  Some of the album is instrumental, including the bookends \"From the Lotus...\" and \"...Back 2 the Lotus\" which open and close the album, but they are musically strong.  \"77 Beverly Park\" is an acoustic guitar based instrumental that is among the loveliest trifles Prince has released in some time.  \"Love Like Jazz\" is funny (intentionally, I believe), and \"Wall Of Berlin\" builds up serious momentum.There really isn't much downside to \"LotusFlow3r,\" except when comparing it to Prince's true masterworks.  With especially strong vocals, a live rhythm section throughout, and (for the first time in too long) plenty of hooks, the album sits comfortably alongside other second-tier Prince discs.  It ain't \"Parade\" or \"Lovesexy,\" but the man is never likely to scale those heights ever again.  However, it's a kick to hear him so focused and inspired.Then there's \"MPLSound,\" the second of two all-new Prince albums.  While the album is nearly as focused as \"Lotus,\" it's unfortunately focused on the stale, electro-beat dance crud that Prince has glutted his discography with for the past ten years.  The opening three songs are overlong, largely melody-free, and worst of all BORING.  Mid-album, things pick up a bit, with the ballad \"U're Gonna C Me\" (which was previously released in a far superior alternate version on \"One Night Alone\") and a satisfying mid-tempo pop tune \"Here.\"  \"MPLSound\" peaks with the stunning ballad \"Better With Time,\" though even that song is somewhat marred by a too-loud drumtrack.  \"Valentina\" is an embarrassment, a lust letter to Salma Hayek addressed to her toddler daughter (\"Hey Valentina, tell yo' mama she should give me a call\").As for Bria Valente's Prince-produced debut, \"Elixer,\" I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though Ms. Valente's voice is thin and unremarkable, Prince has written and produced a solid album in the 'smooth jazz' vein that is actually more listenable than \"MPLSound.\"  The title track, a tantalizing duet between Prince and Valente, is the sexiest creation by Prince in years.  \"Kept Woman,\" \"Something U Already Know,\" and \"Immersion\" are all highlights.  I expected \"Elixer\" to be a total throwaway, yet it turned out to be a the second best of the three discs.Bottom line: \"LotusFlow3r,\" while not a true return-to-form, is a kickin' guitar rock work-out with Prince's best tunes in eons.  I consider the other two discs to be more like \"bonus\" material, especially since the package is so economically priced.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention \"No More Candy 4 U\" - this killer throwback to the \"Controversy\"-era is classic Prince.\n", "val": 0.03581967577338219}

{"text": "The problem with people like Prince, and with most other music legends; Stevie Wonder, Donna Summer, Al Green, Bob Dylan to mention a few, is this; some people are stuck back in the day when they were at their peak and thus nothing new they ever put out can ever be good in their opinion. If you put that aside, they are still making good music today, much better than most current artists. I certainly enjoyed Prince's last 3 CDs \"Musicology\", \"3121\", and \"Planet earth\".This time around, Prince releases 2 CDs simultaneously, the Rockier, more guitar driven \"Lotusflow3r\", and the Funkier \"Mplsound\", showcasing two sides of the maestro. Which disc you prefer depends on what style of music you prefer. This is a review of the Prince discs only. I found the third disc (by his new protege) just ok.\"Lotusflow3r\" opens with a psychedelic sounding guitar instrumental, leading into the snarling \"Boom\". Other songs in a similar mode are \"Wall of Berlin\" and \"Dreamer\". \"The morning after\" is bouncy Pop/Rock a la \"Raspberry beret\" or \"Cinnamon girl\". \"Colonized mind\" is a truly awesome groovy ballad with hints of Hendrix and lyrics about racism/Political intrigue/injustice. Definitely the standout. \"Feel good, feel better, feel wonderful\" is a slice of James Brown-slice funk, choppy and incredibly groovy. The aptly titled \"Love like jazz\" is a lilting Jazzy ballad. \"77 Beverly Park\" is a lovely instrumental with delicately plucked guitars and a smooth Jazz feel. Closing the disc is the instrumental \"...Back 2 the lotus\" which sounds like a jam session.\"Mplsound\" comprises just 9 tracks but they are generally longer than those on \"Lotusflow3r\". The disc opens with the upbeat choppy Funk \"(There'll never B) Another like me\" with blistering guitars. Highly infectious! Just as groovy is \"Dance 4 me\". \"Chocolate box\" has a Pop feel and semi-spoken lyrics, while the midtempo Funk \"Ol' skool company\" has him singing in that Camille voice over a languid groove. \"No more candy 4 U\" is bouncy Pop/Rock with piano rather than guitar pushed to the fore. The rest of the album comprises ballads, standouts being \"Here\" (with some falsetto and a spoken bridge), \"Valentina\", and the piano ballad \"Better with time\" (and he does sound it).Certainly not his best CD, but definitely nothing to be sneezed at either.

Someone as talented as Prince has tons of stuff in his vaults that we'll probably never hear not to mention the fact, thatt his \"worst\" is far better than anything you hear on radio today. There are so many artists now trying to be the new \"prince\" listen to most r&b artists out there and u will see what i mean. Why do people always go back to the 80's? and why do people always want him to do another \"purple rain\" or \"kiss\". if u ever notice no one but prince could have pulled off the song \"kiss\" No one in today's geration even comes close to meeting him on his level. His guitar playing is off the charts, and his live performances are eviable of even the best people out there today. Did anyone see him on the Rock N' Roll hall of fame? where  he is on stage with great players, great musicians and talented singers? somehow without uttering a word and simply by playing \"while my guitar gently weeps\" he totally blue everyone away, Tom Petty even seemed to be staring in disbelief at his showmanship. My point is the two prince cds that are included here, are not gonna change the world but they are great songs. Something u can listen to. The ballads are beautiful and takes u back to when a man actually loved his woman and didn't consider his girl to be a bitch that he had to smack up. I have not listened to the bria valente cd yet, well not with my full attention. But this is more or less a prince project, so we'll just talk about his part in it. The songs are great. I don't see Prince being too innovative or even provacative anymore, simply because if there was something innovative to be done, he's already done it already. I never understood why everyone hated \"new power soul\" it was a great cd as well, but just because it wasn't groundbreaking everyone gave it bad reviews. He was simply singing songs with his band and having fun. Someone like him does not have to reinvent the wheel everytime he releases a cd. He's basically been there and done everything. That's not to say he's crusing either. There are great songs. Lotusflow3r is filled with great guitar driven songs, while MPLSOUND pretty much has that old school prince flavor while still sounding new. I would definitely reccomend this 3cd set to anyone who is either a prince fan (die hard or moderate) to those who just want to hear great music. to see how it should be done. I think everyone holds prince to an unobtainable standard. he's never gonna sound like 1984 Prince, because it's not 1984. I remember when around the world in a day came out and parade, no one seemed to like them either or \"get it\" but those were the first two albums that totally got me hooked on his music, before then I only listened to the top40 he was one of the first artists to make me see that the best songs never quite make it to radio. The album tracks were the stroger one. and history usually judges prince cds better than say most critics. Entertainment weekly only favors him anyway when it's a Warner Brothers Release as they are owned by Time Warner. So do not listen to critics or supposed die hard prince fans, as any realy prince fan knows anyone who says Purple Rain was his best isn't really a serious fan of his work. I'm glad i can listen to 2cds and not hear what everyone calls \"consistancy\" they want all the songs to have a singular purpose or sound. Prince can't be tied down, the styles/genres are simply more tools at his disposal everything he does is devoted to great music. so if one song doesn't sound like it really belongs on the same album with the rest, I don't care, as long as they are good songs. Concept albums are great, but 99 percent of all albums are not concept albums. So enjoy the variety, it is so refreshing after hearing today's hits, to hear someone who can take any genre and bend it to their own personal liking. Even without the bargain price of this set, i'd reccomend it to anyone who loves good music. It's all just good ol' fashioned purple rock n' roll. so enjoy.\n", "val": 0.001653307699598372}
{"text": "This has to be the triple album of the year! No body is gonna put out anything near this anytime soon. The surprise for me is that the album Prince has put together for Bria Valente's is probably the BEST protege album he's ever done (since maybe's Sheila E's first album). The title track \"Elixer\" is just as good as the best tracks on the Prince albums.LotusFlow3r will go down in history as a classic. Its a grower. The 1st listen may not hook you, but after you hear it in its entirety from beginning to end 2-3 time you realize the work that went into it and the sheer brilliance of it all. MPLSound is just hot from the very beginning. Very nostalgic 80's sound to it. \"No More Candy 4 U\" is brilliant! \"Here\" and \"Better with Time\" are also very beautiful compositions. Too bad that as an idie artist he won't get any radio play. But, the cost of this set is worth any one of these CD's alone. So, its a definite bargain.\n", "val": 0.03703400492668152}
{"text": "I own all of Prince's albums, and I listened to them all, in chronological order, leading up to the release of \"Lotusflow3r\".Any time Prince releases a double or triple or quadruple album I am instantly skeptical. Most artists can not pull off a double album. This holds true for Prince with the exception of \"Sign O The Times\". In general, \"Lotusflow3r\" would have benefitted from being condensed into one album, not two. I think half of \"Lotusflow3r\" and half of \"MPLSound\", combined, would have made a four star album.\"Elixer\" by Bria Valente, I didn't even bother with.This is Prince, after all, and that is who I am critiquing.\"Lotusflow3r\": A combination of psychedelic funk rock a la Jimi Hendrix, Curtis Mayfield, Sly and the Family Stone and James Brown, with a sprinkle of Herbie Hancock. \"From The Lotus...\" opens the album in a breezy, relaxed jazz mood--this is Prince in his effortless best. This segues into \"Boom\", a psychedelic Jimi Hendrix number that works more often than not. This segues into a more psychedelic cover of Tommy James & The Shondells' \"Crimson & Clover\" replete with an interpolation of The Troggs' \"Wild Thing\"--love it or hate it, I liked it, and I'm a big fan of Joan Jett's definitive version. \"4Ever\" is relatively decent, but nothing exciting. The Curtis Mayfield informed \"Colonized Mind\" echoes Mayfield's \"If There's A Hell Below...We're All Gonna Go\". By far, one of Prince's best songs here. The James Brown influenced \"Feel Good, Feel Better, Feel Wonderful\" is some of Prince's best funk on the entire set. \"Love Like Jazz\" is tepid. \"77 Beverly Park\" is an interesting Italian serenade instrumental--something you would not expect from Prince. \"Wall Of Berlin\" is amusing, but not quite sustainable, while \"$\" is more interesting, but also not quite sustainable. \"Dreamer\" brings back Hendrix in the album's other socio-political statement--one of the better tracks here. \"...Back 2 The Lotus\" uneventfully closes the disc as the third instrumental here.\"MPLSound\" is supposed to be a return to Prince's 80's heyday. It sounds like he rifled through \"1999\", \"Sign O The Times\" and \"Lovesexy\" leftovers and tried to make something of them. The result is very uneven, and honestly, I would have preferred a futuristic funk extravaganza rather than a trip down memory lane. \"(There'll Never B) Another Like Me\" kicks things off to a funky groove, but ultimately the song is unmemorable. \"Chocolate Box\" is better, but still feels rather stale. \"Dance 4 Me\" rekindles that old Prince funk, and is probably one of the best tracks on the set. \"U're Gonna C Me\" is dreadful balladry. \"Here\" is tropical and a bit better, but still unmemorable. \"Valentina\" is boring, and \"Better With Time\" is equally dull. \"Ol' Skool Company\" is pretty good, one of the better tracks, but it goes on for two minutes too long. \"No More Candy 4 U\" is another funky track that works, and is one of the sets better songs.As a long time Prince fan and appreciator \"Lotusflow3r\" fell below expectations.

{"text": "4.29.09.  the date prince became irrelvant.it also happens to be the release date of his 25th collection `lotus flow3r`, arguably one of his most passion-less releases.it's not that the 3-cd set that is lotus flow3r (also including MPLSoUND and bria valente's elixer) are terrible records - its just that they are fairly rote offerings from the guy that used to challenge at every turn (scratch that, elixer is a truly terrible record).for certain there are some great tracks here, particularly the swagger of chocolate box, the funk of dance 4 me and the burning politic of colonized mind.  and much of MPLSoUND is great, but the flashes of brilliance are few and far between.back in the day a prince release promised amazing soundscapes, raunchy funk and sweet pop all thrown in a blender and blended to a fever-pitch of new power funk (see kiss, mountains or hot thing for 3 examples) - he would challenge his listeners (by way of challenging himself) to consider new musical forms and styles.  the records were hardcore, sexy, playful and simply demanded that you pour over every note non-stop for weeks after the release.  the music was thick, rich and fun.the tunes on lotus flow3r are slight, forgettable (for the most part) and generally un-inspired.i won't blame this (as others have) on his jehovah witness faith.  the sacred and the profane have always danced a thin line in the world of prince - and certainly his tremendous love of god has informed some of the strongest tunes in his canon.  rather, i think his ego has taken control and  these songs are a lackluster attempt at chasing his history.  the bravado and strut here is but a shadow of his better works (not to mention his complete obsession with money and control) and detracts from the music.what made prince so utterly brilliant on albums like controversy, parade and lovesexy was that he simply did not care what other people were doing.  he was following his own musical bliss and we were better for it.  while the prince on this album is channelling the ghost of hendrix (and chasing current pop chartoppers).  he's clearly fighting for relevance here and missing the boat.  prince is hands down more talented than anyone currently ruling the charts - he would be well served by remembering that his unique voice is what makes his music better.back in the day he wisely surrounded himself with musicians that challenged him and pushed him forward.  folks like wendy & lisa, sheila e & eric leeds were critical to that classic sound.  its no surprise then that his current band seems more comfortable following their leader's direction, rather than inspiring him to greater heights.  one gets the distinct impression he is surrounded by yes men.in 2009, prince seems more comfortable ruling the concert stage, than in putting out music that is inspired and unique.  and who can blame him?  pop audiences are terribly fickle and (truth be told) boring (how else do you explain generic tunes topping the charts?).  prince has always been the king of the concert stage, so one can hardly fault him for retreating to that world, where he can really play to his strengths - but at the end of the day, the vegas revue stylings of his recent outings will become stale without strong original music to back it up.with all that said, the moments of brilliance here (better with time, feel good, feel better, feel wonderful) are great reminders of why we fell in love with prince in the first place.one just wishes there were  more moments like those.\n", "val": 0.00013107771519571543}

{"text": "If only 3 disc sets always came at single album prices!  That aside, I feel like the work here is solid from an almost 51 year-old artist who hasn't lost his touch.  'LotusFlow3r' as an album is my favorite of the cds, but the other two continue to grow on me with repeated listens.  'MPLsound' is pretty much what I expect from Prince, not breaking any new ground.  It is enjoyable however if you just want to hear some funky stuff with a couple of ballads thrown in.  He still manages to keep it current although the sound is reminiscent of older work.  'Elixer' benefits from good production and musicianship.  Bria Valente isn't the best vocalist but gets by with a smooth sound that the music compliments(even if she's outshined a bit).  She does get welcome help from her mentor on the title track though.  The overall package is good, if a bit uneven, and Prince shows why he's a legendary hall-of-famer both with his own work and his protege's.  Back to 'Lotus' for a second though.  I feel Prince never gets his due as a true guitarist.  Oh sure, it's acknowledged he's good, even somtimes said he's great.  He should be mentioned amongst some of the biggest axe-men to play a lick and this cd is another example of why.  The man repeatedly scortched guitars throughout his career, and now at middle age(!) continues to do so with ease like a true veteran.  I feel he sounds fresh and revitalized on 'LotusFlow3r' moreso than 'MPLsound'(though he still sounds good here too).  Anyhow, thanks for more music for our buck.

{"text": "LOTUSFLOW3R.  One of the Purple One's most diverse efforts, which wouldn't mean that it's necessarily good--but in fact it's one of his most exciting albums, dancing through future noir jazz (\"From the Lotus...\") to modern urban blues (\"Colonized Mind\") into Seventies-style R&B (\"Feel Good, Feel Better, Feel Wonderful\") and out through vaguely Hendrixian guitar anthem (\"Dreamer\").  It shines like an aquatic kingdom of rock and soul, sounds the part, too, painting Prince as some sort of interstellar pop king of Neptune.  And he resurrects the hell out of \"Crimson and Clover.\"  B+MPLSOUND.  It was anticipated as a return to the sound of his \"Purple Rain\" days, which it kind of is.  More so, Mr. Nelson takes a few lines from his Revolution-era songbook and then adapts his music for the modern music scene, where beat-driven hip-hop rules.  \"(There'll Never B) Another Like Me\" is kind of groovy, but the dark beat of \"Chocolate Box\" hits closer to the mark.  The rest are all close enough to the bullseye to be interesting, but Prince doesn't seem to care much about hitting the mark, as though he was watching a girl behind the bar while he's tossing the darts.  Good for when you're in the party mood, but \"1999\" is better--and for that matter, so is \"Purple Rain.\"  For inspiration: \"I like it when you dance 4 me.\"  BBria Valente: ELIXIR.

{"text": "Prince has never been the kind of artist who you can force into one genre. One constant about him is that he is always changing and trying something new whether mainstream audiences or even his most hardcore fans like it or not. His body of work is so vast that I am always leery of people who try to compare everything to his 1980's work. He has tried so many different styles since then that it seems foolish to continue to compare new efforts to work from more than two decades ago. It would be different if he hadn't consistently released music since the 1980s. However, he's been steadily releasing albums every one to two years for his entire career. People who can just listen to Prince's music as music and stop comparing it to 25 years ago tend to enjoy his new stuff. The others just seem to be stuck in the past waiting for Raspberry Beret 2009.Fans who like diverse music styles will love the two Prince albums that are part of this 3-CD set. The LotusFlow3r CD is the centerpiece of this hat trick. It offers blazing rock, whimsical jazz, funk and soul. The musicianship and production on this disc are top notch. The sound is organic and real. The standout tracks include \"Colonized Mind,\" \"Dreamer,\" \"Love Like Jazz,\" \"Boom,\" \"Wall of Berlin,\" and the cover \"Crimson and Clover.\" However, there really aren't any bad tracks. This is a spirited album that experiments, yet its creativity is accessible. The energy of it grabs you more and more each time you listen to it. As a solo disc, I would give LotusFlow3r 5 stars.The second disc, Mplsound, has more of a back to the future feel to it. It mixes some of today's styles and production techniques with those of the past. There is some up-tempo R&B and Funk here as well as some ballads. Some of the attempts at the modern Pop/R&B sound like \"Chocolate Box\" and \"There'll Never Be Another\" miss the mark for me. However, the standouts are the infectious party cut \"Dance 4 Me;\" the catchy R&B track \"Valentina,\", the retro P-funk inspired \"Old Skool Company,\" and the beautiful ballads \"U're Gonna C Me\" and \"Better with Time.\" As a solo effort, I would give Mplsound 3.5 stars.Elixer, the final disc, is by Prince's latest protg Bria Valente. Overall, this disc is somewhat languid. Valente's vocals aren't very dynamic or interesting. Most of the tracks do benefit from great musicianship and production. However, unless you are in an easy listening mood, this one might put you to sleep. There are some up-tempo offerings but they never really take off. The standouts are the sultry ballads \"Here Eye Come,\" \"Something U Already Know\" and \"Elixer,\" which is a duet with Prince whose vocals are exquisite but also highlight the limitations of Valente's vocals. Another standout is \"Immersion,\" which is an interesting song that might have really hit the mark if performed by a singer who was a better fit for the dreamy style. While Prince is a master at genre bending, Valente's attempts at it seem forced. She comes off more like an artist who lacks identity. As a solo effort I would give Elixer 2 stars.\n", "val": 0.044558849185705185}

{"text": "Prince, forever in demand for creative control, the guy has never heard the Rolling Stones anthem \" You Can't Always Get What You Want\" because Prince gets the deals (Target), gets the creative control (3 discs, 2 of him and 1 of his latest newcomer) and he gives it to you at a price you can't resist ($11.99). Besides his attitude problem, what won't this man do? Fail.LOTUSFLOW3R (1st) starts out like a sequel of PLANET EARTH, fueled with guitar rock (98% of this disc has guitar solos, some very wicked). Unlike PLANET EARTH, LOTUSFLOW3R gets interesting, with the except of the remaking of \"Crimson And Clover\". Prince hasn't been this rock heavy since PURPLE RAIN. All songs on this disc including the vocal-less \"77 Beverly Park\" will raise eyebrows, this guy has something to prove. Check out the monstrous \"Dreamer\".MPLSoUND (2nd disc) is where Prince (still solos on the guitar on some tracks) decides to smooth it out with R&B conceited \"(There'll Never B) Another Like Me\" ballads also like \"U're Gonna C Me\" and \"Better With Time\" and synth-rock \"No More Candy 4 U\" and the funk \"Ol' Skool Company\". MPL SoUND sound like the music was recorded over two decades ago. While LOTUSFLOW3R uses a drummer, the majority of MPLSoUND are programmed drum machines patterns like from the albums 1999, PURPLE RAIN & AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAY. Regardless, this is another winning disc.Now, ELIXR (3rd and final disc) has music and maybe all lyrics of Prince but sung by his latest discovery, Bria Valente. Prince is forever trying to put someone on. Remember Tamar? Prince's last discovery? \"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed\"? Where she go? Whatever.

{"text": "You know I didn't know if after Prince retired his \"royal badness\" persona and the parental advisories stopped appearing on his albums if his music would survive intact.

This set,only available through Target stores (at least at the moment) really showcases Prince's talent as an artist,bandleader and a producer on all of it. But he showcases all his talents individually as well by presenting three seperate CD's here:two by the man himself and one by a new female singer Bria Valente. So for starters what does Bria have to offer us on her debut 'Elixer'?Well on this Prince produced album the jazzy,high voiced Bria puts her vocals on top of a set of largely modern jazzy soul tunes,the best of which are the sensual \"Here Eye Come\",the breezy Brazillian styles of \"Everytime\" and the pumping retro disco-funk groove of \"2Nite\".Other cuts such as \"Another Boy\",\"Immersion\" and the title cut again find her in a jazzier frame of mind. Throughout the sound of Prince's rhythm guitar give no doubt where the music is coming from. As for the Prince albums the basic release is titled after his most anticipated part of this 'Lotusflow3r'.Where it's been hyped as Prince \"rock\" album,and it is in some sense there of course is so much more here then that. Recorded with a full band sound (I'd have to assume the same personel as the last two Prince albums) the psychedlicized wah-wah pumping and guitar gymnastics of \"Boom\",his cover of \"Crimson And Clover\",the hit \"Dreamer\" and the two part title song do find Prince rocking out with fine style and power for all the guitar heroes out there. On the other hand he also offers up plenty of surprises with the excellent \"Colonized Mind\",another great message from him about thinking for yourself. This album also thinks of the hard core funk fans with \"Feel Good,Feel Better,Feel Wonderful\",another great JB's style groove dedicated to the life affirming qualities of the funk. On \"$\" (meaning Money from the lyrics seemingly\" streches out a similar groove. Two of the most unconventional tracks are the like minded smooth groove of \"Love Like Jazz\" and the Italian flavored instrumental \"77 Beverly Park\",with Prince touching on a musical sound even he's never touched on in the past. He rounds the whole thing out with two ballads in \"4ever\" and \"Wall Of Berlin\". There wasn't a lot of talk about the other Prince offering here 'MPLSound' but there sure should be more because it's very important for Prince lovers to here. On this album Prince pulls out his talent as a one man band,blasting right back to his classic 80's sound (with a modern twist) as if he...well was follwing up an album like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sign-O-the-Times/dp/B000002LBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sign 'O' the Times</a>&nbsp;or something-it could even have been recorded entirely with the Revolution! It features one of Prince greatest 1,2,3 punches with the three jams \"(There'll Never B) Another Like Me\",the pounding \"Chocolate Box\" and \"Dance 4 Me\"-everything from the LINN drums,guitar and synths are right out front! The whole thing is personified with \"Ol' Skool Company\",a down and dirty jam that boils the whole thing down to a 21'st century Minneapolis sound,stating bluntly that new artists need to express themselves more creatively and should be able to get radio play in the doing,the concept Prince has preached (even symbolically) from the start. The whole \"new funk of many colors\" concept continues with two exciting,quirker jams like \"Here\" and the rollicking \"No More Candy 4 You\",another cut against \"fake\" music. Again there are ballads such as \"U're Gonna C Me\" and \"Valentina\" that again express the sensuality and mystique of classic Prince. Modern production touches a bit on the tingly \"Better With Time\" but still he's firmly in control of what he does. In the end Prince is here and there's no doubt he's still got it. I am no more sure then anyone what that \"it\" is but it's been getting our attention and funking us up for over three decades and,at least if this is the direction Prince is heading in the future it's sure looking to be a good one!

ThreeCD's for a very reasonable price. Two by Prince and one featuringBria Valente an excellant vocalist. Her CD is a sensual pleasure.It's GREAT to just close your eyes and enjoy the RICH instrumentals andSMOOTH vocals. I EXPECT to hear a lot more from Bria in the near future.Prince's CD's are just AMAZING...I LOVED the guitar work evident in both discs. I've always been VERY IMPRESSED with Prince as both a musicianand a very versatle songwriter. He doesn't Disappoint!My favorite cut is his cover of Crimson and Clover in which he throws inthe Troggs \"Wild Thing\" as well...a pleasing arrangement!Prince's own songs including Wall of Berlin are interesting listens.I couldn't help but think about the Revolution when I listened to the discs. I sincerely HOPE to see Prince in concert again! I thinkthe material from this set would be SPECIAL live!If you enjoy Prince's music and especially his forays into different styles,and appreciate his genius, you'll ENJOY this collection!\n", "val": 0.08591259270906448}

{"text": "NO this isn't Controversy, 1999, Purple Rain or any other album that I'm prepared to call a masterpiece. It's been a while but what I hear this time is real passion and I hear the genuine Prince Rogers Nelson...the musician and most underated guitarist of all time!!! This is a very guitar heavy effort and that's a key word, effort. I didn't feel any effort on Planet Earth...it's back and it's here Prince freaks!!! The arrangements, lyrics and overall musical effort is an A+ compared to Planet Earth. This is a coming of age for Prince and probably more of what he's like live in concert now...My personal Fav's here are as follows but not in order of preference; \"colonized mind\", \"Feel good, feel better, feel wonderful\" and on the 2nd Prince disc, there  is a more danceable feel but nothing really sticks out at me right now, maybe Valentina...I'm hoping it'll grow on me as I listen a few more times. My favorite cut from this CD is the remake of \"Crimson and Clover\"...Prince does a remake justice...I hear he does a lot of covers in concert now a days. I'm really glad that he stayed away from the voice box craze that is ruining music right now and went back to the Old School Minniapolis Music Sound...in closing Prince Freaks...if you are true to this monniker...buy this album, I feel that he made it 4 us...his true fans, the ones that love his efforts and see and hear what all the others won't hear or simply can't hear...this is a 3 stars+ effort from the purple one...a definate buy with a nice new voice in Bria Valente, whom i believe caqn sing a lot better than his past proteges...Taja Seville was cute, Appolonia & Vanity were sexy and finally Sheila E. is a very talented percussionist but Bria is striking and has some chops for the biz...again, a must have for the Freaks out there and a solid CD for newcomers to one of music's true royal figures.\n", "val": 0.012271315790712833}

I truly enjoy Bria Valente's 'Elixir', and I must say that she can sing, unlike the rest of Prince's proteges (sorry Sheila E., I still think you rock tho :0).  The other 2 albums Lotus Flow3r and MPLS Sound are just average.  There are a few good songs sprinkled here and there, but it's not Prince's best work.  These albums do however highlight how skilled Prince is on the guitar. This 3cd set is a steal for the price, so if you love Prince and his sound, buy it anyway.\n", "val": 0.00024289397697430104}

As is well documented, a lot of  Prince's releases in the past 15 years have had little critical acclaim, it's true he has had a lot of misses but look hard enough and they is so much fantastic stuff hidden away in-between some filler.Anyway, Lotusflow3r (a more guitar heavy album) starts with Filler before going into Boom, a nice guitar track but nothing special,  the next tracks though are good 4ever, Crimson and Clover (a cover), Colonized Mind all stand-outs (The Morning After is on the digital release - another nice song which reminds me of The Morning Papers from Symbol). The album follows the guitar / ballad style that Prince is so fond of and is well worth a listen.MPLSound (more funk Musicology style) is actually more consistent. They'll Never Be Another is a strong opener, the horrendous (well in my opinion) Chocolate Box follows but after that the album is quite strong apart from the final track - another confectionery song - maybe Prince should avoid that! A reworking of U're Gonna C Me from One Nite Alone Piano CD is welcome and adds to the song, Ol' Skool Company and Dance For Me are great funk songs. My favourite though is probably Valentina an exotic ballad aimed at Salma Hayek \"Hey Valentina - tell your mama she should give me a call, when she get tired of runnin' after you down the hall and she's all worn out from all those late night feedings and she's ready for another rock'n' roll meeting... Prince will never change - thank goodness!If you were to make once CD of this (I'm ignoring the Bria album altogether) you could make a contender for album of the year. Suffering the same fate as Emancipation some years ago, Prince has gone for quantity of quality in some instances, as a hardcore fan, I'm glad to get my grubby mitts on anything he does - but a 12 song single CD excluding the Lotus filler and the Confectionery fetish and we'd be looking at a classic.Now, Mr Nelson - isn't it time to release some of that vault on Lotusflow3r.com - I've still $65 worth of music owning ;)This in my opinion is the best thing Prince has done since The Rainbow Children (a vastly underrated album).

{"text": "Basically this cd is not good to me. I rank this cd with some of his worse efforts. The guitar playing is very good though and showcases itself perhaps more than any other Prince cd with consistent solos.  It is obvious Prince had an after party mentality for funk on this cd, but somehow he missed the mark.  It is not a horrible cd it just does not make you ever feel like dancing or caring to play that one song over and over.  Some of the guitar rifts are excellent though.Okay after two weeks of listening to the cd I can ease up a bit and say here are the best songs on the albums to me rated 1-10.Here- I give a number 7.  I really liked this song but it took a while to grow on me. It really wasn't till I listened to the lyrics clearly. I listened to this song more than any other.  It has a carousel feel to it sorta of like Dionne from The Truth Cd's but in lyrics it's more reminiscent to The Dance on 3121 and Strange Relationship from SOTT)Dance For Me-I give a number 6(Reminiscent of 319 off Gold but a little better b/c).  His voice sticks in your head and I like the beat. This is a good Prince song.U're Gonna C Me- I say it's a 9 but we've already heard this so I give it a 7.6.  (I have to lower the number for remixes b/c imagine anyone else redoing a song of their own and putting it on an album)Chocolate Box-I give a 5.  I would give a 6 but it sounds like it should be played in a gay bar and I'm a man so I can only dig it but so far. His voice sticks in your head with this song. If he came out with this in the 80's it woulda been a hit but it's 2009.Crimson and Clover-I give a 4 just because I can and if you're Prince and you're gonna do a cover song it has to be great, but that guitar rift bumps it up to a 5.$- I give a 5.  Definitely reminiscent of MovieStar off Crystal Ball.77 Beverly Park- I give an eight.  It's only an instrumental though, but it's probably the best song on the 2 cd's.Colonized Mind-I give a 4 compared to Money Don't Matter, SOTT,  When Will We Be Paid, Avalanche,Planet Earth, and his other political songs. He does have a couple lines in this song worth being heard though and the comparisons of a child with no mother equals a man with no feeling make you think.Overall this cd is okay.  Even with his funny electro voice it just didn't do it. Like everyone we all expect a lot out of Prince while at the same time trying to lower our expectations, but this cd is just okay.  I can think of too many of his other cd's that are far better but he does have a couple songs that are catchy.  He definitely caught a vibe on this cd, it's just I didn't catch it.  Like I said, it sounds like takes from an afterparty or a B-sides cd. It did not feel like an album.  By this I mean think Dave Chappelle's sketches compared to his stand up or a television show compared to a movie.  I feel like he wanted to be funky on this cd and it came across but it just wasn't stankonia.\n", "val": 0.007217089645564556}

Prince is back and he is awesome! His new protege, Bria Valente, has a smooth and sultry vibe that reminds me of Chante Moore and Sade combined.

{"text": "I have always liked Ari Hest's albums - moderately - they were OK.This one is different - VERY different - it includes songs from Hest's personal (self produced and published) project titled 52, in which he released a new song every week for a year. All songs on this album are his fans' choices of \"the best\" of that collection. And THE BEST they truly are - it's not too often that one can honestly say that there are NO weak songs here. This is such an incredible qualitative (and quantitative!) improvement over the previous albums - everything is somehow new, fresh, and sounds emotionally sincere; from technical point of view, all elements of this albums are close to perfection (or just perfect). Hest's songs are beautifully crafted, his voice is now more mature, and has impressive dynamic range; gentle back-vocals harmonies are used with restraint, and the record is outstandingly produced: even though it maintains a stylistic consistency, and to a certain degree his own \"signature\" sound, it's varied, and never gets boring, creating interesting soundscapes and arrangements on many songs. My personal favorites (although I like them all) are \"Cranberry Lake\" and rhythmically spectacular \"Binoculars.\"It's gutsy for a singer/author to go back to \"independent\" after recording for a major label. In this case, it seems it was a carefully planned, and well thought out decision, backed up with creativity, tenacity, hard work, and lots of talent. I hope it is a new start for Ari Hest, on his own terms: a beginning of a great career.\n", "val": 0.05413813889026642}

{"text": "The comments posted here are also being used to comment on other Tom Waits albums.The inner lives of the denizens of that late night diner in the famous painting by the American realist artist Edward Hopper, \"Nighthawks\" (1942). The scorching literary sketches of the rich and famous and the skid row bums provided by the late \"Gonzo\" journalist Doctor Hunter Thompson, accompanied by the renderings of the artist Ralph Steadman. The jingle-jangle high side lyrics of the legendary folk musician Bob Dylan of the \"Blood On The Tracks\" period. The reach into the far side of the part of the psyche exhibited by those down at the base of American society in an earlier period by the novelist Nelson Algren in \"Walk On The Wild Side\". And that same reach later by the man of the \"mean\" Los Angeles streets, Charles Bukowski. Wrap them all up in a whiskey-soaked, cigarette-scarred, gravelly, rasping voice and you have the idiosyncratic musician Tom Waits. Placed in that same company as above? Yes, by all means. Not a bad place to be, right?Although I have been listening to the music of one Tom Waits for decades, every since I heard Jerry Jeff Walker  do a cover of his classic song of  loneliness, longing and reaching for the elusive promise of Saturday night dreams in \"Looking For The Heart Of Saturday Night\",  I am not familiar with his biography. All I know is that aside from his own far-reaching musical endeavors, as expressed in numerous albums over the years, he has acted in some motion pictures, most notably as a skid row philosopher of sorts in the movie version of William Kennedy's \"Ironweed\" (a natural, right?) and has provided the soundtrack music to many movies, most notably the Al Pacino-starring \"Sea Of Love\". That Waits soundtrack version of the late 1950's, early 1960's classic teenage anthem to longing and love is just the right example of what Brother Waits means musically to this reviewer. Taking that simple song of teenage longing, Waits' husky-voiced rendition reaches back and turns it into something almost primordial, something that goes back beyond time to our first understandings that we are `alone' in the universe. Enough said.But so much for all of that because what I really want to mention is the \"Waits effect\". Every once in a while I `need' to listen to words and sounds that express the dark, misbegotten side of the human experience.  You know, sagas of Gun Street girls, guys talking \"Spanish in the halls', people lost out there on the edge of society and the like. Is there anyone today who can musically put it better? If you need to hear about hope, dope, the rope. Wine, women and song or no wine, no women or no song. About whiskey-caked barroom floors, floozies, boozies, flotsam, jetsam, stale motel rooms, cigarette-infested hotels, wrong gees, jokers, smokers and ten-cent croakers. Drifters, grifters, no good midnight sifters. Life on the fast lane, nowhere lane, some back street alley, perhaps, out in the valley. This, my friends is you address. Listen up. Professor Waits is at the lectern.Anthology Of Tom Waits, Tom Waits, Electra/Asylum Records, 1985This \"greatest hits\" compilation is just what it claims to be (circa 1985). If you need a Waits primer (and you should) you need to listen to the classic here. Tops on my list are \"Diamonds On My Windshield\", \"Tom Traubert's Blues\" and his incredible paen to deperate young love, evocative of the best of Dylan in \"Desolation Row\" and of some of Nelson Algren's short stories about love and longing down in the 'mean streets and back alleys', \"Jersey Girl\".

{"text": "When I downloaded and played these mp3 files, I thought they were okay. I am used to more repetitive and faster drumming.I did like the introductory call and the call back at the end. I thought them to be very creative. They set the stage very well. The intros did a good job of conjuring an experience of being in the dark, in a natural setting aware from cities and modern man, and in an eerie middle world of altered consciousness rich with potential.I thought of the sound as a sinuous rope with tassels at each end, the rope being the main drumming and the tassels the flourishes at the beginning and the end. It turns out that this is actual drumming, with no edited in loops to make the piece artificially monotonous. You can get electronically generated music for that. And, it turns out that actual, human-made drumming is a good thing.At first listen I thought the recordings were one channel mono. I was thinking of importing them into a sound editor and making them at least two tracks of the same info, just to hear in both ears. I'm glad I didn't.I listened to the recordings once when I was in a much deeper state of relaxation. I noticed that it was indeed in stereo, one side softer than the other, and combined they sounded as if they were on one side. But, there were subtleties in the stereo mix and it seemed the two played off each other.When I listened again when I was in a deeply relaxed the drumming really carried me away. Then the drumming sounded as if it it was deep inside, not at a distance as the first time I listened. What I thought was a liability, the slight changes in drumming rhythm, turned out to be endlessly fascinating. I heard a series of rhythms of different frequencies running throughout the drumming thread. Remember biorhythms? It was like that. The main rhythm was fundamentally a duality, but there were subtle undertones. My body enjoyed it and was eager to play along in rhythm. The play of consciousness was quite remarkable.I've come to believe that drumming is a unique and direct way to alter consciousness, quite different from breathing exercises or mantras. It's much more direct if experienced in the proper frame of mind.These mp3s are three different experiences. The 20 minute and 30 minutes ones are similar, but the 10 minute one stands apart. I like them all; each has something different to offer.Each time I listen to them, I find more in them. This album is a winner. I recommend getting all three so you can have the right length when you need it.\n", "val": 0.0009015221148729324}

{"text": "I was searching for some new drumming music for myself and some others who asked me about drumming music for shamanic journeys. I purchased 2 inexpensive downloads based on the samples at Amazon. This download and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Journeys-Drumming-for-Shamanic-Travel/dp/B004AYCYP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Journeys:  Drumming for Shamanic Travel</a>. This download offers 10, 20, and 30 minute journeys. Listen to the samples when selecting drumming for the shamanic journey as some may favor faster or slower beats, more instruments, different instruments, or simple drumming, we all have our own tastes and methods. Sometimes I use the didgeridoo. Once experienced the 20 minute track should be about right and the 10 minute for a short visit to the other world, but I do know some who need longer tracks. There are some attention getting sounds to start the journey and I liked the signal to travel out of ordinary reality as some drumming CDs don't really have a different sound to start the journey. The drum sounds has an interesting hollow sound, perhaps not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. The second 20 minute piece has rattles along with the drumming and I like the combo. I have several single and double drum journeying CDs and downloads and rattles alone so it was a welcome change to have some ratting and drumming for the journey. Overall I liked this download as it offered the options of different journey lengths and you can't beat the inexpensive price. I have been using this download now for sometime and it has become one of my reliable favorites. Recommended.2013 Update: I have collected a few other more traditional and new agey journey tracks and I still find myself using these tracks. I like the drum used to create these MP3s and the different journey lengths are still a plus. I also have come to love the didgeridoo and I sometimes find myself journeying on the sounds of crystal or tibetan bowls. To be honest I don't need the drum or any other instrument to journey anymore, I just like it.\n", "val": 0.007184117566794157}

{"text": "I first heard of Shovels and Rope through certain performances with The Lumineers, both live and in a co-performance on Austin City Limits.  Their charisma and power during their live performances is likewise present in their studio recordings.The first thing that will draw you in is the way their voices blend together.  Sometimes Michael takes lead.  Sometimes it's Cary Ann.  They supplement each other while the other one shines. Other times they sing together in harmony with the power of a full chorus.  I said this in my review of their album \"O'Be Joyful\" and I'll say it again: Cary Ann's voice is soaring and powerful... 'More Dolly and less Taylor, if you know what I mean.'  And it's so refreshing.If you lament the seemingly lost art of effective storytelling through songwriting, Shovels and Rope is your band.  What I appreciate is the honesty in their music and lyrics, the unabashed willingness to take on serious topics and do so artfully and tastefully through lyrical narrative and musical commentary.  \"Build Around Your Heart a Wall,\" \"Mother's Scorn\", and \"Swing Low\" are prime examples of their ability to engage a listener and feel what they do.  There are no euphemisms, no gimmicks, just honest, barebones songwriting.\"Swing Low\" is a stately songs, and I love how they take their time with this one.  The percussion imitates the sounds of march to an execution.  Never does the instrumentation or ostinato really change, but the buildup of intensity is achieved by their voices and the lyrics.  The organ droning on underneath it all provides that ominous atmosphere, an artistic choice that points to real artistry that I think will get Shovels and Rope more recognition.In fact, this first album is masterful in the way this husband-wife duo conveys moods.  Take, for example, the first tracks \"Gasoline\" and \"Boxcar\" with their upbeat tempos and chord progressions, juxtaposed with darker lyrics.This is an expertly done record with excellent songwriting, strong singing, and lyrics that pull you in and force you to think.  I think big things are coming for these two.\n", "val": 0.03170659765601158}

Overall, they're very interesting: country, it would seem at first, then maybe rockabilly with some definite straight rock and even bluesy tunes. I think they're still figuring out their sound and their main strength, but it's fun to watch them explore. They're a lot more classy than just a shovel and a rope.\n", "val": 0.035266511142253876}

{"text": "To recap from my review of O' Be Joyful (another great album by these two):I heard them first after The Lumineers on Austin City Limits. At first, I found myself wishing The Lumineers had closed the show, but then, it just clicked. I turned the volume up a bit. Trent absolutely wailed on guitar. Volume up a bit more. Their vocals clawed their way into my ears and then the harmony just blew me away. Leaned forward in my seat. Then I could tell they'd written the songs. Then they switched instruments. Volume up a bit more. Then I realized that they were doing it all--drums, harmonica, guitars, vocals, keyboards---I mean *all* of what I was hearing. It ended too soon, with me slack-jawed in front of my TV grabbing for my phone to head over to the Amazon mp3 store.Fell in love. Bought both albums and their solo efforts. Haven't had the slightest regret since. These two are the real deal folks. They write, they sing, they play, and they electrify a room.Highlights here:1) \"Boxcar\" for sure. Great story song.2) \"Mexico\" a haunting ballad.3) \"Magdelina\" not for the kids necessarily, but an amazing song. Complex, nuanced, raunchy, and ultimately real. And the harmonies are just gorgeous here.4) \"Hollowpoint Blues\" is raucous and a heckuva ride.The rest of the songs are all keepers as well, but these are the standouts. Buy it. Listen to it. Live with it. Then go see them live. You'll see what I mean.\n", "val": 0.012253465130925179}

Every song on this album has its way of ushering you deeper and deeper into the presence of God. Shana sings with authority and total freedom. Not only is her voice anointed, but it is clear that she is trained in leading people into worship to a place of total abandonment and surrender. I enjoy several songs particularly on this album, but the entire compilation as a whole is a blessing in itself. Another thing that I admire about her work is the prophetic flow that you experience while worshipping with Shana. There are some very spontaneous moments on this album that will truly capture your heart and provoke you to worship God with your whole heart, mind, spirit and soul.

{"text": "This album has some of their best bass playing/clean guitar work, simply put. From my understanding, the main criticisms were that anything thrash metal = COMPLETE METALLICA WORSHIP. That's simply absurd in this case, since there's still the best parts of their metalcore influences with quite a bit of their death metal influences. If I can blame the commercial failure of the album on anything, it's releasing Anthem as the single. However, the rest is so much better that it can just be entirely overlooked.There's a lot of layers across this, and I dare say that this is every bit as progressive as Shogun at times. the acoustic guitar outro of Ignition being used as a transition to the final chorus. The bass solos in the truly climactic instrumental title track and Becoming the Dragon are awesomely Iron Maiden. The basslines range from chunky lows for the guitars to play on top of to being the lead instrument, and they really tie this together more than anything on earlier releases to me. I highly recommend using an EQ to bring the bass out on this one!This album can also be seen as a concept album of sorts, dealing with societal corruptions and having hope within the cynicism. Even if the lyrics get hyper-specific at times, even those flaws become charming just from the sheer passion on this, and tracks like Ignition, To the Rats and Becoming the Dragon are amazing lyrically without the specificities.The last area to cover would be the guitar work, and it's all over the place. You have unconventional solos, sweeps, awesomely phrased rhythms, tempo dynamics...it all comes together so beautifully. There's cleans for the transitions, but the whole album feels like Evile grade thrash revival at its highlights. The influences are obvious, and they take after the best and merge them to make something beautiful. Of particular note is COntempt Breeds Contamination; The intro is so technical that I was actually reminded of Allegaeon's rhythms!This is easily one of the greatest diamonds in the rough I've ever heard regarding fan reception, and I strongly urge fans of thrash metal and death metal to give it a shot.\n", "val": 0.013458382338285446}

{"text": "The Crusade is perhaps the most notorious of Trivium's catalog thanks to the mixed reception it received upon its release. Back in in 2006 when it was released, fans were divided on the album mainly because it was quite a departure from the sound of their previous two albums. Namely, this album is essentially devoid of screams / growls whereas the previous two albums featured a mix of clean and harsh vocals. In addition, this album is more purely rooted in thrash metal than the previous two. While the previous two albums contained very strong thrash metal influences, the presence of harsh vocals and occasional breakdowns led fans to refer to them as metalcore.I find this negative reaction to The Crusade to be invalid mainly for two reasons: (1) I myself do not consider Trivium's first two releases to be metalcore; they are metal, or otherwise a more modern interpretation of thrash metal. The Crusade represents a different shade of thrash metal: the kind that is more deeply rooted in the classic '80s aesthetic. Even Matt Heafy (vocalist/guitarist for the band) himself rejected the metalcore label early in the band's career when he said, \"Metalcore is a combination of metal and hardcore, and we've never been into hardcore. We don't draw any influence from that scene. Even our second record, 'Ascendancy', was a metal record. Sure, it had screaming and heavy/soft parts. But only a small number of people would consider it metalcore.\"Second, the initial negative reception is, for the vast majority, reflecting on a change in sound as I explained in detail above. A change in the style of music is not the same as a change in QUALITY of music. Because of this disparity, this negative reception lacks objectivity.Having only gotten into Trivium in the last year, I can say that my immediate, unbiased reaction to my first spin of The Crusade was that it was an amazing thrash metal album that calls upon elements from the metal bands of the '80s that Trivium are fans of. Sure, it sounds DIFFERENT from the previous two albums, but at this point in their career, Trivium is six albums into their career, and ALL of the albums sound different from each other. The Crusade fits into their discography perfectly as one of the many patches on the growing tapestry that is the collection of unique sounds each of their albums have.There is an incredible amount of variation across all of the songs on this album, yet they all seem to mesh without sounding like an unfocused mix of ideas that are diverse just for the sake of being diverse. It is clear that the band members were improving dramatically in their musical abilities, with most members being around 20 when this album was released. The guitar leads are the most technical up to this point, and may even be the most technical of their career aside from the legendary Shogun. Paolo's bass sound on this album is very clear (something that is often hard to come by with modern day metal production values) and his parts often go much deeper than simply mirroring the rhythm guitar (check out the bonus track \"Broken One\" to hear the epitome of this). The rhythm guitar is nothing to shun either; thrash metal is known for having aggressive, rhythmic riffs that are often just as challenging and fun to play as the leads are (check out the rhythm guitar part during the second guitar solo in \"Detonation\"). The drumming is the clearest indicator of how the standards for thrash (and metal in general) have been raised over time as bands are accomplishing more musically earlier in their careers. Travis keeps it fresh by providing listeners with breakneck speeds with all of the bells and whistles attached as opposed to just playing speedy for the sake of speed, as well as more tasteful grooves that always go beyond playing the role of team metronome. And yes of course, the vocals are different. Are they bad? Hell no! Sure, on this album Heafy often sounds a lot like James Hetfield did during the '80s, but nowadays everyone complains that Hetfield doesn't sound enough like his 1980s self, so shouldn't Heafy's performance be welcomed? The vocals may be less varied since they lack the scream/growl vs. cleans dynamic, but this album shows Heafy wielding a more versatile and polished clean singing voice that he previously didn't possess. My only beef with this album is that some songs have a certain \"cheesy\" element (see \"Anthem\" and \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\") and the lyrics on \"To the Rats\" are absurdly juvenile and almost ruin an otherwise killer thrash track.\n", "val": 0.0017913338961079717}
{"text": "Trivium is a band that has so much to offer for the metal community; technicality, energy, and a willingness to be different! This band may not be demonstrating the differentness quite as much on this album, however, the technicality and energy are through the roof! Heafy's vocals are awesome, Smith's drumming offers quite a blast, and Corey's guitars just rock! Paolo's bass really evens out the sound and gives the already dark music a rich undertone.The Music-1. Ignition- Blasting off, wasting no time, the band makes its presence known! This sounds like it could've come straight off of a Metallica album. However, Trivium has something that Metallica doesn't have; musicality! I love metal, but I'm sorry, I don't believe that Metallica is that great. Trivium, however, pulls it off because they have melody, dynamics, a far superior vocalist, and 2 much better guitar players. Sorry Kirk, Corey will always be better at soloing that you have ever been. This song is a typical Thrash anthem, but I really like it! The music has a modern twist added to an 80's sound and it really is an awesome sound! Great opener!2. Detonation- Right where Ignition ends, Detonation begins. This one sounds even more thrashy than the opener. The riffing is thick, dark, and in a triplet feel. The drumming is heavy and interesting. Heafy's vocals sound absolutely amazing and then he does his signature bark/growl to say Detonation. This song is very dark, but it's by far my favorite on this album. Corey's solo is very unapologetic and in your face. I love it! Then, however, the reason this my favorite song; There is a transition in the middle to an Iron Maiden style riff/sound with a more upbeat and hopeful kind of sound while still rocking out and I love transitions like that! The solos in the upbeat part are much more musical than the previous one in the song, but all the solos in this song are appropriate for the backing music. I usually don't like notes at 10000 mph, but this song called for it in the beginning solo. VERY WELL DONE SONG! Awesome!3. Entrance of the Conflagration- This song is very thrashy and it's good, but it's not one that I listen to often. It's wedged in between the two best songs on the album and I just don't care much for it. I'm not much of a Thrash metal fan anyway and this song is all thrash and doesn't have the other Trivium elements like most of the other songs on here. It's not too bad though.4. Anthem (We Are the Fire)- Ok, just from the opening riff, it is BLATANT that this song was chosen to be the single. The opening riff is instantly infectiously catchy and makes the listener want to rock out! I LOVE the riff! One of the best riffs of the album and pretty technical as well! I keep trying to learn it on my guitar and I just can't play it! This song is definitely a well chosen single because it's actually a very good song that I can call a favorite. Sometimes, especially on metal records, the singles are the weakest songs on the album, but this is a very good choice song! The solo is aggressive and melodic and musical and the lyrics aren't very meaningful, but this is more of a party thrash anthem (hence the title) and I'm ok with it! I love to listen to this song at parties or whenever I'm just in a happy mood! Very good song, Great riffs!5. Unrepentant- This song takes things back in a dark direction, especially lyrically. I really like this song! Lyrically I find it similar to track 3, but I really enjoy the music on this song more than track 3. This song features an abundance of melodies, solid riffs, and exemplary metal vocals! Vocally, I think this is a very strong cut because Heafy goes back and forth from the Hetfield vocals and his usual cleans that we're used to and I love the dynamics of that! He has a very good voice and here he's utilizing it very well. The drumming on this song is pretty back seat, but it's far from bad. The solo on this one is also great! Great song!6. And Sadness Will Sear- This song is the first of a handful of tracks in a row that I felt were either ok and/or just shouldn't have made the album. I vote that this one should've been left off the album. I don't care much for it. I can't really put my finger on it, but I just feel that this is a very weak song.7. Becoming the Dragon- This song, much like track 3, is a solid cut, but it doesn't appeal to my taste. I can't deny that the band puts on a good performance in this song. The vocals on this song are pulled off very well and the drumming is very upfront on it and the guitars mix with the drums very well! I think this song has the potential to grow on me, but I feel that the instrumental part at the end isn't special enough to be as long as it is considering it's the same thing looped for a while basically. Strong cut, but I feel they could've made it a little shorter or at least made the ending instrumental part more interesting.8. To the Rats- I understand that this is a single, but I'm not a fan of it. The speed of it is awesome and the music behind it isn't that bad, but I feel that the intensity of the verse/intro is awesome, but the chorus, while melodic, doesn't match it. It's catchy, but the chorus just doesn't match it to my ears. I think it's a middle of the road song. Neither good, nor bad.9. This World Can't Tear Us Apart- This is more of a ballad sort of. It is at least a more uplifting song, but the verses are still fast and jam packed with riffs, but the chorus sounds like a ballad. The lyrics even point to that direction. I think the song is very good. It works as a good metal ballad. The solo is very melodic but it doesn't have enough tone and breath to it. It's very fast and just leaves as quickly as it began. I don't like that, but the song overall is very good! Awesome!10. Tread the Floods- This has an intro almost as epic as track 4! I love this song's intro and I'd have to say it's the 3rd best song on the album! It's very heavy, melodic and filled some very nice guitar/drum work. This is one that the bass really fills out the balance! It gives the song some edge. This is a very headbang worthy song and the chorus is very catchy vocal and guitar wise. After the first chorus, the song changes gears and goes into one of Trivium's best guitar solo sections (few, if any can top A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation, though). This is a very good song, Should've been a single!11. Contempt Breeds Contamination- I quite like this song too! Very heavy, very interesting subject matter to me, and I love the riffing of the two guitar axemen! Heafy's vocals definitely are great, especially on this song! The lyrics on this one are a little awkward to sing along to, but it's metal. You usually don't sing along. Unless you're me that is. But I still don't sing along to this one just because of the awkward phrasing.12. The Rising- This song's music isn't that bad, but the lyrics are kind of party mode like track 4, but it just doesn't work with the music that the lyrics are paired with. I could see this song if the music was a little more peppy, but it sounds a little bit down to me. I mean, I like party lyrics, but with music like this, I'd expect some more serious lyrics. Not a bad song though, but not one I'd listen to.13. The Crusade- This instrumental is a monster lasting 8 minutes long. This led to the longer songs on '08's Shogun. The riffing on here is very peppy, very heavy, and very technical. However, as far as instrumentals go, I don't really listen to them often. I do like that this one changes up quite a bit and sounds like possibly time signature changes. Very good and impressive instrumental. This is a step in a more technical direction for the band and it paid off because Shogun is their best album (that I've heard so far).Verdict- buy it. End of story. Trivum makes good albums anyway, but they are one of the most consistently good metal bands I've heard, especially when it comes to keeping things fresh and interesting on each album! This is worth it even more if you are a thrash metal fan! Great album! I highly recommend this and Shogun!Happy Shopping!\n", "val": 0.01967327482998371}

{"text": "Trivium's third studio album The Crusade may have divided fan opinion when it was released due to the band moving away from metal core influences and relying more heavily on their thrash metal influences.Without the screaming vocals, and with much more frequent dual guitar leads the album was different from what fans had been expecting. These days however, The Crusade fits perfectly into the Trivium catalogue thanks to their newer music combining the two styles, and thanks to the passage of time, along with the mixture of this material with the older stuff at Trivium concerts revealing to many quick-to-dismissal fans that the changes which the band had made for The Crusade weren't actually as extreme as people thought at the time.The Crusade features many great songs, many of which the band still keep in their live set to this day, from `Entrance of the Conflagration,' and `Unrepentant,' to the omni-present single `Anthem (We Are The Fire)'The musicianship is of a very high quality, copious guitar solos, thrash tinged riffs and interesting drum fills make for an interesting listen, while the production is of the highest standard, making the album sound fantastic.Highlights include the ferocious `Becoming The Dragon,' the slow and brooding `And Sadness Will Sear,' and the eight minute instrumental title tack.To Summarise, don't be put off by talk of this album not being heavy enough or any talk of selling out, The Crusade is a well written, enjoyable record that is unquestionably worth a chance.\n", "val": 0.06145486235618591}
{"text": "This is actually the first Trivium album I got, a little over two years ago. Since then, I've listened to this album countless times. In fact, the first time I listened to it was all the way through, it was so good and able to keep my interest throughout. Although Trivium's first two albums are more associated with the metalcore sound, \"The Crusade\" takes them into a pure thrash-metal direction. Blistering guitar solos, bludgeoning riffs, breakneck drumming, meter-pushing tempos, skilled songwriting and aggressive vocals dominate the album throughout; however, I would also like to point out that there are indeed some very beautiful melodic sections and larger-than-life sounding elements incorporated, making this more than just another thrash album.I could end right there and just tell you to go out and get the album already, but that would be an injustice on my part. \"The Crusade\" is one of the best metal albums of this decade in my opinion, and let me explain in the rest of my review.We kick off with \"Ignition\", a fast and angry song about the corruption of the government and its pointless obsession with the horrors of war and violence. Going from a speed-metal verse to a softer, more mournful sounding chorus, this song has a nice contrast to it. The ending guitar drone then brings us into \"Detonation\", which, by the the title alone, is a sequel to the first song. This song has one of the most intense sections on the entire album, with some insane guitar soloing over some of the most brutal double-bass drumming, almost taking the band to a death metal sort of sound, but not quite. A sad and yet gorgeous second half of the song rings out with slower verses and huge-sounding guitar sweeps, making yet another nice contrast in sounds.\"Entrance of the Conflagration\" is a moshpit-ready headbanger with some catchy-as-ever riffs, a complex mid-section and more great solos; this is one of my favorite songs on the album. \"Anthem (We Are The Fire)\" is right up there, too, with uplifting lyrics, amazing guitar solos and a shout-a-long chant after the solo section. This is truly an anthem! Even though it has just as much energy as the previous song, \"Unrepentant\" brings us back to the darker side, with lyrics about a true-life crime, just as in \"Entrace of the Conflagration\", the same which can be said for the next song, \"And Sadness Will Sear\".Taking things to a more fantasy-based nature, \"Becoming The Dragon\" combines more huge-sounding melodies with pure thrash-metal energy and a generally good vibe. Galloping riffs and some frantic solos are featured, along with, surprisingly, a bass solo! Paolo lets his bass ring out some interesting notes and phrases as the song fades out on a slow and interesting note. \"To The Rats\" is another truly awesome, three-and-a-half minute burst of energy, this one also almost treading into death-metal territory with its breakneck speed. However, a cool change is thrown in with the shout-a-long chorus, slowed down for good measures. \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" is a beautiful slow-dance styled song with some great melodies and sometimes-straightforward, sometimes-enigmatic lyrics. This song offers a nice change of pace, and is done in just three-and-a-half minutes.\"Tread The Floods\" has a sick intro with a great buildup until the chorus, which is one of the most empowering and catchiest choruses on the entire album, and the way it's sung at the end of the song ends it perfectly. \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\" is the fourth song based on a true-life crime, and this is another song that utilizes the low B-string, making it a heavy number indeed. The soloing also adds to the power, this time being spread out instead of one solo after another such as in \"Anthem (We Are The Fire\").\"The Rising\" seems to be a rather underrated song, although it's honestly just as good as any other song on the album. A slower, more majestic pace is featured here in addition to another great shout-a-long chorus. Finally, the album ends with the eight-and-a-half minute instrumental epic title track, \"The Crusade\". An awesome way to end the album and a great song just in general, you can tell the band put a lot of effort into writing this instrumental masterpiece.Comparatively, \"The Crusade\" is indeed, different from \"Ascendancy\", going in a thrash-metal direction and having more three-and-a-half minute songs for the most part, instead of the generally longer songs on \"Ascendancy\". Even though the two albums are different, \"The Crusade\" comes highly recommended to Trivium fans, as it shows the band at the top of their game and maturing as musicians and songwriters. Well, that about wraps up this review. In short, \"The Crusade\" is an album that keeps metal alive today, regardless of the scene. Get this and Trivium's newest album \"Shogun\" if you don't have that already, and I guarantee you'll be happy. Thanks for the time, and peace.\n", "val": 0.04767946898937225}
{"text": "As a heavy metal fan, especially of BRUTAL material (thrash, death, classic etc.) past and present, I never liked 'metalcore' and never will. Trivium's first two albums were not too bad (rather unique in fact) because they incorporated clean harmonies alongside the 'metalcore shouting', which I still thought was a little 'different' and refreshing than all the other sound-alike 'core' vocals out there. This album, on which every track is an absolute gem, is solid and heavy, yet complex and really does away with the metalcore vocals, and I love this band all the more for it. Yes Matt Heafy does sound a lot (eerily so) like James Hetfield of Metallica's 80's era! which is cool and a good nostalgic flashback to 80's Metallica vocal-wise. Instrumentally, however the music goes way beyond anything Metallica did in that period and is far more polished, colorful, technically sharp and of course heavy!. I do hope this band continues in this direction. They definitely kick ass both in terms of heaviness and musicianship.\n", "val": 0.08170600980520248}

{"text": "First off I want to say that I am new to Trivium but I have heard all four of their albums. The crusade is by far their best one. This album should not and can not be compared to their others. Why? This is a different sounding album for the better. Some people are comparing this album to Metallica and saying it sounds too much like them so they don't like it. That makes no sense. If you like Metallica you should like anything that sounds like them. It does sound like Metallica but that's why it's so good. This is the album I've been wishing Metallica would make.Here is a list of the songs1) Ignition - nice start to the album. (8/10)2) Detonation - starts off heavy but takes the song in a surprising direction. (9/10)3) Entrance of the Conflagration - cool song (9/10)4) Anthem (We are the Fire) - one of the best song on the album. This is the song which I first heard from Trivium and from the first listen I was a fan. If you don't like this song, you don't like Trivium. (10/10)5) Unrepentant - great song. (9/10)6 The Sandness will Sear - Nice song which is starting to build the album up as it reachs halfway. (8/10)7) Becoming the Dragon - My least prefered song on the album. Partly because they have put some screaming in and it sounds out of place on this album. (6/10)8) To the Rats - this song kicks ass and pulls the album up and gets ready for what's to come. (8/10)9) This World Can't Tear Us Apart - this song is so cool it's hard to put into words. (10/10)10) Tread the Floods - the opening riff to this song is one of the best I've heard (10/10)11) Contempt Breeds Contamination - anothers cool song (10/10)12) The Rising - second song I heard from Trivium and confirmed this band as one of the best there is. (10/10)13) The Crusade - an instrimental that starts to get a little thin about halfway through but a decent closing to the album (7/10)For anyone who likes Rock, this is the album you must own.\n", "val": 0.01585233025252819}

{"text": "Trivium are among the shining stars of newer metal outfits - i.e., those who were infants when Metallica's \"Master Of Puppets\" was released.  So rather than slag the band for their obvious homage to a band that was, at one time, the best metal band out there, one can understand how influence works.  After all, this reviewer, who is the crusty old age of 47 now (AIIEEEEEEE) was a teenager when KISS was on top of the heap and Zeppelin still had three more albums to release before their first breakup.  The influence these bands had on guitarists my age is incalculable and unavoidable.  For example, while I love Eddie Van Halen's searing work on the first five VH albums, one may hear more of a Frehley or Hendrix influence in my playing, ala the blues and more melodic soloing.  For the record, I saw Metallica open for Raven in a dingy bar across the Arkansas River from Fort Smith on their first U.S. club tour.  We had no idea who they were, or that they even had a record out, which at that time was \"Kill 'Em All\" on Megaforce, with \"Ride The Lightning\" soon to follow.  We thought at the time they were a good blend of punk ferocity and metal chops, which I still think is accurate to this day when we discuss \"Kill 'Em All.\"  Which brings us to Trivium, who could easily be my own kids.  I gave \"Ascendency\" a good review on these pages, but I deferred the fifth star because of the uneven vocal approach - gutteral roaring and mewing harmony backgrounds.  \"The Crusade\" is the result of a band that truly is heads above most of their peers, both skill-wise and intelligence-wise.  The vocals are eerily similiar to a young James Hetfield, but most of the album has gruff harmonies throughout and the best part, no grunting.  I hear some similarities musically to their mentors, but Trivium have a great thrash style of their own that has a tad of progressivism that Metallica didn't.  It isn't much, and that's good because I hate progrock, but also gives them the needed twist to keep them from being relegated to a copy band status.  \"The Crusade\" rocks mightily, the guitar work is astounding, and I really like the title instrumental track that showcases their chops.  I expect great things from this band, and hope they don't succumb to the drek Metallica came out with after \"And Justice For All\", which, for a major album, is the worst sounding CD in metal history.\n", "val": 0.024851057678461075}

{"text": "Trivium is a new favorite speed metal/thrash band of mine.  They are bringing intricate guitar solos back into modern heavy metal music, much to the everlasting joy of metal fans like me, who are tiring of the repetitive guitar \"riffing\" of most modern nu-metal-influenced bands. These guys play fast and complex and are good at it.Their first two albums are fantastic, especially their sophomore effort\"Ascendancy\", but to be honest, I was a bit concerned about buying their new one. I had read some disturbing internet rumors about it being a transparent Metallica rip-off. And then the first song was released on their MySpace page, called \"Detonation,\" and I was not terribly thrilled with it. It sounded like they were trying too hard to sound like early Metallica, which is a noble thing to attempt, but I just wasn't into it. I'm not into early Metallica at all, really.  But I bought it anyway, cause I had to hear it for myself and I chose to support the band by purchasing the album instead of just downloading it. And at first, I was pretty worried.The first track is called \"Ignition\" and sounds a lot like the second track, the aforementioned \"Detonation.\" They aren't bad songs, per se, but they seemed a bit too old-school for a band that I felt was the beginning of the new age of speed metal. The guitar work was brilliant as ever, but the tone of the music just did not click.One thing I did kind of like was the fact that the lead singer, Matt Heafy, was actually singing this time around. Their first two albums were full of angsty, unintelligible screaming for the most part. And while I have no problem with that, there are times when I actually like to understand what the lead singer is saying. But he doesn't scream barely at all this album, which is a bummer cause he was a good screamer. And other reviewers have mentioned the apparent similarity between Heafy's voice and the singing voice of one James Hetfield. This only fueled the \"Metallica rip-off\" claims more.The third track, \"Entrance Of The Conflagration,\" was the first one to really pick up my interest. It's a bit heavier than the first two, and without the more obvious Metallica influence. But it's the lyrics that really got me, which were helped by Heafy's clear singing.\"Forcing her own blood down / Beneath the water to drown / Lying dead with eyes wide open\"Like most metal bands, Trivium's lyrics took a back seat to the music on their first two albums. Their lyrics were better than some, but nothing really special, dealing with the common themes of depression, betrayal, angst, and death. But this was the first song that was clearly about something specific. Afterward, I learned that the song is about Andrea Yates, the woman who drowned her five young children in a bathtub. That's serious, right there.The next song is \"Anthem (We Are The Fire),\" which I liked because of its song-along chorus and positive vibe. By this point, I was warming to the album after its ho-hum first two tracks.Track five is the song \"Unrepentant,\" which grabbed me again because of its very specific lyrics. Like \"Entrance of the Conflagration,\" it was a song about a brutal real-life murder, this time about a Pakistani man named Nazir Ahmad who murdered his four daughters in an honor killing.The next song is \"And Sadness Will Sear\", which is quite simply the most powerful song Trivium has ever done. It is about the murder of Matthew Shepard, the gay man in Wyoming who was brutally beaten, tied to a fence in a field, and left to die. Heafy sings the verses in a soft, subdued voice and cries out the chorus very passionately. The guitar work is not a prominent in this song, limited to the short solo and song's finale, but the lyrics are sorrowful and heartfelt.\"Tied to the fence as they break you / And sadness will sear / Cold is the wind that will freeze you / And sadness will sear / It's 12:53 AM when the scarecrow died / A victim of society's cruelty / It's 12:53 AM when the shepherd died\"Track seven is \"Becoming The Dragon\", a fast and heavy rocker to pick up the pace after the somber \"And Sadness Will Sear.\" It's got a great song-along chorus and a unique solo near the end of the song.\"To The Rats\" is the next song, one of the fastest on the album so far. The lyrics are forgettable, but the guitar work once more is fast and relentless. And it marks the sixth song in a row that doesn't sound like Metallica. One more odd thing about this track is that they swear a few times, and Trivium doesn't really swear that much.\"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" is next, and if you can't tell from the title, this is the closest Trivium gets to an actual love song on any of their albums. It's not a slow song by any rate, with some great soloing, but the lyrics at times do get a little cheesy. A cheesy love song is okay though if you don't listen to the words so much.Track number ten is the song \"Tread The Floods\", which should totally be released as a single. It's the best straightforward song on the album, fast and complex music with catchy lyrics, and almost impossible not to headbang to.\"Tread the floods so you can hope to seize / Your own reality before it escapes thee / Watch yourself drown in disarray / It's time to break away or we'll die today\"  I know those aren't the best lyrics in the world. Nobody uses the word \"thee\" anymore. But the initial guitar solo and the longer solo in the middle of the song are totally awesome.The next track is the awkwardly-titled \"Contempt Breeds Contamination,\" which sounds like something off a Hatebreed album. The song itself is another tale of brutality and murder, this time the death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man shot to death by New York police officers.\"The blood is on your hands / Hands which were supposed to protectPeople like the man you blew away / This isn't justice, this is corruptionThe four protectors fired 41 shots / Hitting him 19 times / Searching the body, there were no weapons found / He lies with all who died in vain.\"The twelfth track is \"The Rising,\" one of the coolest songs Trivium has done to date. It's got a groovy beat and sounds like a hand-clapping arena rocker from someone like Bruce Springsteen. Oddly enough, this song demonstrates Trivium's talent, because it's unlike anything they have done so far. And it's got another rocking chorus:\"So raise your voices with me / And sing this song of unity / So raise your hands up with me / And hold this moment eternally\"The last song, aptly titled \"The Crusade\" is the song all speed metal freaks wait for. It's an eight-minute long instrumental. Trivium, if memory serves, has never done a real instrumental before, and this raging, adrenaline-fueled piece of metal mastery is one of the best I've heard in years.So it turns out my worries were unfounded. In my opinion, the two weakest songs on the album were the first two tracks, and the rest of the album is just completely awesome. Definitely Trivium's best, and one of the best metal albums released this year. Those who claim it's a Metallica rip-off probably stopped listening after the first two songs, which I can't really blame them for, cause I was tempted to. But some of the songs are just unbelievable, in particular \"Entrance Of The Conflagration,\" \"And Sadness Will Sear,\" \"Tread The Floods,\" and \"The Rising.\"\n", "val": 0.0005655134445987642}

There are other issues that I could've dealt with, like the singing change, etc. But as much as I try to like this album, I can't get over the fact that it sounds increadibly like a lot of my other, older metal albums.

{"text": "The way I see it, Trivium's new album \"The Crusade\" is an awesome follow up to their 2005 effort \"Ascendancy\" which was a darn good album, but this album in my eyes is a whole lot better and it's their best album thus far, and it's also one of my all time favorite metal albums of 2006 (Slayer's \"Christ Illusion\" holds the title for my favorite and best metal album of 2006 though). I remember hearing the song \"Ignition\" on my Music Choice Metal station (channel 310) prior to the album's release, and after hearing it, I knew I had to get the album, and I don't even regret buying it whatsover. Yeah I know this album has recieved some mixed reviews on here, due to the change of direction the band went with this album, I acutally believe they changed for the better on this album. My point is if some people don't like this album, that's just fine with me. I'm a good sport about it, and I respect other people's opinions as long as nobody disses each other's opinions. While Trivium's past realeaes were mostly metalcore, \"The Crusade in my mind borderlines thrash metal. On \"The Crusade\", vocalist/guitarist Matt Heafy has abandoned his harsh metalcore esque screams (which I'm glad he did) in favor of low agressive clean singing vocals which bring Metallica's James Hetfield (\"And Justice For All\" era) to my mind. I actually find his singing vocals very good on here. This album also is just loaded with great guitar riffs and awesome blazing solos from Matt and second guitarist Corey Beaulieu whom are both awesome on the axes. You also have great hearable bass lines from Paolo Gregoletto, and great drumming from Travis Smith. The album opener \"Ignition\" is a great fast, addicting, track and it's my favorite song on the album bar none. This song also brings vintage Megadeth and Metallica to my mind especially in the chorus, and the solo by Matt is awesome as well. Lyrically this song reflects society as it is today. \"Detonation\" is another great thrasher with five solos (three from Corey and two from Matt). Another one of my favorites on here. \"Anthem (We Are the Fire)\" brings Iron Maiden (another one of my favorite bands) to mind especially the guitarwork for instance. You just gotta love the line in that song: \"The Music Connects, Unites Us More\". We also have a great catchy ballad \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" which is another one of my favorites. Some other songs on here are also about famous killings. For example: Track three \"Entrance of the Conflagration\" is about Andrea Yates's murder of her five children in which she drowned all of them one by one in a bathtub, because she believed that they were all possessed. Track five \"Unrepentant\" is about Nazir Ahmad's murder of his three daughters and one stepdaughter (I believe it was Ahmad's stepdaughter who committed adultery), track six \"And Sadness Will Sear\" is based upon the murder of Matthew Shepard, and track eleven \"Contempt Breeds Cotamination\" is about the death of Amadou Diallo who took 19 bullets out of 41 gunshots. The 8+ minute closing instrumental \"The Crusade\" is in my eyes the crowning jewel of the entire album. Five awesome solos are included on the track including a killer bass solo from Paolo. While not as great as Metallica's \"The Call of Ktulu\" off 1984's \"Ride The Lightning\", but it's great nonetheless. Please read on for the songs and the ratings.Jeremy's song ratings:1. Ignition (3:54) - 5/5 (My favorite song and very addicting too)2. Detonation (4:28) - 5/53. Entrance of the Conflagration (4:35) - 5/54. Anthem (We Are the Fire) (4:03) - 5/55. Unrepentant (4:51) 5/56. And Sadness Will Sear (3:34) - 5/57. Becoming the Dragon (4:43) - 5/58. To the Rats (3:42) - 5/59. This World Can't Tear Us Apart (3:30) - 5/510. Tread the Floods (3:33) - 5/511. Contempt Breeds Contamination (4:28) - 5/512. The Rising (3:45) - 5/513. The Crusade (8:19) - 5/5 (Great instrumental)Bottom Line: Some people will like this album, some people won't like it, and if they don't, that's fine with me, I've got no control over other people's decisions. Like I said before this album is Trivium's best thus far and also one of the best metal albums of 2006 although Slayer's \"Christ Illusion\" holds the title for best metal album of 2006 in my mind. So if you're a fan of Trivium, heavy metal, thrash metal, or just good music in general, by all means you must own this album. Enjoy!!\n", "val": 0.06984975934028625}

As for me, the points in the album where they go into corny sounding harmonies or the acapella introduction to track 3, I just about hurl.  Also, they seem to cram 3-5 different songs into some tracks, as if each member of the band wrote their own movement, it worked better on ...And Justice for All.  It makes for interesting listening as you weave between thrash and corny rock.  We are the Fire is catchy if you like that sort of thing, but it's not my cup of tea.

And while I'm not apposed to that style of singing, the new approach of singing the songs with attitude and force really seem to fit Trivium much better. Again if you like old Megadeth, the lyrical style here will suit you just fine.All and all, The Crusade is pretty damn solid in my opinion.

{"text": "First off, I cut my teeth on bands like Megadeth, Testament, Exodus, King Diamond and such, and upon hearing this album I was blown away that they have revived this sound! I first was turned on to Trivium a couple years back with Ascendancy and was immidiately drawn to the obvious old-school metal guitar sound they had. Though Matt's growls sounded very dry and boring, the music on that album was impressive. The Crusade is leaps and bounds ahead of thier last album! Matts new vocal style fits him and the music so much better, and I really don't get the Hetfield comparisons. I only hear minor influences. Even at 20 years old Matt has better vocal range and sound than James has had on ANY recording!The guitar work on this album is amazing, they ditched the D-tuning and are playing METAL to the fullest. The riffs are very reminiscent of Megadeth, Mercyful Fate and Testment and it was so refreshing to hear solo's again! Great work! In an age where Metalcore bands are cloning left and right(without much variety), its nice to hear something like this.Back to the Metallica comparisons........This album is no Metallica clone, they have a style all thier own though thier influence of 80's Thrash and Speed Metal is prevalent, it is in no way a straight copy of anyones sound. And really, when was the last time Metallica sounded like Metallica???? 1988, I think. Thank the dark lord that Pantera came along to rule the Metal throne while Metallica chased radio singles and wrote juvenile butt rock songs like \"The House That Jack Built\" and \"2x4\".The Crusade is one of the best Metal realeses of 2006 and I would highly recommend it to old-school Speed/Thrash metal fans.If you are expecting another D-tuned album with cookie-cutter growls then pass on this one.What the Trivium boys have accomplished with this album is pure metal bliss and if they continue with this sound they could easily be the next Pantera.\n", "val": 0.04794325679540634}

{"text": "Trivium's third release tries to do many things.  It tries to show that the band can hold its own without the harsh, roaring vocals that have become so overused in the metal genre.  It attempts to carry a hard-hitting political statement in musical form.  It strives to be profound in its metaphors and messages.  Most of all, it tries to differentiate Trivium from their peers.  Overall, it fails.  Quite miserably.  From the opening barrage of \"Ignition,\" it might not be clear that Trivium have changed all that much, but by the end of the third or fourth song, the listener is left with a new taste in his or her mouth: the sour flavor of potential gone awry.Now let me preface the rest of this by saying that up until now, I was a big fan of Trivium.  I've written reviews of their past two albums, each of which got at least a four.  As such, the lack of quality on \"The Crusade\" is especially bitter for me and those like me, who were expecting a more fully-realized execution of the more than sufficient blueprint that \"Ember to Inferno\" and \"Ascendancy\" capitalized on.  Call it closed-mindedness, or stubborness, or whatever you want; this release disappointed me, and the fact that it was a Trivium release disappointed me even more.Sure, it was an intriguing prospect: a brutal metalcore band shedding its abrasive vocals in favor of an all-sung style.  It's been done before (and better), but still one could not help but take an interest.  Unfortunately, the vocals on this album are even more irritating than many thought they were before.  Trivium singer and guitarist Matthew Heafy has long expressed his admiration for former thrash metal giant Metallica, but never has a vocalist (outside of a cover band) striven so hard to sound like his idol.  The result is a rather tepid performance, bogged down by the fact that anyone who's interested in this musical style has heard it all before.Lyrically, \"The Crusade\" deals with many political and social issues, and it stumbles here as well.  Turning what are meant to be rallying cries for political reform into bumbling, uneven rants, the album misses the mark several times.  On the four or so instances when it becomes very issue specific (\"Entrance of the Conflagration,\" \"And Sadness Will Sear,\" \"Unrepentant,\" \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\"), it is anywhere from two to seven years late, topic-wise.  Bruce Springsteen dealt with the same issue as \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\" much more skillfully in his controversial song \"American Skin.\"  Conversely, Trivium's attempt at metaphor by way of Japanese legend is almost laughable on \"Becoming the Dragon.\"All in all, the CD is a waste of time.  The melodies have grown rather sloppy, the solos have started to become a dime a dozen, and the musicality as a whole borrows heavily from other influences, ranging from Metallica to other metalcore outfits to past Trivium albums.  The opening of \"Tread the Floods\" is essentially a note for note carbon copy of the introduction of \"The Deceived,\" a song from Trivium's \"Ascendancy.\"  It shouldn't be surprising that what was a solid, but not extremely notable track on that album is probably one of the strongest on \"The Crusade.\"  The other highlights have their own faults: \"Anthem (We Are the Fire)\" is something one might expect on a Motley Crue CD (no offense to the Crue, but it's just out of place); \"To the Rats\" is held back by its childish, violence-for-the-sake-of-violence lyrics; \"The World Can't Tear Us Apart\" is a sappy ballad through and through.  These and a few other fleeting moments are this disc's highlights, but there's nowhere near enough to salvage the album.  \"The Crusade\" is just what its title implies: a fruitless search with an egotistical, self-important motive.\n", "val": 4.109129440621473e-05}

Well, for the most part, I'd say that label is fairly accurate....at least for this album.I'd also like to preface that I ordered all three albums from the same 3rd party seller here at the same time and this one just happen to arrive first and therefore I don't have full knowledge of what the other two sound like.Anyway, back to the \"new school Metallica\" deal.  Well, having had listened to this album twice now, it's obvious that Matt Heefy is indeed following in a vocal style similar to James Hetfield from the \"Puppets\" and \"Justice\" days.  And really, that ain't a bad thing.  Late '80s-era Metallica was the [thing] back then.  Musically, however, Trivium on this album has elements of Metallica, Iron Maiden, and even Testament.  There's the crunging sounds of Metallica, the thrash sounds of Testament, and the progressive sounds of Iron Maiden.  And quite frankly, I like it.  Being an old school thrasher metal head that I am, it's refreshing to hear metal music like this today.  So I've giving props to Matt and the gang on this one.I've been getting into the power and progressive metal scene lately, and yet this old school thrash stuff still sounds good when done right.  The only thing really updated from the old '80s stuff is the double-bass.  Well, of course, the speed of the playing is a bit faster than what we heard 20 years ago.  But what isn't these days.All and all, I give this album a solid 5 stars.  The meshing of all those old school bands really is unique.  I don't care what the critics say.

{"text": "They've been called \"The Next Metallica\" and \"The Future of Metal,\" and there is a lot to like about Trivium. The four musicians that make up this Florida-based band are undeniably talented, playing at a level of skill and musicianship that belies the fact that their average age is barely old enough to buy beer. Metal fans who cut their teeth on Metallica and Iron Maiden can appreciate the way Trivium's music pays homage to those bands--who were making music before these guys were born--while incorporating just enough metalcore, punk and even nu-metal influences to make their sound fresh.Where Trivium falls short, however, is in the vocals and lyrics of band leader Matt Heafy. Heafy is a more-than-competent composer and an excellent guitarist (though fellow guitarist Corey Beaulieu is arguably the more technically proficient shredder.) Vocally, however, he's got work to do. On Trivium's debut, \"Ascendancy,\" Heafy opted mostly for metalcore-style screaming vocals. Some guys can make screaming sound easy (Mark Hunter of Chimaira and Howard Jones of Killswitch Engage come to mind) but Heafy isn't one of them. In fact, he sounded like he was seriously damaging his voice. In what was probably a career-saving move, he took training from famed metal vocal coach Melissa Cross and has all but abandoned screaming for clean vocals on this CD. His singing isn't bad, but stylistically it borrows so much from Metallica's James Hetfield that Heafy probably owes Hetfield royalty payments.  He needs to find a style of his own.Lyrically, Heafy deserves props for tackling tough topics. On \"Unrepentant\" he addresses the practice in some Islamic cultures of killing women to preserve family honor. \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\" deals with police brutality as exhibited in the Amadou Diallo case.  He also wades into potentially risky waters in the uber-macho metal world by touching on the issue of gay-bashing; he calls out the homophobic (along with those who are ignorant and narrow-minded in general) on the opening track \"Ignition\" and again on the song \"Sadness Will Sear,\" which tells of the tragic case of Matthew Sheppard. But Heafy's lyrics are often stilted and awkward and don't really roll off the tongue. There won't be many people singing along with these songs at Trivium shows; the tracks \"Anthem (We Are The Fire)\" and \"Becoming The Dragon,\" with its nods to Japanese mythology (Heafy is half Japanese) being notable exceptions.The good news is that Heafy and his bandmates are still very young and have the chance to grow and improve. If they continue to evolve and develop--and there's every indication they will--Trivium could indeed reach the upper echelons of metal. They just aren't quite there yet\n", "val": 0.00040219788206741214}
{"text": "Ok, so obviously the new Trivium is a tribute to Metallica (it shoulld never be labeled as a Metallica Tribute Band, however; since this cd contains no Metallica covers).  I've always been a fan of Trivium.  Early Trivium was more of a death metal kind of band.  But they have always had their own sound.  It is hard for a 'death metal' band to have a unique sound since variety cannot really be found in a man screaming his heart out until his lungs errupt.  Trivium, however, is unique in quite a few ways, but I'm not going to talk about early Trivium.  This new and(improved?, eh...) Trivium is quite interesting.  I, being a huge fan of System of a Down, really enjoyed the lyrics that dealt with society issues.  However, the lyrics weren't the greatest in the world.  Other than that, they had that 'in your face' style with catchy choruses and guitar riffs.  Another problem: I was deeply dissapointed by the lack of a ballad in 'The Crusade'.  'The World Can't Tear us Apart', is the closest thing to a ballad on the album.  I loved the two ballads on 'Ascendency'.  I hoped to see a softer side to the new and (ya, improved) Trivium.  I rate this album 4 stars, because of very minor flaws.  Also, I've heard enough complaints about this being a cheesy Metallica rip-off.

The band has managed to churn out absolute trash. This music is absolutely 3rd rank. Following up the success and utter brilliance of Ascendancy would be hard, I must admit, but c'mon! This isn't even the same category. I don't even know if you can consider Trivium's previous work \"metal-core\" or in the new \"American Metal\" category, but it was metal. This is just generic rock in the vein of the newer Altern-ica and Megadeth-tomyears stuff. It's never to late to get back on the horse! I haven't given up on these guys's. They're all very young and when you are called the next Metallica, it CAN go to your head.

{"text": "I wouldn't consider myself a fan of Trivium, but I have been following the metal scene for quite a while.Trivium has chosen a new direction with this album. Their touring connection to Metallica and Iron Maiden (see the album's liner notes) has probably played a major role in their pursuit of a similar sound. I speculate that Roadrunner Records also put pressure on this group to create a more mainstream album. The label has been dropping its heavier acts and signing bands like Megadeth that do not fit with their previous brand image.This album is a disappointment to old fans, especially my friend Peter. If it were released at a different time, I would not have the option of saying, \"These guys are trying to sound like Avenged Sevenfold\". Unfortunately, I just did.\n", "val": 3.612156433518976e-05}

When I first listened to it I was disappointed because The Crusade is very different than Ascendancy.  Once I got over the fact that I wasn't getting Ascendancy II, it is in constant rotation on my iPod.  You are getting 13 solid metal songs with a mixture of thrash metal, signature melodic Trivium vocals and guitar solos that seemed to have vanished from today's music.Standout songs:  Ignition, Tread the Floods, Contempt Breeds Contamination, The RisingDefinately a must buy for Trivium fans, if you like Killswitch Engage and All That Remains you will definately dig this album.\n", "val": 0.003666528267785907}
{"text": "First, the quality of the sound is great (guitar, drums, bass, ..etc).  Second, the lyrical content is mature and thought provoking.  An added enhancement is that the vocals are not in the \"cookie-monster\" grunting \"wuff-wuff\" style (I can actually understand what they're saying). Third, the speed and time signature changes are very impressive.  Fourth, guitar solos are varied, fluid, and not over the top virtuosity. That's what Trivium did well on this release.  What they didn't have is good melody or great musical-hooks.  Tracks 1-4 have some good hooks, the instrumental track is very melodic, but the remaining tracks are just rythmic riffing.  Sometimes the vocals tone don't match the rythmic tone, i.e. it sounds like they use a lot of diminshed scales in their riffing, which is difficult to sing over.Other impressions:  This release reminded me of Metallica and Testament when it came to riffing and vocals and Iron Maiden in some parts when it came to twin guitars and some solos.  That's not a bad sound or influence at all!  However, the latter bands, with the exception of most of Testament's work, have good melodic structures in their music.For those reasons above, I'm taking away one star for melodic content.  I think this is a great band, and I enjoy that they're not afraid to introduce guitar virtuosity when other new metal acts shy away from that.  They do have talent, and I think they'll definitely improve more with time.  Good luck, Trivium.\n", "val": 0.0673922598361969}

Good homage, Bad Trivium . Their old sound was righteous ,and their lyrics were as thought provoking as any to come out of the last decade of music. This would have been a great pet project . But as a follow up to Ascendancy, i don't think so. These guys are young and have many years worth of awesome music under their belts just waiting to come out.

{"text": "I tried to enjoy this CD -- I really did.  Despide never being a fan of the nasal emocore vocals, I thoroughly enjoyed Trivium's last CD (Ascendancy) and was anticipating this one like no other. However, when I read an interview in which Matt Heafy said that Trivium's goal was to \"become the next Metallica\", I thought it was a simple metaphor:  They wanted to be the band that carried heavy metal to new distances and became almost synonymous with the genre, right?  Unfortunately for me (and for my expectations), I was wrong.  With this CD, Trivium has sort of fallen off the radar for me.  Granted, the CD has their signature shredder guitars and vocals...but it sounds so much like an early Metallica release (with lower mid levels) that I'm terribly disappointed in the guys in Trivium.  When they said that they wanted to be \"the next Metallica\", I didn't think they meant they were going to become, for all practical purposes, a Metallica cover band.  Although the songs are originally written by Trivium, everything from the drum rhythms to the overly-mixed vocals is reminiscent of early Metallica, so much so that I begin to wonder what creativity Trivium has left.  These guys really had a lot going for them -- an original sound, blazing fast guitars, and new melodies.  I'm giving \"The Crusade\" two stars because I think the music sounds good, up until you realize how painfully wannabe it is.  Now it's trying to be \"Ride the Lightning\" all over again...sadly, it comes across more as Trivium's own rendition of \"St. Anger\"  Buy it if you're a Trivium fan, or if you like the singles off the CD.  Otherwise, stay clear of this one and cross your fingers that they will find their individuality again.\n", "val": 0.0002790674043353647}
{"text": "There seems to be some criticism for the  \"The Crusade\", yet I see it as a breakthrough for Trivium. Thrash Metal just a memory when it comes to newer bands that come out on the scene, (unless it bands from the heyday of the period that are still releasing Thrash album such as the likes of Exodus, Overkill, and Anthrax) but Trivum has brought back the element of Thrash in their music. Does it sound like Metallica, well, not really. There is a similar style of vocals to Hetfield, but when it comes to the actual music, and not the vocal, its a strong mix of Thrash and Progressive Metal, straight out of the 1980's. Its not as \"Speed Driven\" as Metallica's \"Kill Em All,\" or \"Ride the Lighting\" and is a bit more complex on strong stuture, such as Iron Maiden and Dream Theater. Actually, if you want to make a comparsion to vocals, I believe that it is close to Chuck Billy from Testament. Whatever you want to compare it to, it is a really strong effort from this young band. I was not impressed with the first two albums, as Vocalist Matthew was using a high pitched scream, then mixing it in with some singing. I wasn't impressed with the vocal then, since it didn't seem to fit with the music, and it was like the vocal was over-powering the musicans. If you don't have a clue in what I am talking about, think Linkin Park, with the high pitched throat, then going into singing. On \"The Crusade\", Matt diches that style and it really seems to flow. I am so impressed with the album, that enjoyed every song. Maybe not the most intelligent lyric, but that doesnt take away from the strong musicanship on this album. So many complaints on how it sounds to much like Metallica or 80's Thrash, but doing something different from the rest of the Metal Masses is good. I mean, how many damn Metal bands are coming out and all sound the same. They all breed themselves after Korn, Limp Biskit, Slipknot, and Disturbed. Its about time that we get a band that decides to shake it up a bit, and go back to the great days of Thrash and Progressive Metal. This is a great effort, and its so impressive from a bunch of guys that aren't even old enough to get a beer yet. This is great. ENJOY\n", "val": 0.05623134970664978}
{"text": "Big fan of the previous release Ascendency, but this album is crud. Heafy does not have a decent enough voice to sing \"clean\" for songs in their entirety. The odd chorus and so forth is fine but it is not powerful enough to drive it home when listening to a 5 minute song. And the lyrical content, lame to say the least. Extrememly corny at times. The song about the Koi turning into a beast, I know he has the Asian heritage happening but this song is dreadful. The guitars are average and ditto with the drums. Production is fine, actually really good, but the actual riffs themselves, whilst there are some decent ones (that invoke many a memory of old school '80s thrash) the majority seemed rushed and not much thought has gone into them. It's a real shame, because i think if they spent a bit more time between the 2 albums they could have made a really good album because they do have it in them, as is evident in \"Ascendency\" but for mine this whole album seems rushed to try and roll with the current hype that surrounds the band. And whilst we all know that they are huge metallica fans, I didn't know they were trying to channel them for gods sake. At times you would be forgiven to think that you are listening to Metallica back in it's heyday, but they are 20 years too late and it has already been done before, but a hell of a lot better.  Unfortunatley this album takes a left turn at somewhere between mediocre and crap which is really disappointing as this was an album that I was looking forward to buying since it's rumoured began at the end of last year.

{"text": "I have been a fan of Trivium ever since they released Ember to Inferno. I automatically fell in love with the brutality of their music and how intelligent and well written it was for kids who were 3 years younger than me. Ascendancy was decent as well but, The Crusade blows Ascendancy out of the water by far. The songs on this album are smashingly, old -school, heavy metal riffing, layered with fat bass lines and sprinkled with blistering solos that haven't been heard since the 80's. Trivium distance themselves from \"metalcore\" and return to their roots. \"Entrance of the Conflagration\" is a great thrashy, angry song about this woman who drowns her kids in a tub. The drum part is amazing and the chanting is catchy yet eiree.  \"Anthem\" is also a good song that brings the fun back into metal. Who the hell said we have to be depressed and dark to play or enjoy metal anyway?Matt and Corey really shine on this track as it is smothered in sweep appreggios and two-hand tapping, trade-off solos. one thing I particularly enjoyed about this record was \"Becoming the Dragon\". That song made me want to start an old-school pit in my room and punch holes in the wall. And guess what else? A blistering bass solo by Paulo Greggeletto himself done in the fashion of Cliff Burton circa 1983. My only criticism really lies in \"The World Can't tear us Apart\" ,it isn't a bad song or anything but, it doesnt really sound like Trivium at all. I guess it just goes to show you that they can actually write a slow song without screaming and whining. Does it sound like Metallica? Not really. Maybe Testament or old Anthrax or Iron Maiden but, not Metallica. If you are a true fan of metal and not so much core than you will enjoy this cd.

The musicianship is faultless. But the rest of the album just seems unfocused and generic, lacking in hooks and totally forgettable. The disc sputters to a conclusion with an 8 minute instrumental that is a real chore to slog through.

The guitar work on this album is fantastic but I must admit, I liked the guitar a little bit better on Ascendancy.  However, the lyrics and guitar work make this nothing short of fantastic.  Not a bad song on the whole album.  This band will have a great future and this album is definitely one of the best metal cds in 2006.\n", "val": 0.06004279851913452}
{"text": "Ember to Inferno was Trivium's first CD.  A great piece of work, considering they were four guys making an underground metal sound.Ascendancy is their second.  Sure, they began to become more mainstream, but they improved their sound from Ember.  An absolutley amazing ORIGINAL sound.The Crusade is probably one of the biggest let downs of this year.  I really hate to say that about such a talented band as Trivium, but what reasoning would make them give up their original sound to be more like Metallica?  Why would you want to sound like a band who years ago declared that \"Metal is dead?\"  Heafy and the others are extremely talented musicians, and it shows in the actual songs, but the singing style is totally different.Why did they sell out?\n", "val": 0.04698659107089043}
{"text": "I like many people like to check out reviews before purchasing an album, even if it is one of my favorite bands releasing a new cd. I almost didn't buy this CD because of all the negative reviews. NEVER AGAIN!! Many people criticize this album for changing so dramatically. I would most definitely have to agree with them, but in my opinion it is an amazing change. Heafy may not scream as much anymore, but he has lost no aggression whatsoever. Trivium is just as heavy as they were in Ascendancy (one of my favorite albums of all time) only with slightly more melody. They broke away from the scream during verse and sing melodically during chorus mold and I think it improved their sound. Solos on Ascendancy were amazing, but nothing compared to The Crusade. THis is my favorite album of 2006 for sure, and possibly even through 2007 as well. Trivium fixed everything wrong with Ascendancy and made a more complete album. Good Work Guys!\n", "val": 0.016445519402623177}

{"text": "This review will begin by quoting from what I found to be the most helpful and entertaining reviews written up until this point.  I will then offer a few thoughts of mine on the album.  The quotes:\"If you consider aggressive Metal _singing_ to be a James Hetfield copyright, think again. One imagines that all these whines about the likeness to Metallica comes from the fact that the only Real Metal other than the trendy neo-Metal alternatives that these people have actually heard _is_ Metallica\"  (Bexborn Richard, 5 stars)\"From hardcore breakdowns, to Paul Gilbert / Kirk Hammet worthy solos, and chunky palm-muted thrash rhythms, simply put this CD PWNS\"  (Lloyd Correa \"Wareuph\", 5 stars )\"It's uninspired, cliche-ridden, and kind of boring, at times...Two thumbs down. I gave it an extra star because it does have some great guitar solos, and I like solos\" (Joel Israel \"prog-metal climber dude\", 2 stars)\"Thrash metal is BACK! The music alone is amazing--that crucial, thick, crunch of the guitars, the fluid and melodic soloing technique, the epic movements!!! YES...MOVEMENTS!!!!\" (JC, 4 stars)\"Adapting to the vocal style is something that an \"Ascendancy\" fan should do, because once it's done, \"The Crusade\" is simply overpowering\" (C. Bakehorn, 5 stars).\"Perhaps what's most impressive about this record is that Trivium are capable of wearing their influences on their sleeves, but they never come across as a terribly unoriginal band\" (A. Stutheit \"andreaabs\", 4 stars)\"Trivium unleashes a metal monster with their latest disc! Looking to further evolve, the band ditched the drop D tuning for this recording and did a good chunk of it in a standard tuning, with Paolo thumping away at a 5 string bass\"  (C. Taylor \"Wyld Weasil\", 5 stars).\"Finally something comes out that sounds like old school thrash metal and guess what? - people are still going to whine about it being influenced by Metallica and Megadeth, which are two of the best bands ever\"  (David W. Atchison \"dwatch1\", 5 stars).\"Man, metalcore fans are stupid\" (M. Keel, 5 stars)\"Here's to all you poseurs who say you know what metal is because you listen to a bunch of wannabe punk rockers who are able to play three chords in drop D tuning... This is real metal!! Love it or leave it and go back to metalcore where everything sounds the same\" (C. Hicks, 5 stars).  Well, I hope that was a helpful selection.  Here's my contribution:  It was obvious to me on Trivium's first two albums that the band have ample talent, and great song writing ability.  Here's what I saw as the problems, and the ways in which the new album redeems them:1. Matt's vocals were not really listenable.  I love throat vocals, it was not the harshness that was unappealing, but the shallowness and lack of range in his growl.  The advantage of the vocals on 'The Crusade' are a greater range of emotion, and the fact that vocal lines are pitched, not just screamed (ineffectively).2. The familiar metal-core feel of the songs.  The structure of many songs just felt formulaic, and therefore, the discs did not receive that much play time from me.  The new album has a fantastic thrash metal feel, as well as other metal influences, and the riffs (and solos!) are very satisfying and impressive.3.  Production and drums.  The double bass was impressive, but the production smothered them for the most part, making Travis work up a sweat for little effect.  The production AND the drumming on the new album are superior to the previous two.  While there is not as much straight double bass, the drums are fuller and more appropriate, adding more to the atmosphere of the music.  Sometimes, the notes (and beats) that are not played are as important as those that are.And now I'm done.\\m/  METAL!!!  \\m/\n", "val": 0.01665647327899933}

I do like the singing, as I'm an old school metal fan, and I don't consider it a sell-out as many have called it.  However, I got to know Trivium through Ascendancy, and later Ember to Inferno, and the change on The Crusade kind of threw me for a loop even though I knew before hearing the album this was the direction they were taking.  I used to hate the screaming and Ascendancy was one of the records that finally got me to \"get over it.\"  lol  Anyway, this is a good record with obvious Metallica, Megadeth and Iron Maiden influence on it.

Second, the foolish hypocrisy you present is just laughable.  You think that the screaming of one vocalist sounds so different from the other?  This only proves that too many feeble minded individuals crave monotony in metal music.  Trivium has presented an album that breaks away from the safe formula.  Instead of repeating their previous album they have produced an even more entertaining sound.  Don't try to analyze music so much, it's beyond your complete comrehension.  Don't pretend to be an authority on it.

{"text": "Before I start this review I would just like to say that metal is kind of in a slump. In the 80's metal was about ber-fast guitar solos, and high pitched vocals over relatively lightly distorted guitars. Being a guitar player myself, when I listen to a new metal CD, they are the main focus for me. Lets just say that the guitars on the Crusade don't disappoint. But more on that in a sec. Why is metal in a slump? The same reason it was in a slump in the 90's. Too many \"me-too\" bands. But this time in addition to that theres too much screaming, too many breakdowns, and way too few guitar solos. The thing that REALLY pisses me off is the screaming over light wimpy guitar chords. Well, Trivium address this problem and many more on their new CD, and completely renew my faith in modern metal in the process. Oh, and if you play guitar ... this CD is like guitar porn. From hardcore breakdowns, to Paul Gilbert / Kirk Hammet worthy solos, and chunky palm-muted thrash rhythms, simply put this CD PWNS. Oh, and theres almost NO screaming (I put scream alert by the songs where he screams, but note that he only does so for like 10-20 seconds on average. Thats it.). Matt Heafy is a recent graduate from the James Hetfield school of tough guy vocals. If you like Metallica, or Megadeth, or any old-school thrash without screaming in it, you'll LOVE this CD. Here is the track-by-track breakdown and review.1.) Ignition - 10/10 - Ahh, the beginning of one of the sweetest metal CDs in recent memory. Great standard tuning riffs, and a really sweet chorus. Oh, and about 3+ guitar solos. A perfect start.2.) Detonation (scream alert) - 10/10 - One of my favorites on the CD. It starts off with an evil sounding riff, and like the first track addresses a nuclear apocalypse that is a little TOO near to reality. Heavy enough for today's metal, yet 80's enough for the metal of yesterday.3.) Entrance of the Conflagration - 10/10 - Yeah, still not slowing down. Another potential thrash classic with a cool Church Choral opening. This song further proves that Matt Heafy is a master of lyrical imagery. Heavy in standard tuning?! #%&* yeah.4.) Anthem (we are the fire) - 8/10 - Finally, a song that isn't PERFECT. It might be for some, but for me its a little TOO 80's hair metal. Its not a bad song by any means, just a little too \"metal brotherhood\" with light guitars for me.5.) Unrepentant - 10/10 - Holy crap this song is amazing. Check out the lyrics: A poor man, with four daughters, and one commits adultery. Then he kills her. This song has one of the best metal chorus' ... EVER in my opinion. Once again standard tuning, yet as heavy as a dump truck.6.) And Sadness Will Sear - 9/10 - Wow, the first riff of this song introduces the listener to 7-string guitars. Throughout the rest of the album, 7-strings are the name of the game (I think). What is a 7-string guitar? Hear for yourself. The same as a 6-string but able to pull off a heaviness not heard since Meshuggah's Destroy Erase Improve. Awesome song, but its missing *something*.7.) Becoming the Dragon (scream alert)- Infinity/10 - lol, ok just a 10/10, but easily my favorite on the entire CD. Why? Let me count the ways: The mythical fantasy dragon lyrics come off as knowledgeable as opposed to cheesy, the guitar solos on this song are arguably the sweetest on the entire CD, and my favorite part about it is the music matches the lyrics; At the end of the song when Heafy sings about the evolution being complete, about 30 seconds later the riff transforms into one of the heaviest this side of ...and justice for all. Palm-muted 7-string DISGUSTLINGLY heavy crunch. THEN check out the dragonlike serpentine guitar solos that almost seem to wrap around the rhythm guitar crunch. A masterpiece.8.) To the Rats (scream alert) - 10/10 - Ahh, this song is a (my) personal f-you to all the haters. A relatively light 6-string guitar riff is beefed up in the pre-chorus with the 7th string, and the lyrics are just icing on the cake. THIS is the anthem.9.) This World Can't Tear us Apart - 7/10 - Hmm. Easily the worst song on the album, yet most bands would sell their souls to write like this. A nice 7-string crunch is ruined by incredibly cheesy love lyrics. I hope hes singing about something else than some stupid girl ...10.) Tread the Floods - 9/10 - Now Trivium gets back on track. This song has some really cool riffs, but is somewhat brought down by the kinda by-the-book chorus. Otherwise, another great Trivium crowd pleaser.11.) Contempt Breeds Contamination - 10/10 - Another song that has amazing lyrical imagery. Not to mention a simply *punishing* verse guitar riff. The chorus is also incredible. Songs like this and Unrepentant prove that Trivium are one-of-a-kind in metal today. And I mean that in the best way. ANOTHER smoking Trivium track.12.) The Rising - 8/10 - Ahhh, this song could've been featured in Top Gun or pretty much ANY 80's movie. Its THAT 80's. There is a relatively modern crunch, but the \"metal brotherhood\" lyrics, and high string guitar antics put this song right in there with Anthem. It still rocks, but in a high-five break out the boombox on the shoulder kind of way.13.) The Crusade - 10/10 - OMFG. An Instrumental?!? In a modern metal CD?!? WTF?!? No. It really is my friends. And its a %#@*!&^ sweet one too. Think Orion, with 7-strings, and generally with much more guitar shredding. While not exactly *breath-taking* on first listen, give it another shot, and you'll agree its '06s Call of Cthulu. Thank you Trivium, for bringing Tr-Metal back.\n", "val": 0.012828600592911243}
{"text": "All I can say is WOW! , just WOW !!!.  Trivium has matured/morphed into a dominating world-class metal band that few will ever match.  This is one of the best CD's I've heard in years.Last year I left a review for Ascendancy saying that these guys were good and maturing but not the \"next-Metallica\" people were calling them.  I even called them over-rated and suggested that Matt use his excellent voice instead of all the lame scream-o crap.  I'm in total shock in what I am hearing in The Crusade.  This is a CD that takes old-school Metallica, Testament, Megadeth and Hatrix(listen to the lead guitar solos) and adds their own fresh, unique brand of groove and heaviness.  If the guys in Metallica were all 20 today and just putting out their 2nd or 3rd CD, this is what you would get.  Metallica today doesn't stand a chance in hell of putting out music anywhere near this quality.  Comparing Trivium to Metallica today would be an insult to the guys in Trivium.  They are much better than Metallica now.The growth on this CD is just amazing.  I really do forsee this CD as being looked at 10-20 years from now as a classic that brought metal back.  It really is that good.  Also, this is one of those CD's that hits you so hard, you really need to listen to it 4 or 5 times to understand it and appreciate its brilliance.I do understand the mixed reviews this CD is receiving.  The younger crowd wanting Scream-O vocals and a nu-metal sound is not going to understand this CD.  Trivium is NOT nu-metal.  These guys are set to rip the throne away from bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Judas Priest, Slayer, etc.  I for one am amazed and truly thankful to hear music like this.

{"text": "Aaaah, Trivium. In the last couple of years, there has been a lot of hoopla about this \"up and coming\" young metal band who supposedly harkens back to the days of old-school thrash metal ala Megadeth, Metallica, Testament, etc. Of course, these are all the bands that I had grown up with and loved when I was younger as an altervative to all of the pop-hair-and-makeup-metal so prevalent at the time, so I was interested in hearing it. After a couple of spins, well....I think not. Where to start...I think that it is impressive that the frontman of this band is so young (I think he is actually a teenager...he may be 20 or 21)and he is a good guitar player...some of his solos are very impressive-he is certainly technically proficient, as is the other guitarist. My complaint is the fact that there have been five or ten other recent metal bands (Lamb of God, God Forbid, Mastodon, etc.)who have just put out releases which are head and shoulders above anything on this disc. It's uninspired, cliche-ridden, and kind of boring, at times. The vocals, as well, are particularly annoying, and the fourth track, \"Anthem(We Are The Fire)\" has what is perhaps the most laughably bad chorus I have ever heard in a metal album. Sure, it's heavy, but you've heard similiar and better riffs before if you are any kind of a metal fan, and it is remarkably inconsistent in lyrical content, tone, and songwriting.

If you are going to write a politically charged album try and stay current.

{"text": "This cd is really a well... i dunno i mean its an obvious change.  Weird how if this cd was released 20 years ago when thrash metal bands like metallica, megadeth, testament ect were just coming out, Trivium's \"The Crusade\" would have been praised with no poor reviews in site.  But the 1980's were some time ago and in the new age of heavy metal the metal-core scence has taken full force.  So Trivium's 3rd release is a real depature from their previos break through album the ascndency (which i absolutely loved).  The Crusade sounds little like previous Trivium work but hey thats ok.  Trivium took a nice approach on old school thrash metal.  They have some nice solos which maybe some people might not agree with but the last song 'the crusade' which i think is all instrumental is a great showing of the talent the band has.  All the tracks are rather nice but like i said different from previous work.  Only true complain like  everyone else is that the lead singer was sounding just a little too much like James from old school metallica days.  Some songs as I listen remind me of \".. And Justic For All\" in how the vocals were sung.  So really aside from that complain which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5, the album is really a nice step... or well experimental album depending on what Triviums next release is.

The only thing that kept this album from being a 5 in my opinion was definetly the vocals.

Still, I took the risk and got The Crusade last night, immediately finding myself headbanging in the car by the second song!  Thrash metal is BACK!  The music alone is amazing--that crucial, thick, crunch of the guitars, the fluid and melodic soloing technique, the epic movements!!!  YES...MOVEMENTS!!!!  And while I will admitt that the singing is very much James Hetfield-esk, there is still a twinge of pure Heafy in there to add a progressive touch to their tribute to \"the good ol' days\".The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is because of the lyrics.  This is perhaps the true showing of their youth or perhaps just poor writing plain and simple.  Half the songs on the CD are quite contrived really, though hardly noticable for the most part.  The messages Trivium hope to address are worthy and relevant.  The only song where the triteness is truly evident is the love song/ballad.

{"text": "Trivium has dropped the \"Core\" and fully embraced the Metal.When I first heard these guys through \"Ascendancy\", I was intrigued. I couldn't believe it when I discovered their young collective age; there was some real talent at work here. What dismayed me, however, was the utter cookie-cutter fashion of their Metalcore style: Screaming verses and melodic choruses, so prevalent with their Metalcore peers. In effect, I made a mental note of the name Trivium as having future potential, while \"Ascendancy\" was left to collect dust on the shelf. I had simply had my fill of the Metalcore formula through bands such as Killswitch Engage and Shadow's Fall; these two filled the shoes for the need of Metalcore to these ears more than sufficiently.Enter \"The Crusade\": An awesome Metal album full of intensity, hooks and technical prowess. This is REAL METAL sans the core, folks. All I can really say to people who appreciate REAL METAL is BUY IT NOW. Trendies need not apply, as is quite apparent from all the whining I've read in these reviews.If you consider aggressive Metal _singing_ to be a James Hetfield copyright, think again. Before the cookie monster left the puppet industry for the music industry, Metal singers actually carried a tune with their voice. Wow, imagine that. One imagines that all these whines about the likeness to Metallica comes from the fact that the only Real Metal other than the trendy neo-Metal alternatives that these people have actually heard _is_ Metallica.Want to talk about sounding the same and copying styles? Ok, how about the way Heafy sang up until now, mimicking exactly all of the other Metalcore acts? How about all the Death Metal cookie-monster clones out there? How about the chugga-chugga-emo-emo-chugga-chugga sameness of all the current Metalcore [...] out there these days?To close this up, I'll just finish off by saying that I would rather be compared to classic Metallica than Killswitch Engage any day, but I guess that's just me.\n", "val": 0.0009054355905391276}

{"text": "Despite what some say about this new album, it's still great. I can kinda see where some people think that it sounds like old Metallica which is probably good considering to most people old Metallica sounds better than newer Metallica. There's just more of the overall thrash metal sound that's present when you listen. Some say Trivium are a \"metalcore\" band. WRONG! They've never claimed to be one, and I can agree with 'em. Anybody that wants to argue needs to research more on the band. Not that I wanna take anything away from Ascendancy (which was a great album), but all those notions that came from that album and Ember To Inferno are gone here. Less screaming vocals, a more Hetfield vocal approach. The guitars were even tuned to standard rather than dropped D. There's more emphasis on metal from the eighties (ex: Megadeth, Testament, Skid Row, Metallica, etc.). I've never lost faith in these guys, and that's not because they're from Florida (my home state). Just because they were inspired to use their influences more this time, that makes them sound like less the band you thought they were? That doesn't make sense to me.\n", "val": 0.018432600423693657}
{"text": "Trivium, a band that has really evolved in a quick amount of time. They debuted with the immature \"Embers to Inferno\" an album that I just couldn't find myself getting into. However, I decided to give them one more shot with their sophmore album in the Spring of 2005. The album was \"Ascendancy\" and to be honest, I don't think any album spent more time in my walkman than it that Summer. \"Pull Harder on the Strings of your Martyr\" was more of a religion than a song to me for a few months. The vocals were seen as metalcore, I didn't see it like that though. I saw them more as progressive heavy metal. I mean, Matt Heavy was wearing a Darkthrone shirt in the promo picture. Doesn't sound very trendy to me. Everything was a step up, even the vocals. I was lucky enough to see them live this Summer, they put on an amazing show. They played Detonation, this was the first time that I would hear any material from \"The Crusade\" Plus they played Master of Puppets, they played it perfectly. The new  vocals blew me away and the song writing  seemed quite sharp. So just like Ascendancy, everything was stepped up with this album,everything better than before. I see numerous influences in Matt's new vocals, not just James H. This album is basically 80's Metallica + Pantera + Megadeth. I hate how people whine about this album. This is 100 % pure heavy/thrash metal. I wouldn't say this is the metal album of the year because Iron Maiden and Deicide both released classic albums this year,  however it is one of the best. Another thing I knew, the guitar is definetly more thrash influenced, while  not losing that Iron Maiden esque melody in them; this really pushes the boundries for what Trivium can do. The lyrics seem to me a bit more political than on previous releases, even though they hinted at it on Ascendancy. It doesn't hurt the album lyrically, or come off as cliche and cheesy, which impressed me. Finally, the use of keyboards and  acoustic guitars are used occasionally. They are placed perfectly and set a wonderful atmosphere for the song.1. Ignition (3:54) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: HeafyOne of my favorite songs off of this album; you can really feel the Metallica influences on the verses, yet the chorus takes this song to a new level. With acoustic guitars and piano, along with melodic singing which blends well with the guitar. This song very much reflects society as it is today. The lyrics are well written. The song changes structures are quite different, yet they're done smoothly and nothing seems out of place or forced. Around the 2:10 mark, Heafy has a short but wonderful solo before heading back into the thrash influenced verse/pre-chorus. This song ends with some haunting and creepy acoustic guitars that carrys over into the first few seconds of the next song. 5/52. Detonation (4:28) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: HeafyOne of if not the best songs here. I love how Heafy flows his vocals through this song, it is carried out perfectly. It is impressive because if done the wrong way, it would have come out sounding sloppy and horrid. The Detonation chant gives reason to headbang and is a great chant live. Around 2:19, Matt Heafy starts some far away singing over a low melodic riff before heading into one of the best vocal parts of this album. In fact, the final two minutes of this song may just be the magnus opus for this album. This song also features the best solos on the album (2 by Matt and one by Corey) they have a really dramatic feel to it, almost epic. This song ends with one of the best melodic riffs I have heard in recent years. 10/53. Entrance of the Conflagration. (4:38) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: HeafyThis song focuses more on Travis(drums) and paolo(bass) on the intro to this song. Which in my opinion, features Travis best work since \"Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr\" The chorus is typical (in a good way) for this album. Some good melodic singing. After the 2nd chorus  comes to a close, we have a  pretty thrashy interlude before the melodic chant of the intro comes back for the moment. Coreys solo screams Megadeth worship here, which is great. Matt on the other hand has a  more melodic almost flashy solo. It really shows off his talent. I believe the lyrical content, is in regards to the woman who supposedly killed her children in the name of God. In fact, it should be obvious as Heafy is quite blunt about it in his lyrics. 4/54. Anthem (We Are the Fire) (4:03) Music: Heafy, Gregoletto / lyrics: HeafyThis song really does seem like a good representation/ Anthem (no lame pun intended) for this album. Definetly a song I could see being mind blowing live. THe guitar is some good catchy thrash. I love the lyrics in the chorus, they really oculd pick up  and inspire anybody in need of it. Plus the group scream of \"We are the fire!) is great. Half way through, Corey and Matt go back and forth with dueling solos before those  crashing anthem drums kick in, with a chant. My heart took an extra beat after I heard this war chant outro. I could find no better way to end this song. However, it manages to pull off another amazing performance of the chorus before it goes out with a bang. I could see this as a classic thrash song in 10 years. 5/55. Unrepentant (4:51) Music: Beaulieu / Lyrics: HeafyThe intro riff, seems like it may have  fit with comfort on Metallica's \"Master  of Puppets\" album. This song has some odd lyrical content of a man with 5 children (four daughters and one son) along  with his wife. Apparently, as the story tells us, one of his daughters commits adultery because of this, he feels the need to kill all his  daughters. The first verse vocal wise, are typical yet hte rest is nothing but. Heafy's vocals are shockingly good here, I didn't know he had a performance vocally like this in him. Everything about this song, is heavy yet has such a melancholic atmosphere to it. Which just goes to show you the range this band has in it. Coreys solo is pretty fast and respectable. I lvoe the riff  that comes in after his solo, before launching into mroe amazing vocals. 6/56. And Sadness Will Sear (3:34) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: HeafyThis song, is much slower and has a creepy feel to it. Exspecially at the start. The music feels rather simple here, or atleast compared to the rest of the album. It isn't a ballad type song, just a sad eerie one. Paolo really adds to it with his wonderful bass work. The bridge really is what makes this song  amazing. All of a sudden a much more melodic kicks in and Matt sings his heart out with some poetic lyrical content, then Matt comes in with another great solo, which is  basically the icing on the cake for me. Before heading into the eerie chorus with the help of another great riff brought to you by Corey. By this time, the song slowly dies out. 4.5/5Becoming the Dragon (4:43) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: HeafyThis is definetly a more Iron Maiden influenced song musically. Which at first seemed to me, as if it clashed with Heafy's thrash metal vocals but over the the first minute or so, they blend together much better. The chorus only further proves this point in my eyes. Then at 1:25, the song crashes down a big wave of headbanging greatness. At this point, Matt adds some of his Ascendancy style vocals, which are perfectly placed. Then the music does a 360 back to a thrash style which includes Corey ripping up anohter great solo. Then it basically repeats itsself. Which is perfectly fine with me. The song  is then put together  by two solos one by Paolo and then Heafy finishes it off. 5/58. To the Rats (3:42) Music: Gregoletto / Lyrics HeafyThis shorter song, starts with a single riff before Travis brings the song full circle. The lyrics here sound cheesy. Lyrically, it seems to try to recapture the arrogant swagger that was the classic \"Walk\" by Pantera. However, Matt can't capture it like Phil Anselmo was able to. This is probably my least favorite song here, even though it is still pretty decent. I just wish the song wasn't so predictable. Which this does suffer from. Even the solos sound a little stale. It is still worth a few spins though. What makes it said,is Travis he really gives a great performance. 3.5/59. This World Can't Tear us Apart (3:30 Music: Heafy / Lyrics: HeafyEvery great album, needs a great ballad. This is one of the best ballads i've heard in years. This song, features the most melody and some really heart felt vocals/lyrics. The chorus, as catchy and  corny as it is, holds a special place in my heart and sounds great to me. A really touching song, with anybody with a special somebody should appreciate. This song is also a nice breathe of fresh air as it is much more mellow than songs before/after on this album. The song takes a small break with a solo and guitar change before heaidng back into the epic chorus. Truly a well written ballad. 6/510. Tread the Floods (3:33) Music: Beaulieu / Lyrics: HeafyJust when you thought it was safe.......the next song starts off with a signature Trivium riff and some slow drumming, before heading into a verse with a really nice back and forth riff between Matt and Corey. Heafy experiments a bit with his vocals, trying to sound a little less scratchy. I'm not really sure if it works for him or not, I would have to hear him use it more. The guitar work is what really makes this song works. It goes from slow to fast in the snap of a finger. Corey then breaks the door down on that idea with a lightning fast solo which leads into a melodic fill in from Heafy. Some of the best guitar work you will find on this album. 4.5/511. Contempt Breeds Contamination (4:28) Music: Heafy / Lyrics: HeafyThis song wastes no time to pick up speed. It is going 100 mph right out of the starting gate. Heafy has some great vocals as the guitar almost seems to bring out his vocals even more. This is seen most of all in the pre-chorus. This song, basically seems to be about those who left us behind when the died in vain. I could listen to the pre-chorus/chorus all day. It really brought out the potential this song had. This song also has something rare for Trivium. The solos here, aren't lightning fast per say. It takes its time to build up. it really fits well and doesn't force anything. 5/512. The Rising (3:44)  Music: Greggoletto / Lyrics: HeafyAnother amazing performance by Travis, who really was an unsung hero on the majority of this record. It has a few forgettable guitar riffs but the rest of the song saves it from being lost among the other songs. Another anthem like chorus that is slower but should get the heart thumping. The song will throw you for a loop. When you think it goes left, it goes right and vice versa. Should please fans of Megadeth's slower work such as the \"Youthanasia\" album. I thought this song would choke out at 2 and a half minutes but coreys great guitar and travis' anthem like drums shock it back to life as Heafys moivating message closes out the song. 5/513. The Crusade  Music: HeafyWe now arrive at the epic 8 + minute outro/insturmental. It is quite amazing to say the least. It ends this album with a talented bang. You rarely see songs like this pulled off well these days. This song features 5 solos. One by paolo, two by Matt and two by Corey. They really put their heart into the guitar work here and it shows. the first 1 minute + is non stop thrash before a slower melodic riff kicks in and the rest of the song can take a breathe. However, the song slowly finds itsself getting into a groove again with this new found riff, until it goes to another musical change and maybe the best for this song around 2:20. The solo pulled off after it is pretty quick but beautifully done before pulling back into riffs past on this song. As soon as that groove comes back, Matt and co aresure to rip your throat out with sped up thrash metal. This goes on for the next 5 minutes, solos back and forth before at 8 minutes the music slowly starts to die away. Ending this amazing journey.To end this, Trivium is a band that gets a bad rep from some people, for no real reason. They are an amazing and talented band in my eyes. As I said a while back, if they keep releasing albums  like this, they will join the lieks of classic thrash bands of past, present and  future. Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.03765622153878212}
{"text": "Orlando metal band Trivium's third album, \"The Crusade,\" is quite a departure from the metalcore sound heard in their sophomore album, \"Ascendancy.\" No puns intended (\"Departure\" is one of that album's better tracks). Vocalist Matthew Heafy and the band have decided to play with a style that mimics popular metal bands of the 1980's and early 90's. Heafy's even grown his hair out. The end result of the transition is an album that tastes like the same Trivium, only cooked and served with perfection.\"Ascendancy,\" and before it, \"Ember to Inferno\" were pretty unique in their sound and style. This made Trivium much less prone to comparisons to other metal bands, though they still fell into the metalcore genre. It's too bad that \"The Crusade\" will inevitably draw comparisons to 1980's/90's legends Metallica, Megadeath, and Iron Maiden. Like fellow metalheads Avenged Sevenfold before them, Trivum have taken a step back and returned to the older thrash style of music that deserves credit for making modern, mainstream metal what it is today. In almost all ways, they've improved. Their musicmanship has definitely matured and the lyrics are another big improvement. One of \"Ascendancy's\" better tracks was the radio-friendly \"Dying In Your Arms.\" The leave of absence from the brutal growling and screaming that populated \"Ascendancy\" is welcome, and the singing vocals found in \"The Crusade\" are much unlike those found in the singalong bridges and chrouses found throughout last year's album.Adapting to the vocal style is something that an \"Ascendancy\" fan should do, because once it's done, \"The Crusade\" is simply overpowering. The vocals are just a little too Hetfield-ish, but they're easily tolerable when one begins to appreciate the talent of Matthew Heafy. Heafy is a man who can sing very well and with emotion, whether the feeling is angry, hopeful, or passionate.The songs destined to be singles, \"Detonation\" and \"Anthem (We Are The Fire)\" are what many listeners will quickly pick up on and enjoy. It would be quite a sin to deny the brutal double-bass drum and the entire second half of \"Detonation,\" which is quite passionate and throbs the political vein. Next up is the very-notable track \"Sadness Will Sear.\" It has a slower tempo but it carries all the same intensity as other songs found on the album. Fans of past Trivium albums might want to skip right to tracks seven and eight and appreciate \"Becoming The Dragon\" and \"To The Rats,\" which feature some of that familiar Heafy screaming and breakdowns that invite quite the poundings of the fist. \"To The Rats\" has a chorus that is an overpowering stench of the 1980's but its entire middle section is impressive. \"Becoming The Dragon\" isn't perfect, and I thought it tried to put too many different pieces of metal into one song--there's a breakdown, a solo, loads of bridges--the song seems to lack the clear direction of other songs.My personal favorite tracks found on \"The Crusade\" made up the last third, starting with \"The World Can't Tear Us Apart\" and \"Tread The Floods.\" \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" is a love ballad delivered by a passionate, beautiful chorus. \"Tread The Floods\" kicks things back into thrash mode and features the lung-stomping double bass that is only outdone by a fantastic solo midway through the song and the guitar riff that introduces it. The relentless chorus is also a strong point, repeating, \"Tread the floods, and you can only see/Your own reality, as fallen as can be/Watch yourself, drown in disarray/It's time to break away, all will die today.\" Soon afterwards is \"The Rising,\" which features a solo that can't go without mention. There is some redundance to that statement, as powerful solos are just another Trivium staple.\"The Crusade,\" which stifles Heafy's voice and ends the album, is an entertaining 8:18 of adventurous metal. This song is really as epic as its name implies and takes the listener on what simply has to be called a magic guitar ride. Eat that, Aladdin.\"The Crusade\" will appeal to Metallica, Megadeath, Motley Crue, and Iron Maiden fans a little more than \"Ascendancy\" fans. The album clocks in relatively close to an hour in length, which has become standard for most metal bands, so there is plenty to keep the 80's metal fan entertained. \"The Crusade\" is currently on sale for an MSRP of $9.99-$11.99 but can be found at $7.99 for a short amount of time after its October 10th, 2006 at Best Buy stores.\n", "val": 0.01673777773976326}
{"text": "Between extensive touring, befriending numerous other bands, and making their new full-length, this young, Orlando-based quartet have barely had a moment's rest since their exceptional breakthrough album, \"Ascendancy,\" arrived in stores in March of 2005. And to make life even more difficult, they decided to have the new album ready in time for a late 2006 release date (less than nineteen months after their previous effort was released). I don't know how they did it, but Trivium managed to find a way to write, rehearse, record and release the new record (entitled \"The Crusade\") in time, and they were even able to make it even better than \"Ascendancy\" (more unique, music-oriented, expansive, and complex). In fact, come year's end, it won't be at all surprising to see this C.D. near the top of more than a few \"Best Of 2006\" lists.Every aspect of Trivium's music has matured and improved by leaps and bounds. In fact, instrumentally speaking, it doesn't get much better than this in metal nowadays. The guitarists stitch together gobs of unexpectedly excellent, professional riffs, strong, propulsive leads that evoke Metallica's heyday (somewhere around 1984's \"Ride The Lightning\" and 1986's \"Master of Puppets\"), and they even come up with an abundance of technical, ripping solos. The drummer (Travis Smith) is more remarkable, too, because his beats appear to be getting more complicated and energetic.Trivium's twenty-year-old frontman, Matt Heafy, probably saw that his band had made some significant improvements, so he, in turn, honed his own skills. His previous vocal style (prototypical metalcore yells) has been almost completely abandoned in favor of a new, low singing (almost crooning) voice that vividly brings the Metallica frontman (James Hatfield) to mind. Heafy also took time to become educated in and inspired by world events, and as a result, his lyrics on \"The Crusade\" are about a hundred times more intelligent, poignant, and thought-provoking. Several songs here take on political or taboo (and extremely morbid) subjects, such as governmental leaders and war (of course!), the spread of the AIDS virus, killing for honor, a nameless woman (Andrea Yates, maybe?) who takes her childrens' lives because she thinks they're possessed, Matthew Shephard's murder, being \"Hellbent\" on world domination, and police corruption (more specifically, the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo).But perhaps what's most impressive about this record is that Trivium are capable of wearing their influences on their sleeves, but they never come across as a terribly unoriginal band. The music evokes thrash's glory days, but it also features a noticeable modern-sounding side (which is apparent in the acoustic mid-section of the opening track and the faint commercial appeal of songs like \"Contempt Breeds Contamination.\") As a whole, \"The Crusade\" sounds something like Metallica's guitar chops wrapped in (old) Testament's melody and topped off with Megadeth-style hooks (circa the \"Rust In Peace\" era).The album opens with five killer cuts. The first two,  \"Ignition\" and \"Revelation,\" combine to produce a great, memorable one-two punch. Crunchy, punching riffs, pounding drum beats, and pulsating rhythms abound here, and the two songs also share five wailing guitar solos. \"Entrance of the Conflagration\" is an intense thrasher that bolsters fiery, dueling guitar leads with busy double bass work. Next, \"Anthem (We Are The Fire)\" is very impressive in how it builds and gains momentum. Much of it is occupied by busy riffing, thumping drums, a propulsive bass line that makes the listener wonder if Dave Ellefson secretly joined the band, and a catchy (though somewhat brief) call-and-response part. The song's climax, a series of mazey solos, is also quite cool. Lastly, \"Unrepentant\" keeps the energy flowing with forceful machine gun drums and more propulsive, twin guitar fireworks.The next two tracks, \"And Sadness Will Sear\" and \"Becoming The Dragon,\" are fairly slow, but \"To The Rats,\" which is a breakneck roller-coaster ride of blistering riffs, kicks the album back into high gear. Track twelve, \"The Rising,\" is also of note for its laid back tempo, melodic leads, irresistibly catchy, lurching rhythm, and powerful, fist-pumping, softly chanting vocals. The lyrics to this song, which deal with unity and rioting, prove to be very inspiring and memorable (they might bounce around your head for a couple days).Finally, the last track, the title song, almost deserves its own review. It's an intricate, brilliantly written instrumental piece that symphonically intermingles numerous different tempos, moods, rhythms, and guitar styles (including fast leads, heavy and melodic riffs, a bass solo, and slow strumming). Some truly stellar musicianship is heard throughout this song, making it a perfect way to end the album.At this point, you might have the impression that \"The Crusade\" is a flawless, timeless classic. Well, it's not -- not quite. One thing that it could have benefitted from is having at least one more explosive, unrestrained, attacking-the-jugular climax. Next, while these guitar solos are generally impressive, they're never very long (twenty seconds is as long they get). And finally, Trivium couldn't fully extinguish every metalcore cliche: the soaring chorus in \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" is sweet and heartfelt, but it's just too trite and unnecessary to work.Is it the next \"Master of Puppets?\" Nah. Is it even the best metal you'll hear this year? Probably not. But you can bet your bottom dollar that \"The Crusade\" is a great, entirely solid album (easily Trivium's best to date), and that it will probably be one of only a handful of \"metalcore\" era discs that you'll still be listening to in ten or even twenty years. It'll likely take several listens before you start hearing this album's genius, but a lot of great albums take time to fully appreciate. This is a realized, well-played, nearly epic release from a talented young band that's clearly just beginning to scratch the surface of its full potential.\n", "val": 0.022537458688020706}
{"text": "When I first heard \"Ascendancy\", I was blown away by Trivium's musicianship and intricate song writing skills.  However, I wasn't too fond of Matt's screaming and growling vocal style.  The sections in the songs where he actually sang were much better, in my opinion.  Now, with \"The Crusade\", Trivium has taken their musicianship to an even higher level.  Matt Heafy is going to be the metal god of the 21st century, and now that he's dropped the screaming vocals, Trivium will soar into the metal stratosphere.  \"The Crusade\" has album of the year written all over it.  If you are a fan of old-school Metallica (I'm not saying they're a clone band), then \"The Crusade\" will ignite fires within your soul that haven't burned since the mid-to-late 80's.

{"text": "Trivium unleashes a metal monster with their latest disc! Looking to further evolve, the band ditched the drop D tuning for this recording and did a good chunk of it in a standard tuning, with Paolo thumping away at a 5 string bass. The album is a great step foward technically in Metal riffage as well as great metal songwriting. They've managed to best labelmates Killswitch Engage. Lot's of great solos that work and fit in the songs, like in \"detonation\" which features a monstorously heavy riff and a crazy guitar solo. This album has some great vocals too, although some fans from the last record may be dissapointed Heafy's not screaming his brain out, but the musicianship on this makes up for it as well as some great harmonized vocals in some chorus' like my favorite in the chorus for \"Unrepentant\". Probably one of the things that makes this record so great is the lyrics are very easy to follow without being stupid or cheesey, they are very much to the point, like in \"TO THE RATS\": \"Break every bone in your face! If you mess with my Life!\". The Lyrics explore a little more what bands really haven't done lately, SOCIAL ISSUES. Without getting too preachy or political, the band opens your eyes to incidents you may not be aware, like the beating of a man left for dead in \"Sadness will Sear\", and an event that happened in New York City in which unarmed man was shot by Police 41 times in \"Contempt breeds Contamination\". Also noteworthy is Trivium's use of 7 strings on a few songs, which is pretty interesting and is a different approach from what you might hear from bands like Unearth. I will say this does cement a Legacy of sorts for this young band. Just remember these guys are in their early 20s, so this is just the beginning!\n", "val": 0.06825612485408783}
{"text": "Harsh vocals of the kind popular in metalcore (not death or black metal) have ruined metal because they've led to everything sounding the same.  The only part of any metalcore song that is truly memorable is the clean course, and even that gets old because the songs always follow the same formula.  This works for a song or two, but over the course of a whole album it fails.  I've always thought bands like All That Remains, Shadows Fall, and God Forbid were great in small doses, but when I tried to listen to an entire album by any of these bands, the utter sameness would ruin the experience for me. I know vocals aren't eveything, but most metalcore bands don't have the musically briallance of a band like Mastodon; therefore, I can't forgive the vocal weakness.  Trivium's Ascendency was a bit more memorable than most metalcore albums, but it wasn't a classic. I had long hoped for a metalcore band to switch completely to clean vocals.  I got that wish with Avenged Sevenfold's last album, but they took it too far and decided to be Guns N Roses.  Thankfully, Trivium realized that the real strength of metalcore was that it was essentially the same thing as 90s thrash, so they made a 90s trash album.  It is not perfect, but it has a number of memorable songs and shows that metal isn't just about harsh vocals.  The truth is we had metal for almost thrity years without \"harsh vocals,\" and metal will be fine without them.  In my opinion, aside from death and black metal bands where a kind of gutteral vocal is essential, \"harsh\" vocals have only been done correctly by one man, Phil Anselmo.\n", "val": 0.00016220365068875253}
{"text": "Trivium in their finest hour can't compare to legends of the past (Metallica, Megadeth, others.) So to make comparisons like that are completely absurd and completely stupid. This album is above average in my opinion. Not a classic by any means, just a very good metal album, one of the best this year. Also check out Mastodons \"Blood Mountain\" and War of Ages \"Pride of the Wicked\", 2 more good metal acts that will carry the metal torch.Trivium has slowly progressed from a simple metalcore act to a superb thrash act, showing signs of breaking away from that trend on Ascendency, incorporating more thrashy and metal elements than their peers. They are now broken farther away from metalcore acts with vocals being tweeked to more of a hardcore/thrash yell/singing. I think this might be their way of weeding out the music fans from the scene kids, start as a simple metalcore act then slowly incorporate REAL music into your songs and see who lasts.Trivium is on the verge of a breakout and if you want to use Metallica termage, this album is Trivium's Ride The Lightning in terms of musical growth I believe. Many may disagree but I think their popularity will decrease because of this album. Most fans won't realize how awesome this album is and jump ship. This is metal kids, whether you like it or not. Metal will never die and Trivium is going to be one of the bands to carry it on.A few things I would like to point out.1)Trivium is 1000x better than most metal acts out there right now. Unlike most of the metalcore acts with super fast chuggin and double bass pedal galore, Trivium uses those techniques to change the tempo and change song structure. The solos are nothing to laugh about either, showing influence of early trash acts like Slayer and Anthrax. Mean licks abound.2) No more gang chants. Track 4 featured a \"whoa Whoa whoa\" gang chant. That is outdated and really really corny. Gang chants were made famous by the stadium rock and glam/hair rock of the 80's, where frequently concerts sucked so they used those to get the crowd into it. Cut it dudes. You're too talented to use those. Let us hear your instruments to get us pumped.3) Drums could be toned down a bit. Sometimes I felt the drums took away from the other instruments (bass could have been turned up a bit, but I'm a bass player there is never too much bass) Guitars are also sometimes drowned by the drums.4) Give em one or two more albums. They have almost got it. I'm really looking forward to what Trivium will bring us in the future.\n", "val": 0.006089004687964916}
{"text": "This is where Trivium needed to go--straying away from the metalcore and embracing its thrash roots. It's hard to find a weak spot on this album. Great musicianship throughout...I personally would have liked to hear a little more screaming, but it's certainly not as big of a deal as others are making it out to be.Overall, a great step forward for the band. This sets the scene for a very intriguing fourth offering.\n", "val": 0.04964429885149002}
{"text": "First off I have never been a Trivium fan before this album.  This might be the album that erases Nu-Metal and Metalcore and that is a good thing IMO.  Everybody has there own tastes and if you want to listen to that type of music it will always be avaiable in the underground but it's high time REAL METAL is brought back to the forefront and Trivium seems like the band willing to lead the charge!!!This album proudly showcases what makes real metal so great and superior to false metal.  Ripping guitar solo's executed unapologetically and often. Real sung vocals devoid of unneccesary screaming or hardcore shouts.  I know some people like this, but that is metalcore, Trivium has turned into a real metal/thrash band and it was a wise decision to drop these silly trends from there music.  The vox are awesome by Heafy because he still sings aggressively so as to fit the heavy thrash music, and the need for cookie monster's apperance in not needed.  I always wondered why some band did not try the old Hetfield approach to vox and just sing in an aggressive tone instead of scream and shout.  Finally someone has.  Thanks Matt!Songs like 'Entrance of the Conflagration' and 'Detonation' totally remind me of Master of Puppets era Metallica and that is so refreshing to hear again.  The Choruses of 'Ignition' and 'This World Can't tear us Apart' showcase Trivium's melodic sense.  While songs like 'Tread the Floods' and 'The Crusade' showcase the bands technical ability that blows away the 3 chord altenative bands of the grunge 90's.  Finally the 'Anthem' is a fun song that despite a little cheesiness kinda sounds like an anthem for Real Metal's Triumphant and Pround Return!Band's like Nevermore, Evergrey, Tad Morose, Iced Earth, Brainstorm, and Primal Fear just to name a few, have been carring the flag for true metal for some time.  Unfortunately, they have been relagated to the underground due to bigger labels owning the marketing media.  I think Trivium will pave the way for all of these bands to explode out of the underground and into the mass acceptance of true metal.  They have the big label backing them and the skills to prove it.  They might just be the New Old Metallica????\n", "val": 0.07261217385530472}

Comparing \"The Crusade\" to Metallica and Megadeth is a great compliment, but completely wrong.  If you just like metal and / or hard rock guitar with piercing leads, driving bass and creatively intense double bass drumming, get The Crusade, and you will not have any regrets.  If you want an \"old Trivium formula\" CD, buy \"The Crusade\" anyway, and you will learn to like the \"new\" Trivium, sooner or later.  Trivium has always been very good, but with this CD they have finally transcended to great.  Some of my favorite CDs have probably not even reached 100,000 in sales, but \"The Crusade\" will go Platinum, plus.  I'm getting a half dozen for \"friends & family\" right now.

{"text": "so trivium has evolved into a late 80's early 90's thrash band....not a bad thing but i've heard this before and i've heard this better. I hear alot of similarities between this and the latest perzonal war album \"when times turn red\", only that disc was more instantly memorable. still that said Trivium play with plenty of fire and conviction,they definately have the skills to convince. musically this cd reminds me much of megadeth and overkill...while the vocals are almost a complete James Hetfield knock off...but who cares...James Hetfield hasn't sounded this good in 15 years...so what is wrong with the album, well honestly not alot...there are a few filler tracks...especially the track \"Anthem\"...which for some reason was selected as the single... and to be honest while I prefer the new vocal approach, I wish that they hadn't just abandoned the harshness of their previous albums...maybe a bit more crossing up...it would definately make for a less monotonous vocal performance. yet all in all, this album is a good listen, and worth a purchase, don't expect anything stunning, and ground breaking, but this is good enough to get the fists pumping... if you want some good newer thrash, check out Shatter Messiah, Perzonal war, After All, and Susperia\n", "val": 0.03771239519119263}

{"text": "Let's remove the entire Metallica factor in this. Sure, they sound similar to Metallica, but that's not why this album is bad. This album is bad because it doesn't sound good. Now, I know a lot of people might think that it DOES sound good. Your entitled to your opinion but I honestly think it's trash. This isn't the gripping metal it was before. I like Trivium's old CDs. Maybe because I like metal. This new album has lost the little brutality of their old CDs. Not just because Heafy doesn't scream anymore, but because the riffs are so light. The drumming lost it's intensity. It's not the Trivium that I liked. I love every minute of the first two albums. This is simply dissappointing to me because I was expecting the same Trivium from Ascendancy. Sure, you can say they've \"evolved\" into something new and better but that's just it. They haven't. They've \"DE-volved\" into old metal. Not that that's a bad thing. It's just that it doesn't SOUND good. And oh yes, I love Metallica. Heafy may sing like Hetfield, but no, this isn't anywhere near the level Metallica reached. This is a crowd-pleaser album. Nothing more. And for some, it's worked. You've bought into it.The lyrics have lost their emotion. What the point if you can't understand the lyrics? I'd rather not understand the lyrics if the lyrics are so depthless it makes me want to puke. But besides that, when he screamed the lyrics, at least he had the depth and emotion that I expected from him.But they're just evolving from the repetative metalcore scene? First of all, to evolve, you need to become in some sense, better than before. And for many Trivium fans, this is not a step up. This is not old Trivium.I'm an old Trivium fan. I must say, I did not like this album. It was boring. I didn't even notice the transition between songs because I lost interest. So, for many old Trivium fans, this is not for you. This is not metalcore. This is an attempt at 80s thrash metal, which I must say wasn't very well done in comparison to bands that actually played in the 80s.Oh and I'd just like to make a quick comment on the \"kid\" who posted before. You seem very offended that someone who listens to Papa Roach and Linkin Park would touch this album. In fact, I think I see a stereotypical comment :). I must say though, don't you find it a little bit pathetic to delve into someone's reviewer history in order to insult them? I think you have too much free time.

{"text": "Trivium returns with an insane album that is sure to divide its long-time fans.  Musically as intense, intricate and thrashy as ever, The Crusade finds vocalist Matt Heafy sounding a lot like vintage James Hetfield, a significant departure from his more brutal screaming on previous efforts.  It's quite the change, and it's certain to distract some listeners into thinking the album isn't any good simply beacuse it doesn't sound like \"old\" Trivium.Others will argue that change is good and necessary, and that a band as talented as this shouldn't simply release the same album over and over.  And that Heafy's vocals, as impressive as they were on albums one and two, had a tendency to wear on you by disc's end.I stand firmly in the second camp.  The vocal style works for me, and there's still bits and pieces of \"dry\" singing throughout to add some welcome variety.  Trivium clearly appreciate the founders of 80s thrash, and this album stands as a testament to the Metallicas and Megadeths of the world.  Think an album of consistent, quality songs like ...And Justice for All or Rust in Peace.  If you dig the songwriting on and feel of those albums, this is your kinda disc.Special mention should be made to the lyrical topics addressed on The Crusade.  Topics include racism and racial profiling, sexism, homophobia, the war in Iraq, corrupt public policy, what a patriot can (and cannot) say, and mental illness (sometimes for entire songs, sometimes in a line here and there).  The band shows an impressive will to speak out on issues important to them.All in all, a welcome addition to the Trivium catalog.  Sure to divide some, but also sure to amaze many.\n", "val": 0.023672915995121002}
{"text": "Yes like everyone is saying this sounds a bit like Metallica, and Trivium now sounds as gay as Matt Heafy looks. Their last CD Ascendancy was very good and help popularize Trivium. Now they are going where the money is.  Matt has droped the harsh vocals to sound very much like James Hetfield.  This will undeniably appeal to a much wider audience as the vocals are a lot friendlier to non metal heads.Trivium is however very talented, all members of the band are very good musicians and The Crusade does have some very good thrash riffs and memorable moments.  But seriously one of those emo-fags could sing better that this.  I have tried numerous times to listen and like this CD but the vocals completely ruin it for me. Ascendancy's vocals were just right, harsh but not painfull to listen to and you could make out the words without reading along.

Just because of some of the similarities and just the way they made their entrance into metal. Even though they may be similar to Metallica, they had a uniqueness to them, particularly because of the difference in the singing. Then Trivium took part in a tribute album to Metallica and made a cover to \"Master of Puppets\". The cover was amazing, it sounded just like Metallica's song, especially since the singer sounded exactly like James Hetfield. It was a good job by Trivium, but it all went downhill from there. The band spend a lot of time with Metallica and now produced the album i am reviewing. The music in this album is somewhat identical to Trivium's past two albums. But the singer sounds exactly like James Hetfield still. He has completely abandoned his old unique singing style. The is a huge loss to the music of Trivium. Some may think... \"Metallica...it would be great if they sounded even more like Metallica.\" Well it might've been to some people, but it won't only because it still does not sound anywhere near as good as Metallica was. With all of that said, the only song i somewhat enjoyed was \"Tread the Floods\". Nevertheless i still encourage Trivium lovers (like me) to listen to a couple songs on this album so you can at least know what they have done to themselves.

'Ooh, La La' features some of the best work from Giorgio Moroder and his incredible studio team. Wonderful songs are delivered in complex, layered productions. Suzi Lane sounds fresh, knowing and confident. The first three tracks run seamlessly, as they did on vinyl. The sounds range from classic Giorgio-style tension on \"Ooh, La La\" (great phasing sax!) to a tropics-tinged urgency in \"Givin' It Up,\" to \"No One Home In The City's\" rock guitar direction. The songs on \"Side Two\" (tracks 4, 5 and 6) are separated, as on the album. \"Morning, Noon and Night\" has a current of uncertainty throbbing beneath its surface sentiment of devoted love and \"Free Me\" ends the album on an upbeat, empowering tone.\"Harmony\" is elegance. Sophisticated, deliberate, hymnal and stately, it stands with Candi Staton's \"Victim\" and Gino Soccio's \"Dancer\" in an elite group of graceful, polished, dignified disco classics. Everything comes together perfectly in this song; everything works. Everything.The sound quality is generally excellent. The only negative I've noticed is uneven left side dips/dropouts on \"Morning, Noon and Night.\"The cover art and photos have never been so luminous. Informative liner notes return to the album's 1979 release, introducing and answering many  questions about the elusive Suzi Lane (Suzilene McDonald) through an extensive interview, and author David Ybarra explores the intersection of Suzi, Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer, with enlightening comments from Chris Bennett. His broad ranging discussion is entertaining and unexpectedly challenging. You may or may not agree with his perspectives, but you will listen to this album and other referenced songs with new insight. This is one of Gold Legion's best booklets. Song lyrics are also included. [One boner by the package designer: an inner jewel box photo of Suzi, Giorgio and two women (is that you, Chris Bennett?) living the good life poolside, obscures precisely the faces of Suzi and Giorgio with the circular CD spindle.

{"text": "\"We hope you will be willing to bat this music around, turn it inside out, caress and pound it, question it, and we hope that something of value, something unexpected remains.\" ~ Tierney Sutton ~The Tierney Sutton Band takes some of the best-loved standards from the Great American Songbook and elevates them to a more creative and innovative level of renditions. The end-result is a truly wonderful album that can be enjoyed for all the years to come. Ms. Sutton is a singer of a-rare-form who consistently lends finesse and elegance to all the songs she interprets. Underneath that beautiful voice is a line-up of incredible musicians such as Christian Jacob (piano), Ray Brinker (drums), Trey Henry and Kevin Axe (bass).On the very first time I listened to this remarkable album, I forwarded it to track six, set it on repeat mode and listened endlessly before listening to the rest of the tracks. I was simply moved and blown away by her impressive delivery of \"Then I'll Be Tired Of You,\" a great song from the pens of two brilliant songwriters America has ever known, E.Y. Hamburg and Arthur Schwartz. She has made it her very own and given it the retire-the-trophy treatment. Likewise, she gives this nearly-forgotten song a new lease on life and made it alive again. Her interpretation is the best-ever. She even bested Ella's, Sarah's and Peggy's versions of this rarely-recorded, one of my favorites and was once my song for my ex-hubby (so it is very special - it evokes fond, cherished and hauntingly beautiful memories). Accompanied only by Christian Jacob's striking chops on piano, she has conveyed the true essence of the song in a very simple delivery yet utterly gorgeous. Kudos to Ms. Sutton and Mr. Jacob for the most exquisite interpretation ever recorded, bar none. This alone is worth the price of admission. A charming twenty-second piano intro is heard prior to Ms. Sutton's heart-stopping rendition that is so full of heartfelt emotion and tender perfection...\"I'll be tired of youWhen stars are tired of gleamingWhen I am tired of dreamingThen I'll be tired of youThis I know is trueWhen winds are tired of blowingWhen grass is tired of growingThen I'll be tired of youBeyond the years till day is nightTill wrong is right, till birds refuse to singBeyond the years the echo of my only loveMust still be whispering, whisperingAnd if my throbbing heartShould ever start repeatingThat it is tired of beatingThen I'll be tired of you\"The band cleverly treats the material with overwhelming inventiveness yet staying true to the spirit of each song. The arrangements are exceptional and the interpretations are sublime. Ms. Sutton's artistry is defined by her clarity of vocals, flawless diction and excellent phrasing. The musicians' instrumentations are, as always, top-notch and beautifully-executed.I never thought that there will be a version as gorgeous as Ella Fitzgerald's \"Then I'll Be Tired Of You\" or Sarah Vaughan's \"Whatever Lola Wants\" or Peggy Lee's \"Fever\" or Julie London's \"Cry Me A River\" or Dianne Reeves' \"Skylark\" or Billie Holiday's \"Love Me Or Leave Me,\" but she proves me wrong on that notion. With her exquisite renditions, she gives these songs new meanings and fresh styles. She now shares the ownership of such songs with the aforementioned jazz divas, with the exception of \"Then I'll Be Tired Of You\" - she made it a gem of a song, hence, she is now the sole owner.The beauty of this album is that it stays interesting to the end - there's never a dull moment listening to it in its entirety. I'm totally jazzed! There's nothing left to be desired in an album.With my heartfelt recommendation.\n", "val": 0.03127286583185196}
{"text": "Tierney Sutton is the closest thing amongst jazz vocalists we have to John Coltrane.  By that, I mean that she and her band's music, consisting of unique interpretations of standards, has evolved over the years to the spiritual.  This was apparent in the Band's last release, the wonderful \"On the Other Side.\"  Now it is overt.  This c.d. is to the Tierney Sutton Band like \"A Love Supreme\" was to Coltrane.The c.d. begins with a quote from the Hidden Words of Baha'ullah.  You may ask:  What on earth does that have to do with standards from the '30's?  And the Tierney Sutton Band answers the question quickly:  If love of the supreme being is the one true love, then everything else is a paper moon, hanging over a cardboard sea....And so it goes.  Whereas \"On the Other Side\" was about the pursuit of happiness, this c.d. is about desire, or the pursuit of the pursuit of happiness.  As such, some of what's here is in shifting, ragged tempos followed by breaks into a 4/4 swing (as in \"It's All Right With Me,\" \"Love Me or Leave Me\" and \"Cry Me A River.\")  Or, you may hear sinewy, insinuating bass obligatos from Trey Henry and Kevin Axt, setting forth a suffocatingly seductive vibe (e.g., \"Whatever Lola Wants\" and \"Fever\").  Or, you may hear ballads done sort of straight, but with an indelible tinge of regret over missed opportunity (e.g., \"Long Daddy Green\" or \"Heart's Desire,\" or \"Then I'll Be Tired of You.\")  I.e., in varying musical modes, you have desire presented as \"tension and release.\"Or you may hear the most brilliant cover ever of \"Skylark,\" beginning with another recital from sacred Baha'I text, followed by Christian Jacob's ethereal, other-worldly piano comping.  A poem to the heavens.  Whereas the set begins with a frantic Ray Brinker in 7/8 over a timeless rest of the band on \"Paper Moon,\" it ends thusly.  The standards have broken free of their usual restrictions and have ascended to heaven.  And that is what desire can do.This c.d. is both heady and brilliant.  I think it's the Tierney Sutton Band's best, and that's saying a lot.  What a wonderful, thought-provoking album this is!  RC\n", "val": 0.004408952780067921}
{"text": "It would be best to listen to this somewhat atypical Sutton album three times: first, to hear and quickly judge from prior experience; second, to analyze more critically; and third to just stop thinking and actually listen without prejudgments or analysis. It would best to do the last way first, but sometimes we need to train the ear. Hence, I had doubts initially but at the end realized that this is a very fine, not perfect, group of recordings. Paper Moon and Fever are stunningly good and most others are nicely interpreted, with performances that grab attention. The band has its particularly rich moments, and special kudos to bassist Kevin Axt's key lines. Although several tunes do not succeed for me, the album grows on you, and if you have other Tierney Sutton recordings, you will need to obtain this album where Sutton stretches into the slow, thoughtful ballad.\n", "val": 0.01727895997464657}
{"text": "Any album by the Tierney Sutton Band can be relied upon to be worthwhile, but the band has outdid itself with this amazing album.  This work can be open to multiple interpretations, as it looks both at humanity's best and basest desires.  The opening song, \"It's Only a Paper Moon\", when coupled with a spiritual reading from the Bahai faith and a slight change in lyrics, becomes almost meditative.  The closing song, \"Skylark\", soars.  In between, \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\" loses any of the innocence that the original may have possessed.  Tierney puts her own mark on the often interpreted songs like \"It's All Right with Me\", \"Fever\", and \"Cry Me a River\".  The lesser known \"Long Daddy Green\" becomes a fascinating commentary on fortune and fate.Of course, the Tierney Sutton Band has been working together about 15 years, and it shows - they are one of the tightest vocalist-lead groups around.  Their contributions certainly add to the reinterpretations of these songs.  Compare Christian Jacob's frenetic accompaniment in \"Whatever Lola Wants\" to the soaring chords of \"Skylark\".This is a CD that will hold up to many listenings and it should be a contender for Jazz Vocalist of the Year.\n", "val": 0.005843861028552055}
{"text": "Five MARVELOUS Stars!! A STELLAR Grammy-nominated musical look at desire and temptation. For a decade and an half,  jazz diva Tierney Sutton's highly creative band has been one of jazz' longer-running small ensembles. Some of her CDs are thematic, such as the Bill Evans tribute<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Blue-in-Green/dp/B00005N581/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Blue in Green</a>and the sideways glance of<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/On-the-Other-Side/dp/B000LV6RBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">On the Other Side</a>of love (\"Get Happy\" as a dirge was both daring and effective). This highly enjoyable CD can also be looked at from the 'spiritual thematic point of view' decrying the seductive dangers of fame and fortune or even as homage' from one of today's certified young jazz divas to past singing stars like Peggy Lee (Fever), Carmen McRae (Skylark) and Julie London (Cry Me a River). Lady Day, Abbey, June, Betty, and Ella also come to mind. As usual, Ms Sutton is a cohesive member of her talented, somewhat instrumentally unusual quintet, as in the title of another CD called<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/I-m-with-the-Band/dp/B000A8AXHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">I'm with the Band</a>. Versatile pianist Christian Jacob, drummer Ray Brinker (who is on fire) and 2 inventive bassists: Kevin Axt  & Trey Henry who work well together on the bottom, round out the five spots. These 5 take some familiar standards into new fiery frameworks and multi-rhythmic setups, often shifting gears in flight out of serene starts to dizzying heights and back again (e.g. the smoldering \"Love Me or Leave Me\").The 'best of the best' begins with a beautiful 7 minute exposition of \"It's Only A Paper Moon\" which starts with a spiritual poem over an urgent Ray Brinker beat. That effectively contrasts with Tierney's out of tempo rhapsodic vocalizing which then leads to a burning in-tempo Christian Jacob solo with Brinker pouring on the heat with his brushes. A sensational \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\" again has the urgent beat and voice, as the song takes on a celestial meaning for the word \"Daddy\" as Brinker's accents and rimshots burn behind Tierney's and Jacob's sizzling highly-stylized solos. The two bassists also effectively use differing pizzicato roles on the bottom and in the arrangements. \"Long Daddy Green\" switches the \"Daddy\" word and performance to something more seductive. \"Fever\" escapes Julie London's spell as Tierney puts her stamp on it, bending, twisting, and chopping the notes. \"It's All Right With Me\" is a smoky experience. Even the insistent multi-tracked \"Whatever Lola Wants\" bends to Tierney's musical will, as does \"Skylark\". Tierney Sutton & Band prove it's all about the emphasis & crank up another BIG Winner. DON'T trust the song samples, they don't give a hint of the exhilarating flights that await beyond the intros. Stunning performances!! My Highest Recommendation. Five ENJOYABLE Stars.

{"text": "I find myself coming back to listen over and over.The Buddha says that desire is the root of all suffering. Tierney and group come roaring back with their latest \"Desire\". An album of thoughtful understated meditations on the materialist extremes and Spiritual bankruptcy of the last few years of the stock markets, people buying houses, cars and junk they could never afford, excessive optimism, the Financial Community and their free market idealogs who thru their greed and stupidity destroyed the Wealth of Nations.Excess Desire. \"Long Daddy Green\" and \"Paper Moon\" are cases in point, without sounding preachy she gets her point subtlely across. \"Fever\", \"Whatever Lola Wants\" and \"My Heart belongs to Daddy\" are less about the usual sexual topic than desire. Desire for everything!There are a few places that disturb the flow, a beat like a migrane headache coming on, but these are done on purpose to emphasize the overall theme. And this is a theme album.For my money Tierney Sutton and group are the leading edge of jazz vocal. Technically she's arguable the best in the business. Her only potential problem, witness her last album \"I'm with the Band\", is a tendency to overreach technically, do wierd or difficult things for effect and shortchange the emotional, especially that emotional connection with her audience. \"Desire\" is a big improvement, emotional without excess technical display.The overall mood is wistful, the music is tuneful. The prodings of conscience. The dark album ends on the hopeful note of \"Skylark\".The recording quality and image are excellent.\n", "val": 0.017122207209467888}

This CD is for the sophisticated ear and the courageous fan of jazz.Whether one listens to Tierney in person, with a superb-sound-system, or on the car radio, we are guaranteed a top-notch performance, but DESIRE soars higher in the jazz stratosphere, and makes one wonder just how can these marvelous musicians ever top this mighty endeavor...but with all this amazing talent, I desire their next work-of-art, while savoring this CD surely worthy of a Grammy or two.\n", "val": 0.02735026553273201}
{"text": "The Tierney Sutton Band continues to reawaken my interest of songs from the past and under the heading of smooth jazz at it's most refined level.  This album reflects for me what they are able to do like no other as a group, which is putting fresh air and incomparable balance to songs like \"Paper Moon\" or \"Fever\" and give rebirth to them.  This collection of songs are Ballads from my recollection, and for me seem very reminiscent of songs that come from an era of the late 60's and early 70's, which reflect the ideals of individualism and non-materialistic values.  This was a time when I was most influenced by people like Simon and Garfunkel, and Joni Mitchell.  Furthermore, I am a consumer with classical and early music training, and  late to real appreciation of  jazz . Their body of work helps to bring together a sound I am most enthusiastic for in the appreciation of all well crafted music. I hear how they share standards that embody all great music of the past.

This is not \"background music.\" Rather, this is subtle, elegant, creative and, at times, powerfully moving vocal jazz that only gets better with repeated listenings.\"Desire\" comes across as a powerful, even spiritual, musical statement about the nature of human desire, both good and bad, which is just what Tierney and the band had in mind, according to the liner notes. Not one arrangement here is predictable or pedestrian, and the support from pianist Christian Jacob and the rest of the band is, as always, superb. What these musicians do with these tunes, some of them \"shop-worn standards,\" is both remarkable and beautiful. Tierney has a way of conveying irony and other subtle shadings of meaning in her singing of the lyrics that is not often heard. In my opinion, Tierney is the best living female jazz singer.

{"text": "After being introduced to Break of Reality through a track on this album (Vintage), I instantly fell in love with the band.  Unlike many other primarily string bands, which mostly do covers (a la 2chellos, Vitamin String Quartet, The Section Quartet, etc.), these guys write all their own music.  One of the best things about this is how much they experiment and play around with different musical stylings.  This is most obvious in Anodynia 2 and to some extent Che.The one complain I have with this album is that, unlike their last The Sound Between, BoR chose not to include a second cd of acoustic tracks in addition to their main album. This is a very minor complaint, however, and not enough to take away a 5 star rating.Overall, the music here is absolutely phenomenal and I would recommend it to any fan of this kind of music, and possibly non-fans as well!\n", "val": 0.01974540948867798}

{"text": "Upon listening to the eagerly anticipated third CD release from Break of Reality, I find myself in familiar territory with this quartet's music.  On first run through, I'm trying to determine in which direction the music is taking me.  On my second listen, I think I'm beginning to understand where they are headed.  And by the next time I run through these ten incredible tracks, all I can say is \"take me along for the ride BoR - I get it\"!  Be prepared for a unique emotional journey with \"Spectrum of the Sky\".No other group that I can recall in recent history has elicited such a broad range of emotions from their music.  Is it the absence of a vocalist that allows your own mind to decipher what the music means to you?  Is it the gut wrenching timbre of the cello, the weaving of so many different harmonies, or possibly the impact of the intense percussional variations?  Break of Reality has really come into its own with this collection of songs.  When you listen to \"Spectrum\" for the first time, one thing is perfectly clear - Break of Reality has a very serious and distinct purpose in mind from the first track, right to the very end.  Coupled with stellar audio quality, the disc won't be leaving your rotation for a long, long time. This CD has so many stand-out tracks that it's difficult to highlight just a few.  The title cut \"Spectrum of the Sky\" is an immediate draw.  A captivating introduction leads into a typically enticing BoR lick that will be running through your mind for days.  But the song's sojourns into haunting percussion lines and rain-spattered cello harmonics has at least this listener traveling though Europe by train only to awaken to the sunny, yet tender \"Comfortable Silence\" where you will want to remain for a period of time far longer than this song permits.  You will be transfixed by the percussional intensity of \"The Accidental Death of Effie\" and \"Che\" as well as the sonorous beauty of the cellos' harmonic travels into the far reaching corners of fear and anger, anticipation and joy, as you integrate \"The Farewell\" and \"Vintage\" into your internal musical biorhythm.But it's the four movement composition \"Anodynia\" that shines the brightest and presages the significant potential of this young ensemble.  A suite originally commissioned for Music and Dance, \"Anodynia\" melds cello and additional percussive instrumentation with such auditory precision that the listener is literally left breathless.  The journey that Break of Reality has created for you will take you through pain and anguish, disembodiment and reflection, but will leave you fulfilled both musically and spiritually.  The varied colors and textures of this music will enrich you in many ways, but most importantly this CD will allow you to dream.  Spectrum of the Sky indeed.\n", "val": 0.0138640021905303}

Jane Lanier, Michael Paternostro and Alex  Sanchez (Steam Heat) transpose quite well on CD, and so does Big Spender  and Mr. Bojangles. But nothing compares to the dazzling rendition of the  \"Big Deal\" classic, Life's a Bowl of Cherries, performed by the  stellar, beautiful, talented and gracious Valarie Pettiford, who, with this  performance may have failed to snag a Tony, but solidified the strong hold  she has on her fan's admiration and won the heart of a new generation of  spectators who had yet to discover the wonder that is Ms. Pettiford.\n", "val": 0.008897381834685802}

{"text": "Although the show far exceeds the CD in the thrill and joy that it brings, the album still provides a lot for those who can not find recordings of some of these songs on other albums.  Ralph Burns's orchestrations alone  are superb.  I have listened to the original orchestrations from shows like  Sweet Charity, Pippin and Chicago as well as \"All that Jazz\"  and  I was thrilled to find how hard Burns has worked to create a different  style with his work from the originals.  The album also packs some of the  strongest and most enjoyable vocal talents I've ever encountered on a  Broadway recording.  The voices are real and not are of the phony angelic  opera-based type found in many other broadway recordings.  Vallerie  Pettiford's rendition of \"Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries\" alone  is enough to give this album 5 stars.  Again, it is a bigger thrill to see  these songs performed on stage, but for what it is, the album is definitly  a gem.As for the numbers that were cut, I wanted them to include the  \"mein Herr\" number, which is also performed by pettiford, but I  suppose it's hard to get the rights to reproduce all of these songs and  print them.  Since the rights to all of these musicals are owned by  different companies, RCA would have had to go through all of them to get  the copyright. some may have agreed to the stage performance but not the  album.All in all, I highly recomend this album.\n", "val": 0.02745985798537731}

I do agree with some reviews that Amazon should've gave a warning about the song, but there is a preview here so don't blame Amazon.  I really can't stop smirking about what a prank this has been to those with closed minds yet they \"like\" Lady Gaga!

It goes on and on, each cut slicing back another part of Otis' genius.  \"Dreams to Remember\" may well be the greatest song he composed --  and he composed many. The backing of his long time studio cohorts is  sensational -- Steve Cropper's minimalist twangings compliment Otis' vocals  superbly. I'm a rather tough critic, even on my favorite performers, but  this is about as good as r&b ever got.\n", "val": 0.045407749712467194}
{"text": "Otis Redding's passing and the appropriation of the original Stax catalog in 1967 was the biggest one-two punch out southern soul probably ever endured during it's orginal run in the mid to late 60's. Even so it would appear that up to the very end Otis Redding was musically prolific and moving in new directions even. One of the elements that characterizes this album is how Redding,long thought of as more of an interpretive singer actually emphasizes his excellent songwriting here and throws down some real showstoppers such as the deeply funky \"Hard To Handle\"-a tune that has not only been covered from everyone from Tom Jones to The Black Crowes but provides the important link between the sound of Stax in the 60's and what Al Green would do a few years later with the Hi sound,minus some of the light orchestration. He even follows up another one of his classics in \"The Happy Song\",a more upbeat and chorded variation on \"Fa Fa Fa Fa (Sad Song)\" from earlier.  The only cover tune here would have to be \"A Fool For You\",originally a bluesy Ray Charles hit which for this offering really brings out that country churchy/gospel cry in Otis's voice-pleading and preaching rather than confessing in Charles. The album likewise concludes with his version of \"Amen\",which becomes a gospel medley in Reddings hands. One of the things,listening to this album today is that it shows you how much-especially in the hands of people such as James Brown and Curtis Mayfield how much soul and R&B made a very big about face rhythmically;from being more a vocal medium with some elements closer to rock and roll to the complex rhythmic patterns of the different funk and jazz hybrids of the genres in the next decade. Now in more recent years this kind of \"deep 60's soul\" has become the basis for much of the retro music in R&B. All the same it should be noted if Redding had lived he'd have even progressed so this music was likely the transitional element in a change he was planning to make rather than another variation on a theme. So in the end there's much to get excited about here.\n", "val": 0.007338142488151789}

{"text": "Crossover night for Otis took place in June 1967 at Monterey where he garnered a whole new audience. He provided insight to the \"Love Crowd\" from the universe in which he emerged. After that show he redefined himself and set out to stretch his music and had created an amalgamation of disparate styles while still extolling the virtues of R&B tradition. Most evident is that he was incorporating more rock and tackling funk into his music than what came before. Yet these brilliant song structures have the same economy and clarity.This is a masterpiece diffused with personal introspection. He's forged an individual sound with the responsive backing unit of Booker T. & The MGs' and the Mar-Keys. This is a crucial collaboration in which every musician has empathy towards the material and this can be attributed to their unity.The tricky key changes and brass arrangements seem to amplify the desire in the lyrics. The use of the stop-start break on \"Nobody's Fault But Mine\" is an ideal touch. Otis's rough-and-ready baritone elevates the spirit of each song and it's revealing in its totality. His delicacy of expression on \"Think About It\" complements its pointed analysis. He's playful on the suggestive \"Hard To Handle\". The poignancy in his voice on \"I've Got Dreams To Remember\" is truly gut-wrenching. An extraordinary revival of \"Amen\" is straight out of a country Georgia church as though Otis was baptizing new lives. On the readymade classic \"The Happy Song (Dum-Dum)\", he weaves a narrative with his subtle humor as he devilishly gloats. This song stands as my absolute favorite in his entire canon.This towering figure in American Soul Music bestowed a beautiful gift and the world is better off for it. This is an eminently powerful draft of his final recordings and a true find.\n", "val": 0.029418855905532837}
{"text": "The only regret you have listening to Otis Redding is how abruptly and tragically his work was abbreviated. As important as his work is,  to not only American soul but all music, he was really  was just getting started when he died in a 1967 plane crash.This album, obviouly released after, shows Otis making great soul music and doing what he always had--progressing by leaps and bounds and taking the entire art with him on his mammouth shoulders.  The music here is getting harder, funkier, the riffs more sharply cut, such as on \"No Body's Fault But Mine,\" which Led Zepplin mutated for Presense.Not only soul--although it is its definition--these are also the gritty ingrediants of funk, which people like George Clinton would brew with Hendrix to make the psychadelic funk of the counterculture.If Redding would have partaken in this, you really, really have to wonder, but in and of itself, his work is both everything, and not nearly enough.\n", "val": 0.0034437670838087797}

There is definitely more going on in his music than you will get with Motown. Otis is like the Led Zeppelin of soul, the heaviest and hardest but not quite as famous as the Beatles.

{"text": "On November 10, 1967, soul music's version of \"The Day The Music Died\" happened. A plane crashed in Lake Monona near Madison, Wisconsin. Aboard were soul star Otis Redding & 4 members of the band The Bar-Kays. All but one Bar-Kays member perished in the crash. Otis, then on the verge of breaking through to pop audiences, was only 26 at the time. Naturally, with his death, unreleased recordings were released posthumously, probably more as a tribute to him than as a last-ditch attempt to cash in on his name. 1968's THE IMMORTAL OTIS REDDING was one of those rare posthumous albums that didn't tarnish the career Otis had worked so hard to build.\"[Sittin' On] The Dock Of The Bay\", of course, was recorded just 3 days before Otis' death & became the first posthumous #1 hit of the rock era. It seemed that Otis was more popular in death than he was alive. The DOCK OF THE BAY album (1968) had its share of previously unreleased songs that were later released & became hits. Apparently, Otis was quite prolific, for the songs kept pouring out afterward & the appropriately-titled THE IMMORTAL OTIS REDDING is just even more icing on the cake.Unlike his absolute best album (and one of the greatest ever made) OTIS BLUE (1965), which mostly contained covers, IMMORTAL has more originals on it, proving Otis was just as accomplished a writer in his own right (he did, after all, write \"Respect\"!). The truly moving \"I've Got Dreams To Remember\" (#41 pop, #6 R&B)was co-written by Otis with his wife Zelma & considering that his death was just around the corner, it's enough to bring a tear to the listener's eye. The same goes for the traditional (but swingingly arranged by Otis) \"Amen\" (#36 pop, #15 R&B), which had been a hit for the Impressions 5 years earlier. Otis' version is just as heartfelt & proof that he hadn't forgotten his raising as a child of the church.Other somber tunes that didn't become hits include \"A Waste Of Time\" (a forgotten masterpiece of Southern soul), \"Champagne & Wine\", \"You Made A Man Out Of Me\", Ray Charles' \"A Fool For You\" & \"Think About It\". This is definitely perfect midnight music to either mend your broken heart or give the one you love a little somethin' (wink wink).But while Otis may be an expert at loving up a storm, he still has the equal ability at getting the listener up & moving. \"Hard To Handle\" (#51 pop, #38 R&B) was no doubt exposed to a new audience thanks to the Black Crowes' 1990 revival & I was even surprised to find that it was a cover. While the Crowes' version is just as much their own, Otis' version still moves like hell. \"Nobody's Fault But Mine\" (B-side to \"Dreams)\", \"A Thousand Miles Away\" & \"The Happy Song\" (#25 pop, #10 R&B) work just as well at bringing up the dullest of parties.While the digging up of a deceased artist's unreleased material would border on the obscene & darn near disrespectful, with Otis Redding, it was clear that the music he hadn't released yet or still intended to work on further was just as good (and, in some cases, better) than what did get released. In fact, Otis had so much music left in the can, that 4 posthumous albums were released & the verdict is that it was indeed worth it (can anyone tell me if LOVE MAN has ever been released on CD?). THE IMMORTAL OTIS REDDING proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that while Otis may have left us at only 26, his music is indeed immortal & that probably he had plans to dazzle us with even more great music. Now, we can only wonder.\n", "val": 0.0059245890006423}

{"text": "\"Nobody Does It Better\" by Marvin Hamlisch and Carole Bayer Sager gets the royal treatment here from Carly Simon--and what a power ballad it is! This was an excellent theme song for the 1977 James Bond movie entitled \"The Spy Who Loved Me.\" From the very beginning with that stunning solo piano arrangement to the very last note, Carly Simon and these musicians couldn't have done this ballad any better!The lyrics are wonderful, too--they are about a man who has quite a hold on his woman who adores him and who truly believes that \"nobody does it better;\" \"nobody does it half as good as you\" and \"Baby, baby, darlin', you're the best.\" True, there's a tiny hint that the woman would like to not be quite so mesmerized by her man with the lyrics \"And nobody does it better / Though sometimes I wish someone could / Nobody does it quite the way you do / Why'd you have to be so good?\" but this thought it never seriously entertained because \"There's some kind of magic inside you / That keeps me from runnin' / But just keep it comin' / How'd you learn to do the things you do?\"This has got to be one of the best songs I've ever heard. I never get tired of it and Carly Simon's version is easily my favorite! I highly recommend this ballad.\n", "val": 0.03541365638375282}

But for Kelly Clarkson, she honestly hasn't been able to make music sound all her own so well. That actually is proof of her latest single, Already Gone, the 3rd single from her latest album All I Ever Wanted isn't really a song that feels like it is original. Actually, if you honestly get a closer listen to the song, it actually sounds a bit too similar in its melody like Beyonce's recent song Halo. I really am not that fully impressed with Kelly's latest, not only that, but it also is a bit dissapointing. It doesn't bring out the heart on other recent songs, like Whitney Houston's elequent I Look To You. I really definitely think Kelly Clarkson should try and find better songs to make her own, than feeling like she is copying someone else.Song: D 1/2-\n", "val": 6.770339678041637e-05}

{"text": "Already Gone is one of Kelly Clarkson's most haunting songs ever.A little precursor.Kelly had originally wrote the song ALREADY GONE.  Producer Ryan Tedder, from One Republic, helped polish the song with Clarkson and then produced it.  Unfortunately for Kelly, after Ryan had finished work with Kelly on her album (with about 6 or so songs) he went to work with Beyonce on her new album.  Ryan used a similar, BUT NOT THE SAME, backing track for Beyonce's HALO. (Essentially a similar backing drum beat)Be it Beyonce's label or management, knowingly or unknowingly, put a rush to release HALO before Clarkson's camp had time to release ALREADY GONE.Since Halo was released to radio first, most listeners draw comparisions from Halo to Already Gone.  Kelly has been ridiculed for the similarities when it wasn't even her fault the situation occured.  She worked with Tedder first, and her song Already Gone was written and produced first.  After the fact, she heard Halo and called Ryan to voice her displeasure.Kelly fought with her label to not release Already Gone as her third single. Not for the fact she doesn't like the song, but out of respect for Beyonce.  Since Halo was still on the charts, Kelly felt it would be disrepectful to Beyonce to release the song. Her label defied her wishes and released the song anyway.  Kelly has since changed the production of the song during her live performances on television and on her ALL I EVER WANTED TOUR to discourage any similarities from her song ALREADY GONE to HALO.NOW.Already Gone ranks right up there with Because of You as one of her songs that you can feel the depth, the soul, the lyrics, and the emotion.  Kelly can sing anything and make it sound good, but she strikes it home with the haunting and gut wrenching ballads she so skillfully and masterfully performs.THE VIDEO.Joseph Kahn was a little perturbed about the video to ALREADY GONE.  IF you will notice the song is actually well over 4 minutes long on the album.  The video is only about 3:30.  The video was shot to incorporate the entire song, but RCA feeling the video was too dark, edited a large majority.  The video that was left is centered around Clarkson with subtle hints that she is a ghost.  What the viewers are missing is some sort of death/suicide scene which RCA felt would revert Kelly back into the My December ages.  Viewers and fans alike feel differently as a final conclusion would have made the music video complete.Kelly is a true gem who is completely underrated.  This girl can sing anything.Anyone that denies her of her talent needs to see her live.I challenge anyone with a negative image of this girl go to a concert and come out feeling the same.Its okay if you don't like her music, but don't hate the girl.  She has threw away the typical Hollywood celebrity image and made her own.As Kelly has said ALL SHE EVER WANTED is to make good music.\n", "val": 0.0029932509642094374}

{"text": "Theme song to \"You Only Live Twice\", sung by Nancy Sinatra.  Ms. Sinatra does not pretend to have the vocal talents of her celebrated father (few, if any, do) but her rendition of \"You Only Live Twice\" is quite nice.  Backed up by a string orchestra her performance is quite capable.  In 1967 Ms. Sinatra was well at the top of her game and it was that fact as much as her talent and lineage (I suspect) that enabled her to garner the \"James Bond\" theme gig.Having been given the chance Ms. Sinatra grabs it with both hands and does a very nice rendition indeed.The only caveat - listen to this performance with decent equipment.  On a cheap set of earphones or laptop speakers the orchestration comes off \"tinny\" and Ms. Sinatra's efforts are not realized to their full potential.Regards,Jim\n", "val": 9.968976519303396e-05}

{"text": "This CD of the Broadway revival of \"Hair\" is crisply recorded, energetically sung by an enthusiastic cast and smoothly supported by a first-rate band.  So why are the results so utterly abysmal?  Well, for starters, \"Hair\" has to have one of the worst, most amateurish scores ever written.  There are perhaps four or five memorable songs, but the rest is made up of scraps of things that rarely last beyond two minutes.  Vamps, chanted choruses and pastiche parodies don't add up to much.  And the lyrics are some of the clumsiest concoctions ever heard on Broadway.  \"Singing...our space songs on a spider web...sitar...life flows around you and in you...answer for Timothy Leary...deary.\"  Huh?  Lyricists James Rado and Gerome Ragni must have been enjoying acid trip #364 when they came up with that lulu.  Throw in the knee jerk mockeries of the \"Hail Mary\" and the Constitution (shorthand at the time for showing you were \"with it\") and it becomes clear that these guys aren't songwriters; they're hacks.The cast members try but the problem is, they try too hard.  The vocal mugging and gosh-darn earnest euphoria is so over-the-top they sound like they just came off the bus-and-truck tour of \"Godspell\".  Everyone has a terminal case of the cutes.  Even though they're singing about hashish, LSD, war and various sexual activities, they sound about as threatening and subversive as the Partridge Family.  Will Swenson as Berger is the chief offender.  His vocal affectations and attention-seeking swagger are relentlessly overbearing in a show-offy way.  After a while, I forgot he was supposed to be playing a hippy...I thought he was the reincarnation of Sammy Davis Jr.  Brutal.  Gavin Creel is less offensive as Claude, but his reedy, wan tenor is a slight instrument that never registers.  The only ones who come out unscathed are Sasha Allen, who does just fine with her stirring rendition of \"Aquarius\", and Cassie Levy, who brings a simple gracefulness to \"Easy to Be Hard\" and \"Good Morning Starshine\".  The energy-soaked \"Hair\" survives nearly unscathed as a hippy-dippy anthem.  Of course, it's hard to completely botch this song since it's such a euphoric upper, but Will Swenson's overkill almost succeeds in doing just that (can someone please make sure his Ritalin is replenished...SOON).Unfortunately, the few glimmers of hope are surrounded by so much pushy theatricality that listening to this CD becomes an ordeal.  Somebody forgot to inform the singers that they don't need to hit the back row of the balcony on a cast recording.  Easy to be hard?  For this bunch, it's apparently \"hard to be easy\".\n", "val": 5.022750701755285e-05}

{"text": "When I saw this Tony-award-winning Broadway revival a few months ago, I was expecting a quaint period piece with some great rock music.  I was surprised and pleased at how relevant and moving the show truly is.  Much of that is, I think, due to Diane Paulus' brilliant direction; but conceptually, the show is much stronger than I'd remembered.  MacDermot, Ragni and Rado wrote (perhaps in spite of their intentions) a musical in the true sense of the word, with a story and characters the audience really cares about.  (And let's credit original director Tom O'Horgan for helping to shape the show and pull it all together.)  Their genius was doing so in a rock music idiom that hadn't been heard in the theater before; not to mention the taboo-breaking lyrics and fiery, anti-establishment content.  One can only imagine the electricity and shock that songs like \"Sodomy\" and \"Colored Spade\" must have sent through 1960s audiences.As a record of this exciting new production, the CD is amazingly successful.  The final moments don't quite have the power they do in the theater (minus the heartbreaking stage picture), but that's quibbling.  The album's producers and musical director Nadia Digialloardo have done a fantastic job of capturing the energy and passion of their remarkable cast.  I thought Gavin Creel live was a bit too much young Republican (even with the wig), but here it's all about the voice, and the voice is outstanding, heartfelt and crystal-clear.  Everyone is fantastic, frankly, from Will Swenson's goofy, free-spirited Berger to Caissie Levy's ardent Sheila to Sasha Allen's blazing Dionne.Sitting in the theater, watching the show, I kept thinking, \"I can't wait for the album to come out.\"  Well, it's here, and it was well worth the wait.  So sit back and let the sun shine in.  But put down the mind-altering substances; you won't want to miss any of this terrific recording (which just might be a mind-altering substance in itself, actually!).\n", "val": 0.040001027286052704}

{"text": "This CD is a cast recording of the \"Hair\" revival which opened on Broadway in 2009, following a hugely successful  run at the Public Theatre's Shakespeare in the Park during the summer of 2008, which became the hottest ticket in town. For years \"Hair\" fans who wanted a recording of the show had their choice of the original cast album (which I always found somehow lacking in energy and spirit), one of the cast albums from an overseas production over the years, or the soundtrack from the under-rated 1979 Milos Forman movie (which until now was my go-to album for \"Hair\"). Now, with this cast album, \"Hair\" devotees have a album that, while it does not fully recapture the experience of seeing the show live in the theatre, (no cast album can ever truly do that) does deliver a first-class listening experience of one of the pre-eminent musicals of the past 50 years.Listening to this album one realizes that, for all its revolutionary and subversive trappings of the show, just how strong (and in some ways conventional) the score actually is. The composers used a mixture of sources --  pop, rock, psychedelic, gospel, and Broadway sound to craft a score that fully conveys the emotions and psychology of the characters while also moving what passes for the \"plot\" along, as is the case in any Broadway musical. The only difference here is that along with their hopes and fears  the characters are singing about sex, drugs, and  politics, in a manner that is both heartfelt and calculated to shock the sensibilities of middle-class squares. You know who you are, man.While some of the music and references are dated, it is remarkable how well the score holds up, overall. Yes, the songs that are most familiar to general audiences -- \"Aquarius,\" Hair,\" \"Where Do I Go?\" \"Easy To Be Hard\" and \"Good Morning Starshine\" are here, delivered, for most part, in performances that make them sound fresh and new while also make it seem like we are meeting up again with old friends. But one of the joys of this soundtrack (as with the show itself, which I had the pleasure of seeing) is coming across songs long hidden in the score that now jump out and linger with you long after the CD is over.\"Air,\" which is a brief environmental lament and features one of the best solo vocal performances of the entire album, \"Hare Krishna/Be-In,\" which begins as a playful, joyous, Eastern music-influenced number that builds in crescendo and becomes more intense and serious as the \"Tribe\" tries to get Claude to burn his draft card, \"Electric Blues,\" a tongue-in-cheek \"old fashioned melody\" that both spoofs the idea of a show-stopping number while delivering just that. The mournful \"\"Walking in Space\" Three-Five-Zero-Zero\" are haunting antiwar numbers  while songs such as \"Initials\" and  \"What a Piece of Work is Man\" are delightful exercises in lyrical word-play.The album's one weakness if the same as the show's: Claude's drug trip that consumes much of Act 2. I found this sequence draggy in the theatre and also on the CD, frankly, watching somebody else's acid trip is about as interesting as listening to somebody recall a dream they had. After a minute or so, the eyes and ears glaze over. But the show and CD quickly recover as Claude, struggling over whether to dodge the draft or obey the law,  rushes to his fate. The final numbers \"The Flesh Failures/Eyes Look Your Last/Let The Sun Shine In\" deliver a real emotional wallop. \"Let The Sun Shine\" has become known as a joyful anthem, while in fact it is a mournful elegy for an entire generation.This CD includes a booklet featuring informative essays about this revival from several of  the creative people behind it along with a number of photographs.Is \"Hair\" a relic of the 1960s? This CD makes a powerful argument that \"Hair,\" like all great pop culture artifacts, can be both of its time and timely to other generations as well. Certainly its concerns -- racism, sexism, generational conflict, the struggles of the individual against our modern, anti-human age -- are still with us. And its main story -- the struggle for young people to search for meaning and identity at a time when the wrong choices literally had life and death consequences -- heighten its impact.

{"text": "I always had a problem with the original 1968 Broadway cast recording. A lot of the singing -- including that done by the so-called professionals -- is bad. The music was rather limp. And overall, the album sounded like any other show's cast recording. It didn't sound like rock music, despite being called a rock musical. I later found out from people involved that there was a good reason: the album was rush-recorded, and cast members were pulled out of rehearsal with no notice to run in and overdub their vocals. As a result, the recording didn't have the oomph that would appear on subsequent albums recorded by the original Broadway cast, such as DisinHAIRited and Divine Hair/Mass in F, both of which do have a rock vibe.The new Broadway album, though, has a highly unusual vibe to it. First, let me just say that I saw the show in July, and it was fantastic. One thing that really drove the show: the music as performed by the band, especially with Bernard Purdie's spirited drumming. But when you listen to the cast recording, you'll find that the feel is very subdued -- the band seems to be mixed in the background, as if they didn't want to wake the baby. Really, it sounds very mellow -- the exact opposite of how the music sounds if you go to the Al Hirschfeld Theater. I'm not saying it's BAD. In fact, in a way, it's good. Let me explain.If you ever read the paperback book of Hair that came out in 1969 (it's an amalgam of the off-Broadway and Broadway scripts), the notations emphasize how important it is that the audience hear the lyrics. Well, when you listen to the new Broadway cast recording, it becomes apparent that the producers of the album want us to hear the lyrics and, therefore, the message. My wife even commented that for the first time, she could understand the lyrics to songs she could never make out before, in particular \"Walking In Space.\" Some of the more raucous songs, particularly \"Ain't Got No Grass\" and \"Electric Blues,\" sound like they may have even been slowed down to make the lyrics more intelligible -- indeed, of the dozen or so different cast recordings I've heard, this is the first one in which I could actually tell what the lyrics to \"Electric Blues\" were just by listening.So that's what's going on here: the lyrics, the message, are the emphasis more so than the music. If you haven't seen the revival on stage, you might be a bit put off by this recording and think that Hair has gone mellow -- but take it from someone who recently saw the new production: it definitely has NOT. It's just that the band is laid back in the recording (they're definitely not on stage!) to give the message of Hair a little more focus.\n", "val": 7.763846224406734e-05}
{"text": "Over 40 years after it originally debuted, \"Hair\" has finally received a proper Broadway revival.  Still relevant after all these years, the show has been blessed with a transcendant new production which has earned every major Best Revival award.  Now the revival has been recorded and preserved for posperity, and Broadway fans are certainly the biggest benefactors of that event.First off, we have to acknowledge the strenght of this score as one of the main reasons the show has survived and remained as popular as it has.  When it debuted, the show introduced a rock sound into the theatre that led to more radio hits than any musical since.  Songs like \"Aquarius\" and \"Let the Sunshine In\" have entered the American consciousness, and the other pop hits (\"Easy to Be Hard\" and \"Good Morning, Starshine\" among them) may not be as famous, but are no less wonderful from a purely songwriting standpoint.  All 30+ songs in \"Hair's\" score are very strong indeed, giving the revival great material to work with.But what truly elevates this recording above so many others is the unbriddled enthusiasm and pure vocal talent of the uniformly excellent cast.  They belt out song after song with reckless abandon, making these old songs sound new again.  While some purist may take issue with the way the songs have been \"Idolized\" (re: turned into showcases for vocal gymnastics a la a certain popular TV singing competition), one of the strengths of \"Hair\" is its ability to be molded to fit each new generation and feel current, while still embodying the spirit of the hippie era.  This is not a simple retread of the Original Cast Recording (still readily available and well worth a listen), nor does it try to be.The vocal standout of a cast filled with exceptional singers is Broadway newcomer Sasha Allen, in the much expanded role of Dionne.  Her lush, full throated belt soars into the stratosphere and is simply entralling, and it is showcased throughout this disc.  I defy anyone to listen to her thrilling rendition and riffing on \"Aquarius,\" her sass-filled version of \"White Boys,\" or her electrifying descant over \"Let the Sunshine In\" and not be impressed with the power and range of her voice.  Allen is a star, and if she wanted to, could easily become a full-fledged recording artist.  Her songs are a joy to listen to, and WILL have you hitting the repeat button.Yet as phenomenal as she is, Allen is surrounded by equally strong co-stars.  As Claude, the always fantastic Gavin Creel uses his soaring, silky-smooth tenor to terrific effect.  His contagious joy during \"I Got Life,\" his vulnerability and soul-stirring anguish on \"Where Do I Go?,\" and the manic desperation he lends to \"The Flesh Failures\" are all highlights.  As Shelia, Caissie Levy provides thrillingly sung renditions of \"I Believe in Love,\" \"Good Morning Starshine,\" and one of the score's strongest and most heartfelt songs, \"Easy to Be Hard.\"  And while Will Swenson's Berger may not be as vocally stunning as the other leads, there is an energy and passion to his performances of songs like \"Donna\" and \"Going Down\" that leaps out of the speakers and into your living room.The secondary characters and featured soloist are just as strong, with the possible exception of Darius Nichols as Hud, who tries a little too hard with the riffing without ever making it fully work.  As a group, the cast sounds fantastic, as evidenced by songs like \"Three Five Zero Zero\" and the title track.  When the entire Tribe sings, it is vocal magic, a combination of excellent vocal blending and standout sound mixing.  From end to end, this CD is stellar, and I have been listening to it repeatedly since I first got it in late May (it is now August).  Any interested party shouldn't hesitate to buy this disc; it will be one of the best purchases you've made all year.\n", "val": 0.01612279750406742}

{"text": "More than forty years later, \"Hair\" still elicits the same sort of complaints that it did when it originally opened at the Biltmore Theatre in 1968, essentially a piece of experimental theatre transferred from New York's Public Theatre. This current revival appropriately follows the same course: from an initial run at the New York Shakespeare Festival in Central Park last summer to an unveiling at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre. One thing, however, that even its critics over the years seem to agree on, is Galt MacDermot's brilliant score. In 1968, Time magazine said of the Broadway production: \"What holds Hair together is the score, which pulses with an insistent, primitive beat.\" Forty-one years later, Variety magazine says of the 2009 production: \"The score's vigorousness and variety are remarkable, threading together delicate melodies with driving, combustible ones, double-edged comic sketches with celebratory anthems, dirty funk, hippie-dippie lovefests and satirical ditties.\"This new recording successfully capture's the score's vigor, even if it doesn't quite showcase its variety. The vocals here are all (not surprisingly) excellent, and (surprisingly) impassioned. The moment you hear Sasha Allen and the tribe announce the dawning of the age of Aquarius is thrilling. (Although, I should note: Allen's performance is relatively subdued compared to Ren Woods on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/film-soundtrack/dp/B00000JYU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">film soundtrack</a>.) Gavin Creel as Claude has a pleasant voice, although it perhaps lacks the masculine grit and vivacity of James Rado's of the original Broadway cast. His singing on \"Flesh Failures\", however, is actually quite moving. Will Swenson as Berger is decidedly less abrasive than the force of nature that was Gerome Ragni (on both the original Off-Broadway and original Broadway cast recordings). The performance of \"Donna\" is good fun.This is also quite possibly the best-sung tribe on record. Nary a screech or a crack or other vocal imperfection to be heard. This is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing in the sense that the ensemble numbers come off polished and cohesive. A curse because Hair has never been about vocal prowess. In other words, this sounds more like a \"cast\" (which would be serviceable for any other musical in the Broadway canon) than a \"tribe\" (which is undeniably special to Hair).Now to anoher matter: the arrangements. The problem seems mostly to do with the new arrangements, which homogenize Hair's originally diverse musical landscape. The original production managed to make use of a plethora of instrumentation and played to the diverse vocal talents of its cast. MacDermot managed to evoke everything from 50s jukebox ballads (\"Electric Blues\"), to soul (\"Easy to Be Hard\"), to rock (\"Flesh Failures (Let the Sunshine In)\"), and even managed to convey subtle diversity within each genre. The new arrangements are polished and guitar- and horn-heavy; many also pull heavy influence from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/1979-film/dp/0792841638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">1979 film</a>, which strips the score of its more tribal beats in favor of more contemporary beat-machine percussion and funk arrangements.The title number suffers the most from this treatment: the original had a swaggering, animalistic groove to it. (Listen to James Rado's delivery of \"Give me a HEAD with HAIR!\" There was an almost sexual energy in his voice.) Both the film and this recording speed up the tempo considerably and wash out the pulsing beat, dulling the impact. Then there is a bizarrely milquetoast version of \"Easy to Be Hard.\" There is no reason why one cannot take a risk with this song. The original London cast recording has a beautiful acoustic-rock arrangement. But this new version is cheestastic. Caissie Levy as Sheila makes the most of a lost opportunity. The most genuinely beautiful touch of the recording is actually when the band cuts out completely during \"Flesh Failures\" and the cast is left singing the last few pleas of \"Let the sun shine in\" a capella, emphasizing the beautiful words.Undoubtedly, the best place to start for anyone new to \"Hair\" is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/RCA-Victor-s-deluxe-edition/dp/B0000DZ3IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">RCA Victor's deluxe edition</a>&nbsp;for the Original Broadway Cast Recording, which includes the Original 1967 Off-Broadway Cast Recording as a bonus. The sound quality is much improved from the previous CD release, and you cannot beat it for authenticity. My favorite recording is actually the much-maligned&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/original-London-cast-recording/dp/B000008131/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">original London cast recording</a>&nbsp;on Decca; the singing from much of the cast doesn't match the caliber of either the OBCR or this revival, but the recording has the right balance of heart, soul and anger. It also has probably the most cohesive performances of the title song, \"Going Down\", and \"Walking in Space\" (probably my favorite piece in the whole score), as well as a rocking version of \"Dead End\" (cut from the original Off-Broadway score en route to Broadway) and a trippy \"Aquarius.\" Hair actually lasted longer on the West End stage than it did on Broadway.All in all, this is a fine recording with a more polished sound that will probably make it more appealing to younger audiences more accustomed to airbrushed, digital recording technology. It doesn't quite match the authenticity of its early predecessors (although, what can?).\n", "val": 0.03342351317405701}
{"text": "Back in the late 60's I wore out the grooves on my Original Cast recording of \"Hair\" and still remember it fondly. The reality is that recorded back in the age of LP's, my beloved record probably included about 30% of the music actually heard in the show. This recording corrects that. There is at least 60% more music on the new CD. As to the quality? The recording is cleaner. By this I mean that whereas the old recording had a rather rough and ready quality (and rather rough and ready performers), this recording was made with tender-loving care and all the perks that modern recoding has to offer. Also a more professional sounding cast. Yes, you do loose some of the spontanaity and raw energy of the original but the vocal and instrumental parts are MUCH cleaner. If there was some vocal or instrumental line you heard back in the 60's that didn't seem quite clear to you, this recording will make it clear. In sum, it's a very worthy successor and companion piece to the original recording. I highly recommend it.\n", "val": 0.017369424924254417}

The trauma of  1968, including the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Dr Martin Luther King, the war in Vietnam, the Hippy Movement and the Chicago Democratic Convention only added to the mystic that became Hair.This time around Hair is a musical period piece,  the social statements have little meaning except to those who were around in the sixties, but the music has been reborn as a gift to a new generation.[...]\n", "val": 0.00028458834276534617}

And the tempos all seem slower and less energetic then the original.The band and instrumentals also don't seem as powerful to me. While I certainly don't expect a carbon copy of the original, I at least expect the new version to have the fire and passion of the original and it just doesn't. Maybe on stage it does. I saw the original touring company in Chicago in 1970 (I think that was the year) and it was great, and maybe on stage this one is as well.This is a good revival, but if you want the real thing, treat yourself to the recording of the original.\n", "val": 6.770578329451382e-05}

{"text": "\"Hair\" opened on Broadway amidst the turmoil dividing the country in 1968 and knocked behind-the-times Broadway on its' ear. \"Hair\" was a breath of fresh air and it saved Broadway but it nearly destroyed it.  Soon a flock of wanna-be Hairs traipsed into town and soon belly-flopped and traipsed out of town.  The reason for the belly flop?  \"Hair\" got there first.Structurally \"Hair\" was an unwashed mess, more a party than theatre, but what a party it was and the party has started anew and shaken the town again.  The wispy thin story, like a single strand of hair involves Claude a young hippie and somewhat leader of his bell-bottomed, love-beaded friends has received his draft notice and that's the story.  Will he avoid the draft or will he join the army? Will he? Won't he? Will he? Won't he?  He does and the result is tragic. The bulk of the show is ideas, social issues and attitude swirling around like a tornado gone beserk.  None of the actors playing the hippies or tribe as their called here, stand-still for a moment and even spill out into the audience, frightening the blue-haired matrons who have strolled in to check out the latest rage.Gavin Creel sings sweetly as Claude, the would be draft dodger and when you see his picture in the booklet you have to smile and say, \"Someone should feed that boy a sandwich or three\".  Will Swenson as Berger sings well but he lacks the shaggy dog manginess of Gerome Ragni-the original Berger. What other show could get away with a second act that is 90 percent an extended LSD trip. And come morning when the trip is over, Claude leaves his friends for the army. Soon Claude reappears, hair shaven dressed in army fatigues. The tribe cannot see or hear him even as he calls out to them.  The tribe knows that somethig is horribly wrong but they sing a song of hope as they leave the stage and the only one left is Claude lying at rest draped in an American flag.Anyone who may read this review will notice that up to now I  have not mentioned the score. After all this is supposed to be about the CD and not the show.To me the score is like a sandwich.  The opening \"Aquarius\" and the ending \"Let The Sunshine In\" are like two slices of bread holding together the tasty filling in-between.And don't think I have forgotten about Sasha Allen-with her powerhouse voice, she is the baker of those two slices of bread.Galt MacDermots music and the lyrics of Gerome Ragni and James Rado still shines in 2009 as it did back in 1968 and just as we were back then when we were neck deep in war-in 2009 we are still at war.  Some things never change and for better or worse-neither has \"Hair\" and at least for that we can rejoice.\n", "val": 4.4000058551318944e-05}

Really brings the audience into the show ... and feels very timely today.The rock score, by MacDermot/Rado/Ragni, is chocked full of songs covered by major artists and were HUGE radio hits in 1968 & 1969.

There are parts of the score, especially in Act II, which are not particularly strong, but terrific overall.Best Tracks include:Aquarius  (The Fifth Dimension combined with \"Let The Sunshine In\" for #1 hit)DonnaI Got LifeGoing DownHair  (The Cowsills took this to #2)Easy To Be Hard  (Three Dog Night took this to #4)Where Do I Go?Electric BluesBlack Boys - White BoysGood Morning Starshine  (Oliver took to #3)The Flesh Failures/Let The Sunshine In  (part of the Aquarius medley mentioned above)\n", "val": 0.038217127323150635}

{"text": "I bought three country artist debuts in 1986:  Dwight Yoakam's GUITARS, CADILLACS, ETC., ETC.; Steve Earle's GUITAR TOWN; and Randy Travis's STORMS OF LIFE. Without question, Travis has had the greatest chart success. His debut sold 4 million copies and spawned four Top 10 singles (\"1982,\" \"On the Other Hand,\" \"Diggin' Up Bones\" and \"No Place Like Home\"--all included here). To date, he's had dozens of Top 40 hits including 16 No. 1's.Back in 1986, Travis's traditional approach to country music was a breath of fresh air. He was one of the reasons I wasn't embarrassed to admit I like country music. I already owned 2002's 2-CD collection THE RANDY TRAVIS ANTHOLOGY and was reluctant to shell out for this 2009 update until Amazon offered a super-discounted price on it.ANTHOLOGY has 44 tracks and ULTIMATE HITS contains only 32. What this means is there is plenty of overlap, but there are additions.  Here's the eight tracks (in the order they appear on the album) that were not on ANTHOLOGY:\"Promises\" No. 17, 1989, from OLD 8x10\"Three Wooden Crosses\" No 1, 2002, from RISE AND SHINE\"Faith in You\"  (failed to chart), 2008, from AROUND THE BEND\"Love's Alive and Well\" (released as part of the Three Wooden Crosses EP)\"King of the Road\" No. 51, 1997, from FULL CIRCLE (used in the film \"Traveller\")\"Are We in Trouble Now\" No. 24, 1996, from FULL CIRCLE\"Turn It Around\" (failed to chart), 2009, from AROUND THE BEND\"You Ain't Right\" (new recording for this collection)While the 2009 recording \"You Ain't Right\" is straight ahead country with electric guitars and fiddle, Travis's only studio album since this compilation found him returning to his gospel roots.All told, this is a terrific collection. If you don't already own ANTHOLOGY, I'd give the nod to ULTIMATE HITS just because it includes some of his latter hits.  However, if you already own ANTHOLOGY--or all of his studio albums--the final track is the only new song. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n", "val": 0.011327702552080154}

It was fine, but did not manage to keep my attention the entire time.But, being someone who enjoys Karajan's conducting and knowing Callas's reputation, I got this Mp3 download (it is so cheap). And it managed to keep me on the edge of the seat the entire time. From the very first note it grips your attention. The entire opera is down in a sweeping and romantic style. Maria Callas sang with a very clear tone and to an extent sounded Japanese to me. Her character portrayal was great and her voice is so powerful that I looked into her other opera recordings after this. The other characters were very much alive as well - you know what I mean. And Karajan's conducting kept the whole structure together, flowing naturally as the music unfolds the story. I do not know Italian, and I did not have the libretto in front of me (although I knew the story well), but I could tell what each scene was portraying and what each character was feeling. At the end, tears came up. Truly, it was as if I watched the whole thing.I got more operas after this - and found that this is arguably the best renditions of one of the best operas.\n", "val": 0.01527213305234909}

{"text": "If you're looking for a decent recording of a brook or small stream, I would recommend this one for you. The sound quality is clear and well-balanced, so you can set the volume and then not have to adjust it later. There's one continuous track, 73 minutes long, with a fade-out at the end. No background music to it, which is a definite plus in my book. The file takes a while to download - it's 112.4 MB at 192 kbps, but I didn't have any problems with it.Another thing that's really nice about this recording is that there aren't any loud animal noises. If you listen really hard, you can almost hear some songbirds in the background, but you have to turn the volume way up and pay close attention. For just background listening, it sounds like pure, natural water noise.The one thing I didn't like about the recording was that it doesn't fade in at the beginning. If you have it set to loop, it fades out at the end but then starts up again abruptly at full volume, making for a somewhat jarring effect. However, since the track is over an hour long, for most listening you won't need to put it on loop.In short, this is a great recording at an unbeatable price. For only $0.99, it can't be beat. It has a realistic, calming sound without all the distracting new-age music behind it. I couldn't be happier with it - I listen to it all the time while I'm studying.\n", "val": 0.00128837488591671}

I know it's new, but I feel like that album has been playing inside of me since before I was born.

{"text": "What I didn't care for about this CD was that the Wind sounded too strong.  When it  first comes on, the wind sounds  too loud and strong.  It makes you feel like you're in the midst of a hurricane or something.  It's not a calming type of wind that you hear that can be soothing along with wind chimes.  As I fell asleep by the sound of the rain and thunder CD, I had the next  CD to play the wind and rain and the wind came on so loud and boisterous until it woke me up so suddently, I had to jump out of bed to turn it off. Unless you like the loud sounds of hurricane winds to calm and relax your nerves, I would give this CD a two star rating.\n", "val": 3.425280374358408e-05}

Years ago, while in Louisiana, I went through a hurricane and the wind was howling and harsh sounding,however, the wind sounds on this MP3 are soothing and much more gentle in my opinion than a hurricane as they sound more like a 35mph to 40mph rainstorm. I enjoy Joe Baker's sounds so much that I look to his downloads first.

{"text": "I love this cd, because, it has me reminiscing about cooler weather.  I can even imagine a howling snowstorm, since,_ on my player's settings, I don't hear the rain all that much, which is FANTASTIC, for me, because, here in Texas, during our hot weather months, I like to allow my mind to venture into a cooler, even COLDER realm, especially, just prior to bedtime.  It puts me in mind of the days when, back, as a young girl, in the freezing Mid-west, I would pull my blankets up to my chin, making certain no drafts in our old house could chill an already trembling body, trying, desperately, to get warm, as the brutal winter winds whipped through the ice-covered branches of trees, outside our windows and the ghostly, mournful winds seemed to belong to lost souls, wanting to make their presence known...  Or were they trying to get in...???  Originally, I was searching for \"Blizzard\"  cd's, when, quite luckily, I happened upon this one and once I heard a sampling of what this \"Joe Baker Wind and Rain\" cd had to offer, I wasted no time, at all and, in fact, I snapped up two (2) of them!  They are ABSOLUTELY PERFECT for me!!!  It's also great to read by, if you're absorbed in something suspenseful or, perhaps, having to do with adventure, where an individual(s) can expect to be severely challenged by the unrelenting elements... in which case this Cd can further enrich that reading experience, through the enhanced ambience it provides.  I would be remiss, were I to neglect to mention how Securely my CD's were Packaged.  There was NOT 1 single speck of dust on my four (4) CD's!!!!  They were Perfectly Packaged, with NO damage, @ all!  Other Cd's I purchased on eBay, which were music cd's, and by other artists, came with cases, bearing multiple cracks in them, rendering them useless, so, I had to find alternate cases!  But, that was NOT what I experienced, when I  bought the Joe Baker Nature CD's.  In the end, I made certain to buy two (2) \"Joe Baker (Wind and Rain)\" CD's and two (2) \"Joe Baker (Rain For Sleeping And Relaxation)\" CD's, (so I'd have Duplicate CD's of Soothing Sounds I know will bring me pleasure and relaxation, now and in the future.  In fact, I'm going to go and listen to it, again, tonight.  Sweet Dreams!\n", "val": 0.008590800687670708}

{"text": "I recently watched The Grey and realized that I like the sound of howling wind.  While looking for tracks of just wind I ran across this one and was pleasantly surprised.  I already love the sound of just rain and the added wind is a very nice touch.  On a lot of other wind tracks the wind is low and kind of hard to hear at a lower volume.  With this track, however, the wind is nice and loud with the rain as a backdrop.  The wind sounds kind of eerie, but that's what I like about the sound of wind; it brings back memories of being curled up inside during a storm.  If you like the sound of rain and don't mind the eerie sound of wind, then I definitely recommend giving this track a buy.  After all, it's only 0.99 cents so it's not that big of a loss if you don't like it.\n", "val": 0.012772641144692898}

That has been said for rapper Flo Rida, and his recent song Right Round, which took a sampling on 80's electronica acts Dead Or Alive's You Spin Me. I really wasn't at all impressed with the song from beginning to end. In fact, it felt like to me nothing more than a complete waste of time. He really was not able to deliver heart and soul on the song, but he made the song feel like a piece of junk. I really felt like I was choking on a tuna sandwich.

I was disappointed that this album didn't have any driving dance beats, like I'd heard on tracks like \"Kiss & Swallow\" and \"Nightlife\".I've been listening to this album on repeat for a few days, though, and each time, it gets ten times better. Chris's voice is at its best in this album, and the songs are more memorable than they have ever been. This album is more mature, more epic, and is produced perfectly.Corner's incorporation of 3/4 time waltzes, hauntingly pretty piano, and soaring vocals set him apart from other electro-rock, dark wave acts.For anyone into this style of music, Kingdom of Welcome Addiction should not be missed!\n", "val": 0.018522053956985474}

{"text": "Frankly, I was disappointed in the first two IAMX releases. I found them often repetitive and uncreative, especially in the context of compariing them to Corner's previous work with Sneaker Pimps. To my ears, the sounds and programming were compelling to a point, but for the most part, the songs just weren't there. This album, though, is where Chris melds the songwriting with the technique, and produces something akin to the Pimps' \"Bloodsport\" album. Amazingly, everything you hear on the album (outside of Imogen Heap's vocals on one song) was played and produced entirely by Chris Corner. Perhaps that's where I would have preferred a bit of outside assistance  - nobody is a master of ALL instruments - but still, an excellent album, minus a few repetitive moments on songs like the lead track Nature of Inviting. And if you only know Chris Corner from the Pimps massive debut album \"Becoming X\", you will find this a pretty different affair, both musically, and vocally (Corner was not singing on that album). Overall, one of the best CDs I've heard this year - a pop/alternative/New Wave amalgam that's entirely captivating from start to finish.\n", "val": 0.004654864314943552}
{"text": "The first thing I noticed about this album is that there are no real dancy tracks like Kiss & Swallow or Nightlife. This is a minor complaint however, as Chris Corner has made a beautiful mid-tempo record filled with lush ballads. Highlights include I'm Terrified, with its big bold chorus, The Tear Garden, and My Secret Friend (duet with Imogen Heap). While it would have been nice to have some faster or more agressive tracks, it is obvious that wasn't the intent for this record. Kingdom of Welcome Addiction plays out like a melancholic cabaret waltz. The album has a timeless feel.This record leaked long before its release so lets show Chris Corner that we appreciate the honesty and quality he puts into IAMX by purchasing this record. It is a fine album. I cant say its better than The Alternative because it is just a very different album. This is an album to be enjoyed when you aren't in the mood to dance like a fiend.Enjoy\n", "val": 0.010003290139138699}

{"text": "When I saw 99 Perfectly Relaxing Songs offered for $.99 as an Amazon MP3 daily album special, I thought that ... for that amount .... it was well worth taking a chance. First off ... this is a quirky collection of religious choral music pieces (certainly NOT was I would call \"songs\") and some classical instrumentals, with a few odd European sounding easy listening instrumental numbers tossed into the mix. Whoever titled this probably thought there would be a much greater commercial appeal if it was sold as \"perfectly relaxing songs\". For that reason, this gets a three star rating from me, as oppose to a 4 star. What constitutes \"Perfectly relaxing\" is, of course, a very subjective thing. That said, if you like the idea of having a collection of predominantly religious choral ensemble (usually small ensembles) recordings with a smattering of other classical and odd instrumental pieces, this is a great deal. Bottom line .... have I enjoyed this. There isn't a bad performance on here. I've listened to the entire collection a couple of times through and it's been pleasurable and I'm sure I'll keep revisiting this.

So far no problem; although the music is focused on the meditative, it maintains interest. I was especially delighted to find one of Arvo Part's works included, and JS Bach is always welcome as well.Amazon has a great deal on Eno's ambient \"Neroli\", priced the same as this set's promotional pricing, but this of course has more variety, and you can listen to it til the cows come home and still not exhaust its playlist. I couldn't tell you what the chorale or vocal pieces are singing about, I don't know enough latin to order a pizza, but the production, performance and delivery create an enveloping atmosphere of contemplation (or for some, an altered state).Classical fans should probably also do a search on Naxos, Amazon has quite a number of affordably priced compilations ranging from classical guitar to medieval vocals.

But this soundtrack on its own is a work of art. The absolute sorrow and regret in its composition, along with that slight tinge of hope and excitement laced almost imperceptibly within each track is so well done and breathtakingly seamless. It will certainly take you on a journey within yourself, just listening to the care of this composer's craft, and leave you wanting more.

Her recent collaborations for Fantasy Ride have felt more like a waste on the mind, and lagging behind chemistry. That showed with Never Ever with Young Jeezy, and here with Justin Timberlake on Love Sex Magic. The third single from Fantasy Ride feels like it is honestly a flavor of the moment, and doesn't spark for anything beyond magic. I really wasn't impressed with the song at all. I think that Ciara really as well as Justin Timberlake needs to find better songs to collaborate to. For Justin, this ranks well behind the other collaborations from a few years ago.

I almost would bet Barbra Streisand or Donna Summer could streak back to the top of the charts if either of them can book herself a duet with the former N'Sync icon.  And heck, it does have a great beat, its suggestive without being profane, and is a fun song to dance if I were still young enough. With that said. . .I am glad I grabbed it a week ago for 99 cents.  I would not touch this song--it simply isn't good enough or must have--for the inflated price of $1.29.  That also pretty much explains why CD's always debut at #1 but never stay long.  Why pay $13.99 when you should have went week 1 and paid $9.99?

Well that is strained from his recent duets with Rihanna on Rehab and Madonna on 4 Minutes. For Ciara, that strain is also felt too on their collaboration, Love Sex & Magic, the third single from Ciara's upcoming Fantasy Ride album. I really didn't feel the chemistry bewtween the 2 singers heart and soul here. Ciara has had a few weak songs, but this one just didn't feel like it was sensual enough to say that you could believe in Love, Sex & Magic.

I've been looking for it for years and years!This means the world to me.(insert musical geek-out here)\n", "val": 0.0003698812797665596}
{"text": "These mp3 downloads are all from the 1976 Shakespeare Festival-Lincoln Center version that starred Raul Julia as Macheath.  However, for some unknown reason, the 17 reviews Amazon has listed are all of the 1954 off-broadway production.  That is an EXTREMELY different version from this one.  Notwithstanding the many virtues of the 1954 version, which introduced most Americans to this operetta and which uses Mark Blitzstein's English lyrics, this version, which uses unbowdlerized English lyrics by Ralph Manheim and John Willett, is superior in every possible way, and the one to have.  In my opinion it is the best English language recording of the Threepenny Opera now or indeed ever available in the US.  Amazon has added a new song from the 1976 production that wasn't available on the original LP, which is very long out of print.  That song, \"For That's My Way,\" is a frank revelation of the lesbian practices of Polly Peachum (sung by Caroline Kava) that was apparently deemed too controversial for release in 1976.Incidentally, this recording is available on CD elsewhere.  Google for it if you need that format.  But whatever format you prefer, get this version.  It reveals the incredible filth and decadence (by 1928 standards) that was for decades censored out of every available recording, including the German language \"originals.\"  This version will help you realize just how revolutionary the work was when it appeared in Germany just before the Nazis took over.  It's not perfect by any means, but it has a tremendous (and appropriate) coarseness and vitality that most other versions lack.  I would add that this version's Pirate Jenny Song, sung by Ellen Greene, is particularly chilling, and one of the best ever recorded.\n", "val": 0.019756531342864037}

And now, more than 50 years later it still gets my attention -- what a beautiful song and what a beautiful voice Frank Ifield had.So many songs out now are heavy with sound effects and other peripherals. But \"I Remember You\" was just a guitar, a harmonica, and maybe one or two other instruments... and Frank Ifield's beautiful stand-out voice.Someone told me once that the way you can know if someone has a truly good singing voice is if they just stand in a room and sing with no accompaniment at all. And I believe that's true. If you took away the special sound effects and instruments from a lot of these acts today and had them just sing unaccompanied, they would sound TERRIBLE!

It paints a picture of some people in the south playing their music and enjoying it. These fictional musicians, the sultans, didn't need to categorize their style. Likewise, the tune itself doesn't need to be pigeon-holed into a section like I once wanted to do to it.

I've tried white noise machines, sound machines, and always have a fan on, but now I can finally turn off my fan (which is nice since its winter). I downloaded about 5 other tracks here on Amazon, including White Noise, Rain, Thunderstorm, Waterfall, and Waves, however, this is the one that permanently stays in my bedside CD player.I thought I preferred white noise, however, the white noise machine I had and the CD's I made from MP3's available here on Amazon were a tad bit jarring. The white noise volume level was either too quiet or too loud. I could never find the perfect balance. The brown noise has the sound diffusing qualities of white noise, but is much more audibly gentle, which makes all the difference.I'm a troubled sleeper who lives in busy apartment complex, and my upstairs neighbors floor squeaks and squalls when they tip toe across it. The brown noise has been a big help in getting to, and staying asleep. Additionally, I like to have it on when I'm awake as well, it is so effective at peacefully and unobtrusively diffusing background noises, that it helps to lessen the bothersome daytime sounds from cars, and neighbors.I stumbled upon this after becoming frustrated with my white noise machine and was researching other options, I was going to purchase the very expensive&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ecotones-Sound-Sleep-Machine-Model-ASM1002/dp/B002SMJQT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ecotones Sound + Sleep Machine, Model ASM1002</a>, but decided to see if I could save myself a 100 bucks with a 99 cent MP3 and a blank CD, and it has worked fabulously well.

{"text": "I sleep at home with a fan on, have a hard time without it.  When I travel, I need something portable, either a CD or an MP3 player or my laptop playing a file.I spent an hour or two poking around the web checking out various white noise, pink noise, and brown noise files.  (I have used pink noise in the past but had lost my old recording.)  I found that brown noise, which I hadn't tried before, is the most appealing to me - it best emulates the rich sound of the fan without a lot of high-pitched \"static\" sound.I tried various free files, tried piecing together some 1-minute segments with loops (but then you get a gap/pop when it repeats), and sampled bits of longer recordings.  All of them left me with some regrets.  In many cases, there was a mild \"wah-wah-wah\" modulation effect over the underlying noise.  I did find one file I liked, but it was only a minute long so had the loop gap problem.I decided to come here to Amazon and see what they had.  I found this and played the sample file and right away it was clearly a richer smoother sound than the others, as you can see by playing it yourself.  This review then, is here to let you know that the remaining 70 minutes of the recording are equally good.  I don't normally take the time to write a review, but this is solving a real problem for me, for only $0.99.  Hopefully this review can be of use to somebody else as well.The only downer about this track is when you use it in a repeating loop, it has about a 5-second fade-in period at the start, and a 5-second fade-out at the end.  Combined, this leads to a mildly disconcerting interval of dead time at the loop point, if you're awake at that point.  But it's short enough that it is just temporarily disconcerting - any change to mental state only lasts a few seconds.\n", "val": 0.0001282949378946796}

It got to the point where we were running the ceiling fan in the middle of winter just so he could go to sleep.

After listening to several different ambient clips, I settled on Brown Noise for Sleep. I can listen to this as I fall asleep without really hearing it which was a vast improvement over the whirling fan blades. My husband falls asleep within minutes of getting in bed, and because it was a download, we have it on every portable device we own.

It doesn't annoy the neighbors or keep me up at night.  However, the 2 Hour Pink Noise (with the sleeping ladies face) sold by Sound Dreamer has a little less treble and comes closer to a wave sound (without the waves)  and in my opinion is more relaxing for sleep or to mask environmental noise.  The Pink Noise by Bass Mekanik, although accurate and good for technical purposes only,  is not good to repeat for sleep as they made the mistake of having someone verbally introduce the pink noise at the beginning of the track, rather than on a separate track, so you will hear the intro being made at the beginning of the track if you are repeating the track to mask sound or break in equipment  (unlike the others).  The Brown Noise \"Sounds for Life\" has much more bass and less treble, and like the 2 Hour Pink Noise by Sound Dreamer, will also be good for sleep.

Here's what I did:First, you need a smartphone or tablet with an music app such as PowerAmp.  I created a playlist in iTunes on my desktop PC with TWO copies of this MP3.  Synced the playlist to the smartphone using iSyncr.  Set PowerAmp to crossfade songs for 10 seconds.  Plugged my speakers into the headphone jack, selected the playlist & then \"Play.\"  Adjusted the equalizer in PowerAmp to preamp about 50%, boosted the bass a bit, & brought the treble down.  Turned the phone's volume to max, and adjusted the speaker volume so it was about the same as a slamming door.  It won't cover it completely, but it does make it more of a muffled thud.I think it would be good to cover up other sounds as well, but slamming doors are my only problem at night.

My  one regret about her take on this song, is singing the ending to the  refrain: she sings \"It doesn't matter when, or why, or how/As long as  I love him now!\" twice, instead of singing \"I'm where I want to  be/His love, his wife/Until the end of my life!\" the second time.  \"How Glory Goes\" is so beautiful and inspirational, and it simply  blows me away.  And the album has very strong beginning with \"Any  Place I Hang My Hat Home.\"  She has a very nice arrangement of  \"Bill,\" and a very new take and vocal interpretation of this song  that has been recorded and re-recorded since the beginning of time.

{"text": "Sorry, Ms. Midler, I think you are amazing, but Ms. McDonald is a gift from the heavens.\"Way Back to Paradise\" was my choice for the best CD of 1998, so I eagerly anticipated this new release.  But I  approached it with some trepidation because, with such high expectations, I  feared greatly being disappointed.  Thankfully, disappointment is about the  last word I would use to describe my reaction to this CD.Many people  characterized Ms. McDonald's programming choices (of mostly new material by  largely unknown composers) on her debut CD as \"brave,\" but I  think that term more aptly describes her choices on this CD, as they bring  her into comparison with many great singers of the past.Clearly,  though, Ms. McDonald has nothing to fear.  She not only sings each song on  the new disc gorgeously, but she puts her own special mark on each one as  well.  Most impressive is her interpretation of \"The Man that Got  Away.\"  This song is so inextricably associated with Judy Garland that  one assumes that her performance is definitive.  Well, has Ms. McDonald got  news for you!  Her performance bears virtually no resemblance to the  \"classic\" one, but makes it appear that Ms. Garland had no idea  what she was singing about.  While Ms. Garland's performance is certainly  thrilling to hear, Ms. McDonald's conveys the world-weary sadness at the  heart of this song.  I've listened to this CD countless times and that  track never fails to touch my soul.Others have criticized the repertoire  on this CD as being all of a kind.  I must disagree.  Ms. McDonald's  interpretive skills are so fine that she presents an entirely different  \"character\" in each of her performances.  And don't think from  the relatively quiet \"tone\" of this CD that she can't bring down  the house with a big number.  \"When Did I Fall in Love\" gives a  glimpse of her talents in this regard.  TO see thse talents in all their  glory, watch the DVD of \"My Favorite Broadway: The Leading  Ladies\"; her performance of \"Down with Love\" is a clear  showstopper.  (And it also shows her \"going up against\" a  classic.  In her performance, Ms. McDonald pays homage to Barbra Streisand  while showing that she is not in the legendary performer's shadow.  (Ironically (in light of my earlier comment), Ms. Streisand sang that song  on The Judy Garland Show.))I eagerly await the release of future Audra  McDonald discs.\n", "val": 0.018650317564606667}

Her vocal range is astonishing,  mixing operatic qualities with popular song stylings; in a world filled  with sound-alike female recording artists; she towers above them  all.This latest CD is a wonderful blending of familiar standards and new  works by some of today's leading Broadway composers and lyricists.  Consider the title song, How Glory Goes.  Penned by Adam Guettel for his  musical Floyd Collins, it is a song with great depth and filled with  emotion and is brilliantly performed by Ms. McDonald for this CD.  I could  make note of a few other cuts from this recording but quite frankly, they  are all amazing.A number of years ago a rather famous song composer by  the name of Harold Arlen made a comment about a then young and rising  female singer, Barbra Streisand.  \"Keep listening, keep watching.  And  please remember, I told you so...\"If he were alive today, I think Mr.  Arlen would be saying the same of Audra McDonald.\n", "val": 0.019074788317084312}
{"text": "Her debut CD, \"Way Back to Paradise\", knocked my socks off. \"How Glory Goes\" has me snoozing. She can't touch Judy Garland on \"The Man that Got Away\" and Barbara Streisand sticks in my mind  on \"A Sleeping Bee\". I do like \"I Won't Mind\", a sweet  song that showcases Ms. McDonald's pure and lovely voice. But so much of  this CD alternates between screams and whispers for me. I delight in Ms.  McDonald, truly, and I know given her youth and great talent, she has  plenty more to show and tell us through the lyrics and music to come. So  I'll keep listening and waiting. I still applaud the beauty and boldnesss  of this African American songstress.\n", "val": 0.014812285080552101}

Her elegance and classic  style are reminiscent of Marian Anderson and other old hollywood/broadway  stars. Her voice reigns supreme over a new generation of classical singers.  Tears come to my eyes whenever I hear her. To the reviewer who says she is  not better than Streisand well she is atleast on Streisand's level and will  soon take over her reign. When I think of my dreams of becoming a vocalist  are diminished in a commercial teen pop market I remember true gifted  voice's like Mcdonald's!\n", "val": 0.02007482573390007}

Her first solo album was hard for  me to take.  Too many unfamiliar songs that had no melody.  But this one is  simply fabulous.  How sad Harold Arlen is not alive to hear how well she  does his songs. I never thought anyone could sing \"I Had Myself a True  Love\" as well as the lady on the 1946 cast album but Audra does.  She  seems so well suited to sing the Arlen catalog.  She does include some new  songs which is fine but she does wonders with the standards.

{"text": "\"How Glory Goes\" is the second CD from singer Audra McDonald, currently available at music stores everywhere. Ms. McDonald is a singer from the Broadway stage, a singer who, in her mid twenties, has three Tony  awards to her name. However, unlike many a Broadway singer, she has no  designs on traditional albums of showtune standards. Indeed, her first  disk, \"Back to Paradise,\" was comprised entirely of theater music  written in the 1990's, by composers not yet into their 40's. On \"How  Glory Goes\" she explores the relationship between theater music of  yesterday and today by mixing the two together. Nowhere is this technique  more effective than in her pairing of a true theater standard,  \"Somewhere\" from \"West Side Story\" with \"How Glory  Goes\" from 1996's \"Floyd Collins.\" \"Somewhere,\"  sung in a quieter and more resigned manner than the song is accustomed to,  is a song about heaven, the \"somewhere\" two lovers will find  happiness. The song almost imperceptibly segues on the disk into \"How  Glory Goes,\" about a woman, in the moments before death, asking God  what heaven will be like. It is juxtapositions like these that make the  album more than just a collection of songs.  Ms. McDonald's voice is  also responsible for making the album more than the sum of its parts; she  possesses a voice that, unlike many musical theater singers', can segue  from brassy belting tones into beautiful colatura soprano ones at a  moment's notice. The album devotes five songs to the composer Harold Arlen,  probably best known for his songs for \"The Wizard of Oz\" and, on  these classics, she displays the fullness of that range, from the soaring  notes of \"Any Place I Hang My Hat is Home\" to the smoky blues of  \"The Man that Got Away.\" She also is an acting singer, investing  lines with thought and care; the character of each song comes through. This  is most evident on \"I Won't Mind,\" a contemporary composition by  Jeff Blumenkrantz  that's a song of love from \"Aunt Lizzy\" to her  friend's young son. Both sadness and love for the boy can clearly be heard  in the childless woman's voice. The only complaint to be had is admittedly  a purely personal one; as a fan of the new theater music being performed  today, I would have liked to have heard more of it than the classics.\n", "val": 0.002349345711991191}

{"text": "If you read the review above, by the old-white-guy (I'm a young-white-guy) comissionned by Amazon.com, you will read a very negative portrayal, and for good reason: this album has to \"click\". I bought this album, and listened to it in my car, straight through, two times. I felt it was no where as impressive as Lights Out or Tha Block Is Hot. Two days later, I caught myself singing the second verse of \"Where You At\", and later, the chorus to \"Bloodline\". So I went back and listened to certain tracks again. Some did not catch my attention, but the vast majority, I suddenly realized, were some of the most ingenious pieces ever written. Specifically, the run-through of tracks 7-12 are flawless. Others scattered around, such as \"Way of Life\" obviously, and \"Youngin' Blues\", are equally strong.Let me make a bold statement, with some brief background info about me firstly: I am an audio-engineer, and make most of my living writing and recording music. My favorite genres are industrial, goth-rock, salsa, and Schubert's-early-compositions. I don't care for rap by any means, with the exception of Lil Wayne (and Cee-Lo, Profit, Turk, and a few others). I look at rap as a poor repitition of mediocre music, whilst someone who never finished high school talks over the top of it.BUT, I will make this statement, nonetheless: The verses written and performed by Lil Wayne from the song \"Where You At\" (specifically the second and MOSTLY the third), are probably the most lyrically flawless pieces of verbal art ever written, in the history of man. This I swear on my soul. How he was able to write this is beyond incredible.So even though it will take a while for it to \"click\", don't listen to the old-white-guy, and buy this album, to truely hear the best of Lil Wayne.\n", "val": 0.016355179250240326}

{"text": "How the hell is the title of this CD not a diss to former Cash Money Millionaire Juvenile? The way I see it is that with this CD, Lil Wayne is out to prove that Cash Money is hotter and stronger than ever, even with the departure of Hoy Boys Juvenile, Turk, and B.G. But after listening to this CD, I would have to disagree with Lil Weezy. This CD is definitely not even on the same level of Juvenile's 400 Degreez, becuase nothing here can even touch Juvenile's \"Ha\", \"Back That A** Up\" and \"U.P.T.\". But this CD is still good for what it is: bling bling rap that you don't have to take seriously.With tracks like \"Way Of Life\", \"500 Degreez', and \"Look At Me\", Wayne shows that same fire that made the Hot Boyz so hot. As for the lyrics, don't try to sit there analyzing them, because Wayne spits it simple and straight-foward. His lyrics are what they are, sometimes funny and witty, and sometimes stale and repetitive. His little kid voice is distinct, but his flow is not as good as he thinks (he still says he one of the most UNDERRATED rappers out). If you listened to the Big Tymers latest \"Hood Rich\", then you can expect the same on this CD.One of the things that got to me on this CD was the production. Manny Fresh does his usual pretty good job, but after listening to the CD 21 tracks straight, you can't help but notice that Manny's sound is getting a little old. Another small gripe I had was the track \"... You\", which has the be the 10000000th time a rapper has a track named like that on his CD. This track you could pretty much skip without any worries.So, if you're a fan of Cash Money, then this a must buy for you, a fun CD with party songs and flossin' anthems. But be warned, don't come in expecting an instant classic like the title suggests. As for Cash Money Records, I don't think they could possibly attain the success they had before when the Hot Boys were intact, but with signings of TQ and Mac 10, and the recent merge with Rodney Jerkins, they are still trying.\n", "val": 6.011015648255125e-05}

This work represents \"good music.\"Their playing is very good and their voices blend exceptionally well. There is an innocence about the music, perhaps a purity, that I find refreshing.If you like the bluegrass/Americana genre of music, then you should give The Lovell Sisters a good listen.

There are many wonderful individual singers out there, of course, but no existing *group* I know of matches the Lovell Sisters for beautiful two- and three-part harmony singing.For harmony singing this good in a bluegrass band I'd have to go back to the Stanley Bros (with Carter) or Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys. I know this is extremely high praise, but it's the truth, to my ears anyway.The playing is also wonderful, a big step beyond the playing of the first album (which was already pretty darn good). They play together with an elegant complexity that never sounds \"overplayed\" (that is, each note counts -- they avoid empty displays of technical virtuosity).The album shows a lot of promise in the area of songwriting, as well. The original songs are impressively good and make me excited about the songs that are still to come.This album gets better each time I listen to it.

I always thought that was an overlooked gem. It sounds a bit more raw here. It is cool to see \"Dancing In Berlin\" as well. Another minor hit that should have been bigger. I think Terri Nunn's vocals sound deeper (and maybe a little weaker) in some songs. The vocals almost sound live in some places. Which is odd, cause she sounded phenomenal in her remake of Olivia Newton-John's \"Magic\". But overall, it is so worth the purchase price!\n", "val": 0.037962958216667175}
{"text": "Being a child of the 80's, as well as a DJ throughout, music is everything to me. I became obsessed with Berlin since I first heard \"Pleasure Victim\". I had not only heard electronic music such as that but was intrigued by Terri Nunn's provocative vocals and John Crawford and David Diamond's lyrics but with the entire allure that is Berlin. I was fortunate enough to actually meet them during the \"Love Life\" tour. It was so surprising to see that their greatest hits has been remastered and re-recorded while still capturing the essence of the original recordings. Both \"Pleasure Victim\" and \"Love Life\" HAVE to be 2 of the best 80's albums ever and this album captures the best of both. Terri Nunn is both an amazing vocalist and one of the sweetest pop stars Ive ever met. This 5 foot girl lifted me off my feet when she hugged me after a performance and has been sweeping me off my feet with Berlin's music ever since. Great sound quaulity. I highly reccommend this album for all Berlin fans, Greg\n", "val": 0.051128923892974854}

{"text": "Moonalice's first release (a CD and most importantly a DVD - I'll explain why shortly) is extraordinary.  Let me share with you some of my many reasons why.Blink Of An Eye, I'm Glad You Think So, Kick It Open, Listen To Those Eyes, and (from the DVD's video) Tell Me It's Okay are each songs that have been well-developed by Moonalice during their live shows over the past two years of touring.  The album here offers incredibly well-produced versions of each.You'll get to hear four different lead vocalists throughout the recordings - and Blink Of An Eye features great vocals accompanied by a duet-like guitar melody.Unspoken Words was a great surprise for me too - it brought the Beatles back for me.The DVD has two music videos - one in the home studio, the other during warmup before a live show.  Both are excellent because they bring the viewer into the family that is Moonalice.  I'd recommend watching these before listening to their 11 songs on the soundtrack.The DVD also offers all the songs on a new audio recording technology called CODE (the actual trademark is spelled using Greek letters).  CODE offers Moonalice songs to you with the very highest fidelity soundtracks - and it is well-worth listening to CODE versions of the songs by hooking up a DVD player to your home audio system or playing on your computer's DVD player.I've been enjoying Moonalice music for the past two+ years.  I've seen them live two times already - and am attending two more shows this week while they're in town.  They are, in my view, the future of the music industry.  The band is creating a direct distribution relationship with their fans and graciously offer their works in a variety of unconventional (yet innovative) ways.  It is incredibly worthwhile to be a fan - and to follow Moonalice's developing story and works.They constantly tour - playing live shows all around the United States - and they make their shows available for download for free.  They are now Twittering their songs (live, in realtime) at most of their performances.  The audio fidelity is exceptionally good and I've never been disappointed with internet-related glitches - instead, the productions are always carefully orchestrated and of the best quality.  For a fan who loves live music - their Twitter shows are the next best thing to being there.The musicians in Moonalice are the highest caliber players in the music industry - as is the producer of this first release (you can research their respective histories offline - you will be amazed - so this is worth doing).  Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.04233117774128914}

I like it better than a lot of american songs I hear, and I like it more than Greenday. It's kinda something different since its sung by a young sounding voice.

The album is littered with great popsongs, easily as good as anything at the top of the charts in the states at the moment, if often not far better. The songs are sung in german, which I can understand a bit of, and I appreciate the parts I do understand, but for the parts I don't, I enjoy the songs just as much. The music is in a pop kind of way, beautiful, but also full of energy. I think the singing is excellent. I was on the german amazon site, reading the reviews there(obviosly a lot more than here), and most people there were slashing it. However I think these people were overly concerned that this band wasn't writing complicated, deep songs. That's not what this music is about. It's simple, a l 3-chord like poprock music, but it's very very good for what it is. It's great a popmusic album, and if you let go and enjoy what's there, this would be an excellent album to listen to.

{"text": "I bought this album in Austria months ago and haven't put it down since.  In fact, I am a German teacher currently taking a break to get my masters and I am doing my thesis on how to teach German grammar using authentic German music.  Tokio Hotel's music fits perfectly for the classroom.  They not only play their own instruments, they also help write the songs and have a great variety.I gave my brother this album for his birthday and he wrote me a thank you email saying \"this is the best rock album I have heard in years.\"  I tend to agree.If you are one who gets easily distracted by the band's looks, listen to them before you judge.  The reasons for the Anti-TH fans in Germany is because of their looks, not because of their music.  When Durch den Monsun first came out *everybody* loved them, it wasn't until afterward where the Anti-THs came out.  Most of those people are teenage guys.When Tokio Hotel first recorded the Schrei album, Bill (the singer) was only 15 and his voice hadn't changed yet.  On this album, Rette mich is with his \"new voice.\"  It's *much* better.  Their new single, der letzte Tag is the old version on this album, but the single is also really great.  I've seen them live (GREAT show, by the way), so I know that Bill sings even better now that his voice has changed, which I honestly didn't think possible.I have heard rumours that an album including the first three singles (Durch den Monsun, Schrei, and Rette mich) in English (Through the monsoon, scream, and rescue me) is to be released in the US in October, but I'm not sure of the validity of those rumours.Back to my title, listening to German music is a great way to learn German and this music is enjoyable to many \"young\" people, but also \"older\" (my parents love it, though they don't speak German).

Despite the fact that the members of the band are quite young (between 16-19 years) they do have talent. Sure the lyrics aren't incredibly deep and the music isn't too innovative. But really, the music is fun to sing along with and nice to listen to. I feel like a lot of people instantly think the music is \"Scheie\" because Tokio Hotel is called a \"teenie band\" over in Germany and because of the amount of fan girls. Don't totally disregard them just because they have a lot of obnoxious fans!The songs range from loud & rockier, like \"Schrei,\" to softer, \"Der Letzte Tag.\"  (Sorry I really don't know proper music jargon!)I understand enough German to comprehend the lyrics and of course, sing along!

She is feeling heroats as a woman and uses it for her needs. Her behaviors are simply criminal butcontinues in spite of her feelings and will need a good defense because she isnot stopping.A superb piece of music by Ms. Apple.\n", "val": 0.026384010910987854}

She isn't endowed with a naturally beautiful voice (it's rather flat) but she uses everything that the art of singing has to offer to make up for it... and she sure does!The people backing her up are very good and the mixing of the song (at least on the recording I have) is a little rough... you can tell the producer is changing things (in one case to keep from going into compression and consequental distortion)... shouldn't be obvious.You don't have to be a psychologist to understand the life turbulence that the writer/composer is going through...

{"text": "The Quick & Dirty:Soulive returns with a gritty, soulful, funky musical statement that's sure to please.The Lowdown:After the experimentation that was \"No Place Like Soul\", the legendary jazz/soul outfit Soulive strips down to the basics to produce a musical statement that's as familiar as an old 12\" and at the same time fresh as the sunrise.First of all, the mixes on \"Up Here\" are extraordinary, taking the lo-fi feel of earlier work (\"Get Down\") and adding the slightest gloss to it to keep things interesting. The panning of similar elements vary from track to track, so things feel less predictable and more like each track is its own little universe. The vocal mixes are excellent, too, with Nigel Hall's work feeling like it is work that was recorded contemporaneously with Sam Cooke and James Brown. As a result, \"Up Here\" crackles with urgent intensity and unbridled creative energy.The composition and instrumentation is exactly what we would expect from such a technically sound outfit: sharp, expressive, subtle and intelligent. No one overplays, and even the solos (as outstanding as they are) are kept to a minimum bar count to let the rest of the music breathe and groove. The core ingredients of Soulive (Alan on drums; Neal on bass keys and organ, clavinet and upright piano; Kraz on guitars) do what they do best: interplay, support and compliment. The extraneous elements (the Shady Horns and the afoementioned Hall on vocals) add that little extra garnish to put the project over the top. Just a really pleasing listen all around.A few outstanding tracks are the hip-hop soul of \"The Swamp\", the 60's groove of \"Too Much\", and the slinky flow of \"PJs\".That is not to say, though, that \"Up Here\" is perfect. While \"Too Much\" is a great blend of old soul, emotive vocals and thoughtful lyrics, \"Tonight\" shows how easily the same approach can fall flat if not executed well. With its forced vocals (someone should pay James Browns' estate royalties for Hall's plagiarism), trite lyrics and confusing phrasing, \"Tonight\"'s only saving grace is the groove that takes the song out.And \"Prototype\", a cover of Andre 3000's outstanding song from \"The Love Below\", is uncharacteristically mediocre. Soulive's rendition doesn't take anything off the table, but doesn't bring anything to the table, either. What made Andre 3000's version work was the simple approach: sparse hip hop drums, flowing bassline and the laissez faire, proudly imperfect approach to the vocal work (a la The Ohio Players' Sugarfoot). On Soulive's attempt, the drums drive, but are reverb-heavy, so you lose the crispness of the groove; Hall's vocals are a little weak and vibrato-heavy in the falsetto range; and towards the end the song gets a little muddy, but is rescued by Kraz' flowing solo into the fade. Yes, it's different, and I would rather not have a carbon-copy done when it comes to covering existing compositions, but I was expecting something more, something greater.The Bottom Line:Self-produced and recorded, \"Up Here\" takes a familiar formula (tight arrangements, energetic delivery, amazing solos) and seasons it just right with accentuating elements (funky horn licks, a smidge of vocals), producing a well-rounded and engaging piece of work.Welcome back fellas. We missed you.\n", "val": 0.03129216283559799}

Piazzini is a respected pianist, originally from Buenos Aires and now a professor at the Musikhochschule in Karlsruhe, Germany.The concertos and sonatas were earlier released in a single package called \"Piazzini Meets Mozart\" on the Hera label -- an unusual set that included all the concertos and sonatas on two audio-only DVDs. These recordings have now been released as MP3 downloads by the X5 group (although I note with a grumble that the concertos collections skips two of them -- Nos. 8 and 17).My initial reaction to these sonatas wasn't completely positive. I felt there was some clumsiness, especially in some of the slow movements. But on listening a few times, I realized Piazzini was playing spot on for these Classical era pieces. Like a lot of people, I have probably been so conditioned to expect the sweeping sustain and emotionalism of styles appropriate to Romantic-era works that more restrained playing appropriate to the Classical era seemed strange and foreign at first. But now I'm a believer.Mozart's piano sonatas are a mixed bag. Some of them aren't very complex and don't rank among Mozart's great works. The earliest ones can rightfully be called immature for Mozart, even though he was \"already\" 18 by the time he wrote them down. No. 16 is called the \"Sonata Facile\" for its simplicity, and a few others were written for students or on commission from nobility who were by no means virtuoso players (like Nos. 6 and 18, for example).But there are also some pretty great works. No. 8, written around the time when Mozart's mother died, is a moody masterpiece, and No. 11 includes one of his biggest piano hits, the \"Rondo Alla Turca\".This collection is a winner and a real bargain. Give Piazzini's playing some time and I'm sure it will grow on you, too -- even if like me, you find it hard at first to overcome your Romantic conditioning.(Finally, a note that will be of little interest to most -- I made a playlist of all the slow, middle movements, and it's great for my newborn's nursery. Simple, peaceful music that promotes a calm atmosphere good for sleeping while, I can only hope, planting a seed for the love of music. Chopin's Nocturnes are also definite winners in the nursery.)\n", "val": 0.00014780167839489877}

She plays the music the way Mozart wrote it.  Her tempos are generally on the fast side with a couple of exceptions here and there.  Throughout the entire set, her musicality is of the highest order.  Most importantly, the playing never meanders.  It is sharp and passionate.You could easily pay 4 to 5 times as much for the same works on regular CDs.

I love all kinds of musical pieces so I'm not exactly a staunch fan of rap or the artist 2Pac; I think I'm more a fan of certain sounds such as voice synthesization, which this song does beautifully. I bought the MP3 for that reason. I really love listening to it in my car; it makes me feel hip & cooler than I really am. I especially love the irony of jamming to it really loud but driving the speed limit or a few degrees less to the irritation of other drivers on the road.

{"text": "Just to re-iterate what others have said (or implied):(1) Unbelievable musicianship by Gavin Harrison(2) The vocals - sorry - are not suitable for this kind of music. I have very limited knowledge of musical terms, but for this \"jazz fusion\" (?) album you really need jazzy, not \"glam-ey\", voice.(3) Gavin Harrison overpowers the rest of the musicians; it almost feels like an album-long drum solo, echoed/mirrored by some other instruments. I am OK with this; some may see this as a disadvantage.I have finally realized why The Tree sounds so much better starting in 2002: the reason must be Gavin. I was listening the other day to Lightbulb Sun ... nothing wrong with the drumming there, but it's kind of just \"playing drums for Steven\". Gavin MAKES music, not just plays it.This will also explain why Steven Wilson's recent exploits outside of The Tree framework may well be interesting and spiritual, but don't belong on the same shelf with In Absentia, Deadwing or The Incident.Steven and Gavin: do whatever side projects you like to satisfy your artistic souls, but DO PRETTY PLEASE get together again and give us another great PT album (with vinyl option, preferably)\n", "val": 0.0006627657567150891}

If you meet an interesting musician at a dull party need something to go off into the kitchen to talk about then here is the subject that will keep you and Alicia Keys busy until it is time to grab the keys and head for your place.I use Pandora to find new music but not so in the recent past.  Granted, I did find Porcupine Tree surface through my Ozric Tentacles station but somehow, found Gavin Harrison on You Tube discussing his latest Rhythmic Vision (book and CD).  I am a drummer and have been in touch with all the great fusion players starting off with Cobham.  Somewhere between Neil Peart, Vinnie Caliuta, Antonio Sanchez, Manu Katche and Virgil Donati, Gavin Harrison poked his head up and all these guys took notice.  When you watch Gavin play it is the intense connection he possesses with his axe.  To describe Gavin \"at one\" with it is a boring understatement.  It certainly helps to watch drum people do the camera work on drummers and for my DVD money, any concert video I get has the awesome views of the drummer...waiting for these two to show up on the stage with a HD DVD in the bag.These songs are way off in the distance yet for me to put any work into a review.  Hey, with the time these guys have put into this, coming out of the listening world should also give the work time to breathe and get perceived...contemplated...comprehended.  But for the sake of our current business here, let me say this:Download this music and immediately burn to disc.  Hand it out to all your music-head friends out there and wait for the discussions to roll in.  So far, the song that I cannot get enough of is Source.Get to You Tube and check out 05Ric's instrument...you will also find that 05Ric is probably a good a drummer as Gavin...absolutely heaven sent...these two......more later (looking for Drop)\n", "val": 0.00013114060857333243}
{"text": "Sorry about the preposterous title--I get a kick out of over-the-top metaphors like that.  But in all seriousness, this album is forging into the frontier of human rhythmic possibilities.  It is stunningly complex, polyrhythmic, and provides a myriad of percussive sonics ranging from big and bass-y to the most subtle of cymbal accents, and then every level of detail in between.  When I listen astutely and TRY to understand the rhythms, it is challenging, and I feel like I'm attending a class that I enjoy.  Even after repeated listens, I still feel that its full scope is \"over my head\" so to speak.  However, this is not to say that the music here is frustrating.  I find myself playing this album often, and just casually listening while working.  It works great as background music, sometimes soothing and introspective, other times uplifting and energetic.  Drummer Gavin Harrison is kind enough to pedestrianize the most esoteric of rhythm(s) with an overriding (or underlying?) musical pulse that the listener can tap his or her feet to.  The sound quality of the drums themselves are smooth, rounded, crisp, and even melodic.  I would say the same for the \"extended range bass\" guitar, in fact, and the two instruments work together in very complimentary fashion, each giving the other ample space despite the overall density of notes being played.I'm hesitant to 'classify' this album because 1) I am not an expert on jazz sub-groups and 2) I find it very unique and wouldn't want to deter potential fans with a useless label.  For instance, it is obviously 'jazz-rock fusion' in some broad sense, so yeah, if you like fusion, by all means get this.  But if you do not like 'fusion,' buy all means still get this.  See, that was pointless.For the Porcupine Tree fans who are already familiar with the drummer, this record sounds very little like Porcupine Tree, and further, Gavin's percussion is definitely more intricate on this record than his work with PT, though you get the strange feeling that he has still not exhausted his full repertoire.  The album is not without some jaw-dropping drum solos though, and I am not capable of describing them.  I just laugh like an idiot during those parts.  For any fans that discovered GH through his recent work with King Crimson, I will admit that some songs, particularly the title track, have a Crimson flavor to them--in the vein of \"Discipline.\"If I had to point out any potential flaws, I would offer the possibility that 05Ric's vibrato style crooning on every track MIGHT bother some people.  I have not yet fully made up my mind.  They are sort of 80's-ish and a bit melodramatic--especially the lyrics themselves.  Not bad, but perhaps not 100% appropriate or necessary with this type or recording.  But I will say they have grown on me, and I appreciate that in contrast to the often 'busy' sound of the music, the vocals patiently wash over the rhythms.  Additionally, the vocals are actually quite successful on the track \"Break,\" when he uses his voice as a more sustained, atmospheric presence.  Pay attention at around the 1:30 mark--this part comes out of left field and is one of the highlights of the album.I'm not a musician, but I am pretty certain that Gavin & 05Ric must have spent many, many hours on this effort, and it has paid off exponentially, in terms of how many hundreds of hours of enjoyment it will provide for fans in the future.  I also recommend their first collaboration, titled \"Drop.\"  I'd give both 4.5/5 stars, but if I must round, I'm going to round up.\n", "val": 0.008740532211959362}

This song was my escort into the dubstep genre. La Roux's Voice and Skream's dub style bass, powerful combo. The original song doesn't have nearly the powerful effect as this remix. Not saying it isn't good. The lyrics to the song are well written and executed, she can really sing! You don't get the essence of her powerful voice in the original, because of the varies instrumentation.

That said, this song is most assuredly NOT representative La Roux's sound. I know because I initially bought the full regular album and was a bit surprised by their kind of vanilla upbeat pop sound.

{"text": "I know nothing about any of these artists coming into this, including what the genre is even going to be, so I'm going to give my first impressions of what I'm \"sampling\".01. The Walkmen - Four Provinces [Instantly the Bob Dylan inspiration hits hard, the music has the kind of droning sound that I tend to enjoy and I already find myself wanting to play this one a few more times, there are quite a few hooks built into the wall of sound...so far so good!] RECOMMEND02. Frances - Cold Water [Basic riff leads into some Modest Mouse/MGMT-ish vocals leading into a sound I would liken to Sufjan Stevens' \"Chicago\" record...if you've never heard of any of these artists then essentially they sing in a higher pitch, in a fairly catchy manner, and the music sounds very surreal] DECENT03. The Rumble Strips - No Soul [A slow section at the beginning, accompanied by some trumpets, turns into a really upbeat little number] DECENT04. Kevin Ayers - Cold Shoulder [A moderately paced piece, mostly focused on the spoken vocals, with a nice little trumpet breakdown in the middle, kind of like The National without the high energy delivery] DECENT05. Dragons of Zynth - Anna Mae [The name of this band gave me high expectations, just because it is tough to live up to the amazing visuals that a dragon inspires in your mind, I must say this is definitely a \"stoned out of your mind\" kind of song with a lot of layered, droning sounds and some pleasant vocals that guide you through the experience] RECOMMEND06. Aa - Best of Seven [They already have a mark against them for their terrible band name clearly meant to get them positioned at the very front of any music section, this is one of those songs where they start with one instrument playing and just keep adding to it, towards the middle it gets a bit trippy but it is brief and isn't enough to save it] NOT SO MUCH07. Boggs - Remember The Orphans [This is that kind of Ramones-inspired sound that I've never been a huge fan of, if you're into that sort of thing then you may enjoy this, the chorusy bit is kind of fun but the rest of the song...] NOT SO MUCH08. Harlem Shakes - Strictly Game [Electronic mixed with a saxophone? Then it turns into something completely different, which is kind of disappointing because I was looking forward to them doing a cool little genre-melding thing, instead it gets to be a little generic, but is ok for what it is] DECENTFREE gets 5-Stars!\n", "val": 9.508572838967666e-05}

Gigantic Music LLC should be ashamed of itself.  Various Artists shouldn't quit their day jobs.\n", "val": 4.2181683966191486e-05}

{"text": "I just discovered a goldmine of free downloads on Amazon.  There are still free MP3s out there!Odd.  These are free so you can listen to them without financial obligation, and if you like them, you download songs you need to pay for or buy the artist's album or maybe catch them the next time they are in town playing a tiny bar around the corner....  There are reviews, too.  As if someone needs to read a review before checking out something for free...Advice to folks reading these reviews - just listen to the song(s).  If you don't like it delete it.  These are promo recordings posted by record labels that don't have the big bucks to promote songs like the major labels.  They've been doing this for years - way ahead of the curve on posting downloads to promote new recordings.  These are bands that tour in broken down vans, play to a handful of people, get paid very very little, sleep on the floor of the promoter's house, get up the next day and drive along with all their cranky, tired, smelly bandmates for many hours to the next gig.  This is how rock and roll was born.  And continues to thrive from the ground up.The irony?  I'm posting a review too.  And I haven't event listened to this sampler yet.Oh, and it's \"Incredible\".

{"text": "I love the intro track.. I think it says it all. Four provinces by the walkmen is definitely good For some odd reason it reminds me of Eric Clapton ( I did say ODD), though it close to him it is farther by a long shot. You will like this if you are into Indie, light rock or alternative music. Also good if you want something different to listen to that DOES NOT suck! Track 4,  Cold Shoulder by Kevin Ayers is reminiscent of 60's or 70's rock and 70's french rock music. I also like Track 6, Best of Seven by Aa it's catchy and hum along worthy. Last but not last I like the last track, Strictly Game by Harlem Shakes because it is a mix of house and techno pop but a lighter version , (if you understand what I mean by that). The track is mellow, feel good music, that still wants to make you move your body along slightly. Overall A Great download. Oh and you can sure play this in front of the kids ( which is important to me)!Hope this helps\n", "val": 0.08774260431528091}

{"text": "This download is identical to Swami J's CD of the same name.  You'll find many other reviews of this recording in the CD section.I've found this recording to be helpful in guiding me to the simple experience of what I believe to be \"authentic\" or \"traditional\" yoga nidra.  The instructions are simple and clear, without unnecessary frills (e.g. music) or gimmicks (e.g., magical, unscientific terminology).  And I find myself trusting the seemingly authentic, greed-and-manipulation-and fraud-free nature of the speaker. This recording, like much of the material on SwamiJ's website, seems just right to me. (And no, I don't know Swami J, nor am I affiliated with him in any way.)Prior to using this recording, I did not know that this type of consciousness was called yoga nidra or \"conscious deep sleep,\" nor did I consciously experience yoga nidra frequently.  I thought of this experience, and the practices leading to yoga nidra, as \"falling awake,\" somewhat consistent with John Kabat Zinn's terminology (MBSR \"body scans\").  And it also seems akin to the trance one might experience under hypnosis, but it is certainly different.I find that as I go through the preliminary practices, it is sometimes easy to drift into dreaming and unconscious sleep.  This is not a criticism of the recording.  I'm saying this because this experience of drifting and dreaming makes me less skeptical than I might otherwise be about the claim that the practice is actually taking practitioners from Waking to Deep Sleep by going, consciously, through the Dreaming).In my experience, especially using this recording, yoga nidra is \"formless\" in the sense that the perception of the body and external space dissolves and is not present in the mind's (or whatever's) eye. As I've moved toward yoga nidra, it is as if the transient mental processes associated with body and thinking cease to appear in consciousness, and cease to have any sense of location.  It is as if sustained, slow-moving, relatively unchanging aspects of consciousness remain. And in this type of consciousness (or perhaps at the \"edge\" of this type of consciousness, I find that patterns of thought and desire enter consciousness slowly, one at a time, minus the sort of strength that they might have during waking consciousness.This is a long way of saying that I've found this recording very helpful so far, and I plan to use it extensively in the future.\n", "val": 0.0001406396768288687}

I also think that the very no-nonsense, but not monotone, approach of the narrator is soothing because when yoga exercises get really \"flowery\" in their language, I get distracted from what I'm trying to do.  So, overall, this is the one I keep going back to, even after trying at least a half-dozen.  Beware of your local stores, though.

His playing is flawless and you can tell that he's having a great time doing it. While I only knew of him as a singer, and one of my all time favorites, it didn't take long for me to find out what an accomplished artist he was.  What can I say about Nelson Riddle's arrangements that better writers than I have already said? I knew this would be a good album before I bought it and was not surprised by the sheer quality of all this great music. My favoritetrack is \"I Get a Kick Out of You\" which highlights Riddle's contribution and his chart here for Cole swings a lot harder---and better---than the one he wrote for Sinatra a year earlier. But there is basically not a bad track here. A suggestion: one should listen to this album and another great Riddle collaboration with a pianist: the album \"Oscar Peterson and Nelson Riddle\" makes a great companion piece to this one. Peterson, one of the greatest jazz pianists, even remarked how great a pianist Nat Cole was. Amazon has both of these albums and they're both great. But this one really hits it out of the park!

Nat King Cole is a underrated pianist, and this album testifies how talented this man was.  He is a wonderful player, because he tickles the ivory the same way he sings.  His fingers are as suave as his demeanor, and each note he plays is perfectly calculated in the cool pocket.

{"text": "I'd give this 10 stars if I could. Secret Society is the big band of Gil Evans' dreams. The orchestration is creative and organic. The soloists emerge from the harmonic density as if crossing dimensions. The pulse is scrupulously maintained and emanates from deep within the ensemble. This is big band music that is symphonic in reach while firmly rooted in the jazz tradition. It is challenging to the ears but always accessible to those who listen. And listening closely delivers sonic rewards in quantity. Every selection is a finely polished gem. I give credit to Argue for including some of the best female musicians around. Ingrid Jensen on trumpet is impressive and Erica vonKleist performs one of the finest, most intuitive solos I've heard in years on Obsidian Flow, a fluttering, sensuous dance above a churning ensemble rich in color and energy. In short, Infernal Machines establishes a new standard for large jazz ensembles. Get this disc and listen to it with the best headphones you can find!\n", "val": 0.054958973079919815}

With this disk, there is no need.  I know for a fact that it will be in high rotation on my \"most listened to\" stack for many years to come.  There is not a single moment of this album that does not floor me.  I have heard plenty of big band, even new stuff like Herbert, Kenny Wheeler and Carla Bley.  This pushes it to a whole new level.  By adding influences from outside of jazz Darcy James Argue has created something entirely new.  The only thing I have heard remotely like it is Evan Flory Barnes' large ensemble and the Seattle New Brass Ensemble (both heard live).  I hope this is the beginning in a new wave of big band music.  Ten stars.\n", "val": 0.009724746458232403}
{"text": "Overview:Darcy James Argue has made one of the most impressive debuts in recent jazz history.  The \"secret society\" is a jazz big band consisting of 18 members (Erica vonKleist, Sam Sadigursky, Rob Wilkerson, Mark Small, Josh Sinton, Seneca Black, Laurie Frink, Tom Goehring, Nadje Noordhuis, Ingrid Jensen, Mike Fahie, James Hirschfeld, Ryan Keberle, Jennifer Wharton, Sabastian Noelle, Mike Holober, Matt Clohesy, and Jon Wikan).  While \"Infernal Machines\" is first and foremost a jazz album, Argue incorporates elements of rock and electronica to give the CD a ultra modern sound.  At times it almost sounds like Pink Floyd.  Infernal Machines is perhaps the best integration with electric guitar and a jazz orchestra that I've ever heard.  Here Argue is not trying to fit the electric guitar into the jazz orchestra he crafted songs that make the jazz orchestra embellish what can be done with the electric guitar.  The use of drums and guitar feedback is simply astonishing.  Each song on the CD is five-star and is filled with lots of clever parts.  Each song is unique and endearing in its own way, yet the album flows together beautifully as a whole.Song Highlights:Phobos:  This song is named after the doomed moon of Mars, Phobos.  The echoing drums that open this song and the album do a great job of setting the mood.  Next, a sad melody of interwoven horns is combined with some subtle guitar feedback.  After that the mood swells and a single note guitar line with slight distortion sets in. Around the 9 minute mark the song sounds like it is winding down, and then the electric guitar rips in again.  What a start to the CD.Redeye: Redeye showcases guitarist Sebastian Noelle.  Noelle combines feedback, sound effects, and noodling guitar lines to create a dreamy, fuzzy headed, sonic exploration.  While the liner notes indicate the song is about how you feel when you are over tired, it could just easily be a soundscape of the red eye of Jupiter.  This tune is really out there.Transit:  This song features the trumpet of Ingrid Jensen.  While Jensen's playing is remarkable what is really amazing about this tune is the driving pulse of this tune.  The combination of the constantly pulsing and pushing drums and killer guitar/horn rhythm line make the song a hybrid jazz and rock tune.  The tune reminds me a bit of Black Sabbath's instrumental piece,  \"the Straightener\" from vol. 4.Jacobin Club:  This song has a mysterious, noirish, early 20th century mood to it.  The main melody features intertwining airy horn lines, with a descending bass line.  This is one of the more traditional arrangements on the CD.This CD gets my highest recommendation.  I can't wait to see what comes next from Darcy James Argue.\n", "val": 0.029754560440778732}
{"text": "Darcy James Argue takes big band music in new directions with \"Infernal Machines\".  The opening \"Phobos\" has a rock-based rhythm and, along with the next three songs, is very modern-sounding.  The writing is such that I don't particular notice the solos -- everything is organic.  The ensemble playing is also very tight.  Each song thus depends on the writing.  After a very good start, the second half is unfortunately not as good, though I still enjoy \"Habeas Corpus\" and \"Obsidian Flow\".  This disc is pretty good, and Darcy James Argue certainly makes us see he's a talent with more good stuff to come.\n", "val": 0.005106876604259014}

But for a 34-year-old composer, this is heady stuff.  Think Frank Zappa without the silliness, Danny Elfman without the hyperactivity, Gil Evans updated for the new millennium.Jazz needs this kick in the rear. It's not mothballed history, it's not superficial smooth Jazz, it's not hard-to-listen-to avant garde.Four stars on a project this ambitious is, for me, a vote of confidence in what's to come.  I've seen the band live, and they are already better than the CD, they are evolving that fast.  In particular, I love the sax solo by Erica von Kleist on Obsidian Flow.

Yes, one big thing is missing and it's Leroi's contagious sax.

{"text": "I bought this show back in 2006 off of Dead. Net in FLAC format and I still believe that this can be bought at Nugs. Net in that format. As for the show itself it's pretty good although I think I still prefer all the other '77 releases over this one. The first set is quite good starting with The Music Never Stopped and including songs like Bertha, It's All Over Now, Deal, Peggy-O and Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo. The second set features good versions of Scarlet Begonias->Fire On The Mountain, Firend Of The Devil and a jam of Saint Stephen->Not Fade Away->Stella Blue->Saint Stephen->One More Saturday Night. There's even bonus filler here from the night before at the same venue, Scarlet Begonias->Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad. This is a good show but with all the other '77's shows, this one, for me anyway, pales somewhat in comparison as the show never seems to rise above good. There's not really much here that I would call bad but nothing is really a standout either.\n", "val": 0.0012016277760267258}

{"text": "1977 is one of my favorite years for the Dead, and with the recent purchase of \"Winterland June 1977: The Complete Recordings\" I asked myself, what of the '77 commercial material is best in terms of sound quality? I already know which shows I enjoy based on performance, setlist and energy, but I really wanted to know which shows have the best sound and balance (instruments and vocals).The only way I could trick myself into not being biased is make up some mixed CDs of random songs in shuffled order from all the shows, then listen to them independently and give each song its own rating. This is of course subjective as any other review you're going to find, and since my focus was primarily sound quality it is directly related to the quality of my home stereo (which is pretty decent). Just to keep things fair I also threw in one of my favorite bootlegs and an import CD.Below you will find the results of my little test, ranked from best sound quality (#1) to worst (#15):01) 06/08/77 - \"Winterland June 1977: The Complete Recordings\": Winterland Arena, San Francisco, CA02) 06/07/77 - \"Winterland June 1977: The Complete Recordings\": Winterland Arena, San Francisco, CA03) 05/12/77 - \"Winterland June 1977: Bonus Cuts\": Auditorium Theatre, Chicago, IL04) 06/09/77 - \"Winterland June 1977: The Complete Recordings\": Winterland Arena, San Francisco, CA05) 04/30/77 - \"Grateful Dead Download Series, Vol. 1\": Palladium, New York City, NY06) 11/05/77 - Dick's Picks, Vol. 34: Community War Memorial, Rochester, NY07) 05/22/77 - Dick's Picks, Vol. 3: Sportatorium, Pembroke Pines, FL08) 05/28/77 - \"To Terrapin: Hartford '77\": Hartford Civic Center, Hartford, CT09) 05/07/77 - SBD Bootleg: Boston Garden, Boston, MA10) 05/19/77 - Dick's Picks, Vol. 29: Fox Theatre, Atlanta, GA11) 10/29/77 - \"Play Dead\" Import CD: Evans Field House, DeKalb, IL12) 05/21/77 - Dick's Picks, Vol. 29: Lakeland Civic Center Arena, Lakeland, FL13) 10/11-16/77 - Road Trips Vol. 1 No. 2: Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana14) 09/03/77 - Dick's Picks, Vol. 15: Raceway Park, Englishtown, NJ15) 12/29/77 - Dick's Picks, Vol. 10: Winterland Arena, San Francisco, CANote: Several of the items listed here are only available on [...] or iTunes.\n", "val": 0.0001251138892257586}

The sound quality is as good as any of the 2 track SBD recrodings.  This show took place 2 months after the Europe 72 tour ended and 1 month before the Old Renaissance Faire Grounds performance in Veneta, OR.  ...need I say more?It's probably safe to assume all these Download Series are in 256kbps.  I'll probably grab them all eventually.  It's nice to not have to listen to bootlegs for a while.  There is nothing worse than listening to a good SBD and all of the sudden there is a splice in the middle of a song that has been patched with some terrible audience recording.  Even worse than that I hate to listen to a bad sbd/audience matrix.

Watching Moses Brings Plenty playing the traditional drums, long hair flying like red flames, is itself worth the price of admission. Nicole LaRoche, the band's flutist, brings a bright, lilting tilt to her playing and provides the connecting threat for most of the pieces.

{"text": "The overused word \"classic\" scarcely serves to describe this near-perfect melody from 70's icons Simon&Garfunkel.  Of all their works together (and separately), Bridge over Troubled Water is the most likely to remain an eternal reminder of the time and genre in which it was written.  But far more than that, it is one of the very best, well-constructed pieces that demonstrates the loving commitment of one individual to the welfare of another. The romantic overtones of the song only serve to enhance the beauty and strength of the emotive power that will move one person to sacrifice everything for the good of another. Few songs have ever been written that convey this sentiment as effectively as this 1970 piece that epitomizes both passionate and selfless love.\n", "val": 0.04343116283416748}

I have been a big fan of the Stoogessince I was about 16 so I am accustomed to the usual sounds. But before you think- \"Oh nah maybe I shouldnt order this one. Its remastered outtakes or somethin.\"- think again. How  often do you SEE recent releases by these kinds of bands and especially original Stooges material? If you can get it at a cheaper deal- go for it.If you appreciate any mysterious cool previously unheard tunes and if you're not picky about the remastering and the whole touch-up schtick - buy it.

A lot of these lost era compilations are made up of the same material repackaged over and over. The quality varies on these collections from alright to horrible. Start with the collections Original Punks or Penetration. They have the best sound quality cuts from the era but this collection offers a few nice tracks that the other two don't. More Power has the best (sound quality wise) versions of \"She Creatures of the Hollywood Hills,\" \"Born in a Tariler,\" \"I'm a Man,\" and \"Till the End of the Night,\" that I have ever heard, and I have listened to many of these lost Stooges compilations. The versions of \"Give Me Some Skin,\" \"I Got a Right,\" \"Tight Pants,\" and many others are not bad quality wise but you will find better versions on Original Punks or Penetration.

The piano is great in this version but whoever was in charge of mixing completely messed up the guys great vocals with terrible reverb to the point where it is like singing in a sewer pipe.

{"text": "I am a big fan of Andy James and have several of his Lick Library videos as well as his previous CD \"In The Wake Of Chaos\" and this new CD is as good as that or even better in some respects. The playing is still as brilliant and inventive, but he uses a wider variety of tones and effects on this effort. One thing I especially like is when he brings it down and does a ballad type song he doesn't blaze away with a million notes a minute like some very technical players would do. Instead he builds a really strong melody and lets that do the talking. My only complaint is that the lead guitar seems kind of buried in the mix and a little muddy on several tracks, but that might be the MP3 files I downloaded from Amazon and the way they were ripped. Overall this is a fantastic effort and I still can't believe Andy James is not more famous. Too bad he is too young to have been part of the 80s guitar hero wave that produced Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Paul Gilbert and the rest. He easily stands up to any of them in talent.\n", "val": 0.0210342388600111}

They wish they could change things, but doubt they or anyone can. That's punk rock. It doesn't matter how much money a person has, it's what's in their head and heart that matters. And what they choose to do with it. They take huge risks, and it pays off because it's genuine, something almost no other hugely popular contemporary band is. You don't write great songs if you're fake. Their ability to inspire others is strong. They get under your skin and what is true grows in you . . .

{"text": "Released over a decade ago, Young American Primitive's first and only (released) album is a superb example of timeless early 90's ambient house. The intro (a sample taken from the Alfred Hitchcock film \"The Rope\") perfectly sets the mood for the dark ambience of \"Trance Formation\". The dark groove overlaid with sudden breaks of refrained melody reminds me of FSOL's \"Papua New Guinea\". Another quirky sample sets up the albums sole single release \"Young American Primitive\" or just \"Y.A.P.\" Although very melodic (and definitely enjoyable), this track hasn't aged as well as the rest of the album. The superb calm, assured groove of \"Ritual\" follows.What follows at this point can only be described as ambient, down-tempo heaven. \"Sunrise\" is melodic, yet minimal, dark, understated, and damn near perfect. Maybe the most calming piece of music I've ever heard. The euphoric yet eerie \"Daydream\" follows, before the spatial groove of \"Over & Out\" brings us back to earth. People who've heard Sasha & John Digweed's Northern Exposure will be familiar with \"These Waves\" which features easily one of the most satisfying tribal grooves to ever be burned to CD, not to mention a gorgeous soaring melody. The dark, dubby minimalism of \"Monolith Part One\" brings the album to it's most rambunctious, and weakest song, \"Monolith Part Two\". Like \"Y.A.P.\", not un-enjoyable, but not quite of the same quality as the rest of the album. But aside from these two songs, the rest of the album is phenomenal.

{"text": "So this is the eagerly anticipated new Bjork record. Well, actually this  release is pretty weird, it is not Bjork's proper album, and everything is  not sang by her, all the tracks here are sang by her character in the  movie, Selma instead, yet she named it `Bjork: Selmasongs'. Calling this an  album, actually it is an EP. How confident! Bjork is the most important  person to this film, I know Danish director Las Von Trier is fantastic, his  contribution to the musical film can never be overlooked, but Bjork is the  pivot of this film, without her excellent performance (it's her film debut,  mind you!)  the film wouldn't have won Palme d'Or. And the soundtrack to  this film is such an enjoyable affair! Out of the seven tracks offered  here, five are essential. `I've Seen It All' is the first track on the  album that was available for downloading. Being one of the first few who  downloaded it (an Eminem-like \"heeeheee\"), I didn't like it initially. It  sounded too much like her last album, `Homogenic', not the kind of stuff  you expect from such a trendsetter. (It is her who exposed you hear the  latest jungle sound back in 1997, OK?)  Well, it is not that bad after a  few listens. It grows on you, especially the lyrics, it namechecked nearly  everything, from the Great Wall to Kings of Peru(figure out who they are!)  and it features Thom Yorke!!! The vocal from Bjork's side is some of the  best vocals that she has ever done, while for Thom, he yelped and crooned  his way through, sounding as if he is pissed, well his vocal made it feel  like a funeral song. `Cvalda' sounds like something from a musical, yet  it's not all just musical. It is much more than that, tell me now, which  musical contains such industrial beats, such erratic instrumentation? Which  musical contains a singer who sounds that versatile? Screaming her lungs  out at times, sounding like a Cinderella coming out of fairy tales at  times, some times she transforms herself to a witch and tries to cast some  spell or something.  On the other side of the coin, you have the most  beautiful and touching track here: `Scatterheart'. It reminds me of `It's  So Quiet', it is just that while the latter is a playful, willful and cute  affair, the former is sadder, bleaker and touches your heart. It is sad  indeed, very very sad!! `In The Musicals' is a direction Bjork should head  towards on her proper follow-up to the marvelous `Homogenic', it is  something Bjork has never done before, yet it sounds all Bjork, yes, the  beat sounds like a ball bouncing on the floor, the futurism lies in her  playfulness. How many people can actually do that? Stereolab? Please!!  She  was the one who made Stereolab sound like some childish adults trying to be  intelligent and different.  While `New World' is anthemic, the kind of  anthem that marks the beginning of a new era, or in Bjork's words, a new  world!! `You wonder I wonder, what happens next. A new world a new day to  see.' Everybody can relate to this track, Bjork should not be categorized  as some `alternative' musician, this is pop, full stop. Sorry, the pun is  not intended.

{"text": "This album is the soundtrack to the movie Bjork made called \"Dancer in the Dark\". The movie was styled like a musical and was extremely emotional and sad.The music on this album however is a joy! From the beginning which starts with an instrumental, \"Overture\", which is a wonderful combination of stringed instruments, wood winds, and a little brass. There really is not one bad song on this album (the rest all have vocals by the way). Only 2 positive points I'd like to make:- Bjork fuses her own unique style with strings and horns to create this broadway musical feel in the majority of the songs without ever losing the essence of Bjork's signature style.- The duet with Thom Yorke on \"I've Seen It All\" is legendary and amazing in that these 2 talented people got the chance to create a beautiful ballad.Any fan of Bjork will like this, it doesn't matter if you're into her earlier or later stuff.Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.03239312395453453}

I start to ask her out and feel an obligation to buy something, so I grab this.I knew Bjork and she was one of those artists I knew was great: I just never had time to delve. So I took this home where it stayed in a pile of thousands.Well, I just played it and it is fantastic. Selemasongs starts with a broadwayseque tune, treated with eletronics--complex eletronics that create a rhythms and counterrhyhthms. This is a thread that runs through the album.Bjork can do about anything, and there is a big range of styles on Selmasongs--but what makes her a great artist, and this is a common trate among great artists, is her ability to run her distinct approach through endless styles. In Bjork's case, she is one of the few artists who can take modern production and create many-layered peices. It is refreshing to hear a true artist truely taking advantage of digital technology and it's endless possibilitesI never did get that date. But who knows how long that would have lasted.

{"text": "For an artist like Bjork to make a soundtrack to a film in which she stars seems a little off-putting. All told, I actually saw the movie after listening to the soundtrack. I've been a Bjork fan for a while, and when this CD came out in 2000, I was shocked by how real it was, even as a soundtrack. Not all of the songs immediately made perfect sense, due to their dependence on the actual film; however, Bjork seems to always find a way to make each track uniquely hers. \"Cvalda\" and \"In the Musicals\" are musically full-bodied expressions of the musical, which for Bjork seems to always divide the real world from the one in which we always live.\"I've Seen It All\" is beautiful, in its own quiet way. This song is important, in that it embodies the duality of the film, with its many contrasts in characters and especially camera-work, which changes whenever one of the \"musical\" numbers starts.All in all, Bjork used \"Selmasongs\" as an album and a project to further her avant-garde intentions while not getting wholly lost in them.

{"text": "Selmasongs is an extended e.p. (in other words, a little bit shorter than your standard 70-minute cd) containing seven songs, all inspired by a movie in which Bjork played the starring role (Selma). The movie was called \"Dancer in the Dark\", and it was reported to be a painful and difficult experience for her, despite rave reviews and accolades. The experience of acting may have been a nightmare, but Bjork found use for it by allowing it to push her to a new level of emotional creativity. Throughout, Bjork connotes the playful, but portrays the dramatic.Bjork apparently has access to a bottomless pit of creative ideas. Her vistas appear to be boundless, using virtually everything to aid her vision - synchronized factory noises, onomatopoeia, trains, orchestras - who else could claim Catherine Deneuve and Thom Yorke as guest vocalists on the same album? Bjork is contemplative, but she remains somebody who makes lemonade out of lemons. I haven't seen the movie...yet...so it's still difficult for me to understand the lyrical significance of a song titled \"107 Steps\". While the movie will clarify this further, I'm sure, I'm interested in Selmasongs solely as a listening experience. Its atmospherics are as visual as any projected image, so you can almost see each song as presentations of an image. Purportedly, Bjork's character was blind, so it's significant that this music is so visual in its presentation. The song \"Scatterheart\" is a focal point - lush, gorgeous, expressive - along with the dreamily optimistic \"In the Musicals.\" The orchestration is remarkable throughout, too. It provides brilliant colors for the odd melodies of the album's opening and closing theme (\"Overture\", \"New World\"). Based on this soundtrack, I can't wait to see the movie.

{"text": "Bjork wasn't content in just starring in a movie she had to produce and write the music for the film, culminating in this soundtrack. Two words only are needed to sum up this soundtrack, Simply Beautiful. Bjork is such a musical genius, she is up in another league of women musicians, shared by only a select few.But what makes Bjork such a wonderful musician is how she creates the most un believeable songs,whether it is an orchestral masterpiece (as shown on this album) or a sweeping ballad with a huge choir, Bjork has done that and much more.She is in fact the most inventive musician there ever has been and ever will be. She is that good and this album proves it.The first track to start this album is \"Overture\", well named as it is the overture to the film. This song starts with a deep string section and works its way into a fully rounded orchestral masterpiece. Bjork is well known for her use of orchestras in her music and this fully orchestra track is well worth the listen, because I don't really like classical music I was really ominous about this track, this is actually my favourite classical music piece ever.\"Cvalda\" is a really weird song, it starts off with about 1 minutes worth of machine and factory sounds the finally -Clatter,crash,clack,racket,bang,thump- the first lyrics are as suggestive as the rest of the song, which is all over the place and sonically loud. Catherine Denevue makes a worthy appearance on this song and adds to the excitement and energy. On the next track Bjork ropes in another musical genius, Thom Yorke of Radiohead to create quite simply the most moving track the album along with -New World-. Now this is the song that is credited with me first getting into Bjork. One morning I was watching a music video show and I saw the video for this song and I instantly went searching for it. This song is so amazingly beautiful. Thom and Bjork work so well on this duet. \"Scatterheart\" is quite lenghty but well worth the listen and it has the most wonderful electronic programming in it. It talks about hurricanes and how -you are going to have to find out for yourself- quite a lyrical muddle but it is very well written. \"In The Musicals\" is a very good song that starts off with a basketball like sound. The irony is that -Dancer In The Dark- is classed as a musical and this song is about just that. It's strangely empowering and encouraging. \"107 Steps\" is Siobhan Fallon counting her steps and Bjork cooing every random number that comes along. Then finally at 107 (Or is it 100)steps there is an orchestral explosion and everything goes fantastic. Again she ropes in another beautiful guest to accompany her. \"New World\" is the 7th and final song on the album, although this album is short it is well worth the listen. This track is AMAZING and I didn't realise it was this wonderful for a while, a great example of how songs can come to grow on you.10/10. This album may be short but every track is fantastic.I thoroughly recommend this to anyone, of any age.\n", "val": 0.07099337130784988}

As you listen to this Soundtrack you'll hear Bjork's innocent \"I Only Did What I Had To Do\", though it is not worded that way.  This CD is based on the movie, but is different with the words.

{"text": "I remember sitting in the theater watching this movie called Dancer in the Dark.  I didn't know what to expect, but I new the journey the movie was taking me on was full of raw emotion.  Polarizing, yes, but to me, it was heartbreaking.  Yet within all this sadness lies a terrific musical.  But this is in the context of Selma's mind, when the reality is too much, she dances and sings in her own darkness.  This is her joy, this is the musical she has dreamed of.  Continuously drifting from reality to deal with the tragedies of life, her music sweeps from the big musical numbers Cvalda and In the Musicals to the gentle sweetness of I've Seen it All.  But since I saw the movie numerous times, the song that stays in my mind is New World.  I admit to being the biggest baby, but it almost brings me to tears everytime I listen to it.  Why, because of the ending?  In musicals there are usually fantasy endings, like in 42nd Street, but in the reality of the cruel world, when you have been cast as the tragic heroine, one could only imagine her demise.  The songs appear here differently than in the movie.  But that does hinder that fact that it is wonderful peice of work.\n", "val": 0.018999896943569183}

I know Bjork had a lot of difficulties artistically making this film and I think one of the reasons is explained in the simple fact that the songs are QUITE different than the film- and I'm sure the way that Bjork really wanted them to be. They're more melodic, with better singers and sound more complete. None of this seven people singing eight different parts \"ScatterHeart\" this song is done by Bjork alone here, and is FAAAAAAR better than in the movie. Also the \"I've Seen it All\" in the movie- we all give him credit for trying to sing with Bjork but that doesn't mean he could sing well. On the album the man she sings with is INCREDIBLE. His voice is smooth and rich and soft and there aren't any of the strange train dancers singing in the background making it like a Broadway Production. It's a lot more enjoyable and despite Bjork's weird sense of taste in music, she pulls everything off here beautifully.\n", "val": 0.026630830019712448}
{"text": "elmasongs is the EP/Soundtrack to the stunning Lars Van Trier movie Dancer In The Dark, starring Bjork as a poor, factory worker Czech immigrant to the American Northwest, who is slowly going blind. She has to support herself, and her son, who without an operation, will suffer the same fate that she does.Her refuge from her sad and tragic life is the fantasies in her head about being the star of American Musicals. Its her own \"Secret Life of Walter Mitty\"A set of tragic mishaps and circumstance, Selma is thrown into horrible, gutwrenching freefall with catastrophic results.Selmasongs represents the musical tale of the story, the fantasies in Selma's head and it(like all bjork works of art) runs the gamut of emotion from heartbreaking tragedy, to ecstatic joy, to majestic beauty.There's probably only one small complaint about Selmasongs..is that it clocks in at barely a half an hour. Also I think it would have been nice to include the ORIGINAL versions of the songs from the film on to soundtrack instead of the slightly altered versions presented here. Also missing is Selma's/Bjorks heartbreaking version of \"My Favorite Things\" from the Sound of Music.A musical is logical progression for Bjork. She has an eclectic musical past. From the rock of the sugarcubes, the jazz ensemble Gling-Glo, her solo electronic based work, and her orchestral string work on the Homogenic album. However Strings dominated Homogenic, Bjork is in full command of an entire orchestra including brass, woodwinds and timpani, along with stringed instruments. This makes for captivating and inventive soundscapes next to sampled found percussion and electronic beats on the soundtrack.Overture is a majestic orchestral instrumental that opens the both the film and the album. A beautiful 3 minute and 38 second mini opus with dramatic horns and timpani. Filled with highs and lows, quiet and loud, using the full dynamic range. Breathtaking.Cvalda is \"Its So Quiet\" from Post on an adrenaline rush. Post-Industrial-Showtune music? A magical, whimsical, joyful tune featuring French actress extraordinaire Cathrine Denevue. Only Bjork could pull off a genre mash like this, and its amazing. The buzzing and clanging of factory machines turn into percussion, over a technicolor 1940s Vincent Minelli showtune score.I've Seen It All is the beautiful ballad from the film, featuring Thom Yorke from Radiohead. Its everything you would think if your a fan of both artists, simply stunning. This time train tracks and train noises become the percussive base of this ballad. Trademark lyrical Bjork brilliance is still at work. \"what about china, have you seen the great wall/ all walls are great if the roof doesnt fall\"Scatterheart is a song that worked better in the film than it does here on the album. I miss the duet between Selma and her son, and would have preferred that version. Here its just Bjork singing. Though the electronic percussion and bursts of noises and clicks are vintage Homogenic, while the bassline and arrangement would sound perfect on Debut. Its a decent song, but the movie version blows the album version away.In The Musicals is another showtune on adrenaline, and once again its a great number. The song sums up the fantasy part of the movie...\"theres always there to catch me\" In Selmas head, her musicals always have a happy ending, with her as the hero, getting saved in the nick of time. Bjork dilivers a great vocal performance...its not all bombast..but she can pull back to be delicate and quiet.107 Steps really doesnt work outside of the movie. You have to know exactly whats going on in the scene to know whats going on. Like the rest of the album, I love the experimental found sound percussion and shuffling bursts of noise and industrial noises. It just feels out of context o the movie.New World Takes the Overture from the beginning and turns it into a lyrical tour de force finale. Bjorks beautiful vocals, over electronic bursts of noise beats, and a beautiful orchestral score. Just like on Homogenic, the album had its dark spots, but Bjork leaves us with a sense of optimism.Its a shame you cant give half stars, because I would give the amazing Dancer In The Dark 4.5\n", "val": 0.009800093248486519}

The beat you hear is the pattern of the wheels on the tracks, fixed up a little bit of course. This album is an astonishing thing to listen to, even though there aren't many songs.

{"text": "I think it's now safe to say that Bjork ranks alongside Kurt Cobain and Madonna as the artist whom I have most respect for in the music industry. Her ability to consistently produce groundbreaking, fresh and atmospheric music is a natural wonder to me. The way she proves people wrong by not making music in a sense, but making something completely different. An art form. Undiscovered. Until she creates it. That's why she's a genius, and that's why she will always succeed in making a fantastic record. In 1997 Bjork released \"Homogenic,\" her third solo studio album to date. After listening to this masterpiece, you begin to think Bjork can't do much else in terms of creativity, yet she proved us all wrong in 2000 when she starred in the musical masterpiece \"Dancer In The Dark.\"Not content with having a leading role in a high-production musical, she also wrote and produced the entire soundtrack, \"Selmasongs.\" The soundtrack is simply one of the best soundtracks that money can buy and ranks alongside Homogenic and Vespertine as Bjork's greatest work to date. Lush sweeping arrangements of orchestral bliss infuse the album with a wonderfully atmospheric and aesthetically-pleasing back drop of sounds, layered on top of each other. The production and composition is first-class and Bjork is, as ever, 100% original in her approach.\"Overture\" opens the album. A deep flow of subdued and slightly anticipated instruments introduces the song, and it gradually builds up to a point of almost heart-aching passion at 2:29, and the song gains momentum and flows especially into the first proper song. It's a wonderful instrumental, incredibly dramatic and sets the tone for the soundtrack. \"Cvalda\" is one of my favourite songs from the album and one of Bjork's best in my opinion. The song starts off with a very interesting beat from an industrial factory. The machines clattering away at work, creating the beat. This then builds up into a gleeful and joyous musical number as Bjork sings so sweetly, \"Clatter, crash, clack! Racket, bang, thump!\" By the second minute it's an all-out schizophrenia of musical madness. Overall it's a marvellous song that starts off with an expected sense of disappointment but winds up being a mad musical masterpiece.\"I've Seen It All\" is up next and a fantastic duet between Bjork and the genius Thom Yorke of Radiohead. The song starts off with a train on a track as its beat, before starting off slowly and in a swaying mood. The song gradually builds into a typical Bjork-esque masterpiece (Yeah, most of her songs are masterpieces!) where she sonically opens up the landscapes of the song by adding depth. It's just a pleasure to listen to such wonderful music, and the verbal-fencing style banter between the two is most humorous. \"Scatterheart\" is said to be the best song on the album by many who have reviewed this soundtrack. For me this is definitely not the case. There is much better on offer here, yet this is still a good song of somewhat lengthy proportions.\"In The Musicals\" makes hardly any sense at all, but then again, it pays homage to musicals, so it's not really meant to! Here Bjork just appears to have picked up any objects she finds and makes a beat out of them, from a basketball at the start to many other various things towards the end. A superb string section works in complete harmony with a percussion section. Superb, as usual. \"107 Steps\" starts off incredibly close to the ear with a woman whispering \"Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...\" and so on, with footsteps in time with the counting. This builds up perfectly to an awesome entrance from Bjork as she sings random numbers. The beat is incredibly catchy and the lush string section that builds up after around 45 seconds is just awe-inspiring. \"New World\" is the seventh and final song on this brief soundtrack. It starts off subdued and quiet with the sweeping orchestral beat that opened the record. A trippy electronica beat is added in the background, dancing around to Bjork's soaring vocals. She sings with such passion, such amazement and exploration to the things around her, and a general appreciation for life and love.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10All in all, I cannot recommend this soundtrack enough. I haven't actually seen Dancer In The Dark yet, but I do plan on doing so. I have, admittedly, been trying to pick this album for any possible flaws. I can, as always with masterpieces by Bjork, find none at all, except one - it's a little bit too short. At just over thirty minutes, it's a short and brief soundtrack, but it really is worth paying top money for it because you're sure to get years of musical enjoyment out of this. Selmasongs was the fourth album by Bjork that I bought (around a month ago), and I haven't looked back. Rumour has it she's got a new album out this year, and I am so buying it! But whilst I wait, I know I can revel in the madness and musical beauty that is Selmasongs. Buy it now and treasure it forever.\n", "val": 0.0727401003241539}

Bjork's voice is one of the most unique and beautiful in music today. She isn't the typical person you'd imagine doing a musical, though. This soundtrack includes most of the songs from the film, including the amazing sound collage \"Cvalda\" and \"I've Seen It All\", a beautiful and amazing duet with Thom Yorke of Radiohead (this version of the song is far superior to the one in the film. I listened to the soundtrack version long before I saw the movie, and I was dissapointed by the film version. Thom should have played Jeff in the movie). While every song on this soundtrack is just amazing, it's what's not on there that spoils this disc a bit.  First off, the closing number (we'll call it \"The Next To Last Song\") is nowhere to be seen on this disk. I know that it would be a little bit tough putting the song on the soundtrack without revealing plot points, but the lyrics are heart wrenching and amazing. On the subject of plot points, the song \"Scatterheart\" has had its lyrics seriously reworked. All the other actors' voices have been removed alltogether and some of their parts sung by Bjork. the line \"you just did what you had to do\" is replaced with \"you'll just have to find out for yourself\". This doesnt really make much sense. Also, the version of \"My Favorite Things\" that Selma sings while she is in a very dire situation (I won't say what) could have been pumped up with instruments and given a good treatment. If the songs in the movie were all included in their film version, this CD would have scored a 6, but because of these omissions, I can only give it a 4\n", "val": 0.018727732822299004}

The movie \"Dancer in the Dark\" itself produced great impression on me, as most of Fon Trier's films did in their time, especially by music and songs by Bjork. The CD \"Selmasongs\" is not a soundtrack to the movie - do not let the cover fool you. The music is the same, but the lyrics is different and performed in a different way. I know that Bjork had a lot of fights with the director over the songs, and finally she had her own way with this album. Unfortunatelly....\n", "val": 0.010452724993228912}

True, Bjork's latest, the soundtrack to Dancer In The Dark, is a musical; but you have to remember its still Bjork. On \"Cvalda\",the industrial sounds of a factory are pulled off in only a way Bjork can. Combining skittery, experimental pieces with sweeping classic musical, this doesn't feel too unfamiliar. The woman has been reinventing her styles for years. It feels like a comfortable shoe (or a swan dress!!) Some may be turned off by SelmaSongs, but if you're a real Bjork head, you'll find some of her signature music sprinkled here and there. The big standout here, of course, is \"I've Seen It All\" with Tom Yorke. The emotion is here, the goofiness is here, and of the seven songs, \"107 Steps\" is probably my least favorite. I don't like listening to someone count. Isnt that what Sesame Street is for? Anyhow, SelmaSongs is worth a spin. Casual fans:start with Debut and follow the catalog in order.

I was instantly attracted, but held off on buying any CDs because I knew I would probably need to buy ALL of her music (it just sounded so good), and I didn't have a lot of disposable income at the time.But a few months ago I ended up buying Dancer in the Dark as my first Bjork CD because it was playing in the record store, and I realized I finally had to have this woman's music.  Suffice to say that I did not waste my money.  Every song here is a gem.  Something in her music communicates with my soul on some subliminal level.  It's like when you fall in love with someone and find yourself being able to communicate without any effort at all.\"Scatterheart\" is my favorite.  Dark and mysterious, the lyrics pull you in and tell an important story.  I especially like the way the bass line seemingly ignores the melody line, but ends up complementing it when the song is viewed as a whole.In addition to this album, I also own Debut and Post.  I have listened to all three many times, and can honestly say that every single track Bjork has produced is a thing of beauty.  She is the most original and creative artist I've heard in a long time.

{"text": "I heard this album long before I saw the accompanying movie, so I imagined what a lot of the movie would be like.  Surprisingly, my imagination was quite accurate with imagining the \"musical\" scences of \"Cvalda\".  I play in a wind ensemble myself so the album reached out and grabbed me from the first note of \"Overture\".  I'm a huge Radiohead fan as well so the duet with Thom Yorke is a pleasure, any fan of both will love to hear Thom and Bjork's voices entwining around each other as they do here.  I think the weakest track is \"Scatterheart\"...it seems to lack momentum and energy and drags down the middle of the album.  (The version in the movie was far more effective).  \"In the Musicals\" is as fun as \"Cvalda\"...it gives way to the bittersweet end, and my favourite, track, \"107 Steps\".  This short piece is the most emotional, it packs a punch especially if you see the movie.  Without seeing the movie, you'd never know what it was about.  When I listen to it on my own, it always makes me feel the same overwhelming sadness I feel when I watch old war movies from the 40's, or movies about that era.  Indeed,the entire album is very \"retro\" in how it borrows from the musical style.The last track, \"New World\", will mislead you if you haven't seen the movie.  If you know it before you see the movie, prepare never to be able to listen to it the same way again.  But you'll want to.

Besides using sound and rhythm in her own highly individual way, I feel that in this album Bjork has integrated the sounds of modern-day life into constructive musical ideas more successfully than anyone I've heard to date. [Considering I've spent a tremendous amount of time playing for and attending contemporary music concerts, I mean that as a compliment, from one musician to another.] The tunes have a magical quality and though I have not seen the movie I can imagine great musical numbers could come from them. One thing I have noticed though is that, except for the movie theme, the CD sounds best on a boombox, as opposed to when I listened with better speakers. I think that's intentional, but not sure...another small annoyance is that with the other files included on the CD, I've been unable to play it while at work on my PC because once I put it in, it immediately hooked me up to the Internet!\n", "val": 0.02447575330734253}

I'm not too into musicals or anything, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the album.  Infact, I love Cvalda and In the Musicals(Easily the 2 most \"musical-like\" songs in the album).  I suppose the highlight of the CD is the duet with Thom Yorke, which is quite nice.  (Even though I thought the movie's version with the actor singing was more charming)Unfortunately, I have a few complaints with Selmasongs.  I guess the biggest complaint I have is that the CD is waaay too short, clocking in at just over 32 minutes.  Not only that, but the first track is kind of a throwaway since it's more like an intro than an actual song (It doesn't even have Bjork in it!).  Also, I don't particularly care for the 2 minutes, 107 steps song.  So minus those two songs, you're left with about 26 mintues of great music.

{"text": "Bjork's ability to at once respect and transform the conventions of musical theater goes back to her croon-and-scream rendition of \"It's Oh So Quiet,\" the big-band showstopper on her 1995 album, Post. So it makes sense that she stars in Dancer in the Dark, Lars von Trier's prizewinner at this year's Cannes Film Festival, about a Czech immigrant who in 1964 escapes the tedium of her factory job by imagining that she lives in a Hollywood movie musical. Bjork also supplies the film's soundtrack, an appropriate marriage of industrial clanging and symphonic melodrama. Bjork explored that same mix on her 1997 release, Homogenic. But here the clatter seems whimsical and friendly, like the fancy footwork of Gene Kelly. On \"In the Musicals,\" orchestral strings swirl around shuffling beats that simultaneously suggest tap dancing and assembly-line rattle. \"You were always there to catch me,\" she sings, not only describing an imaginary lover-dancer but also the bittersweet escape of music, the score of her daydreams. It is a powerful analogy, and this album, although short, represents a particularly accessible career highlight for Bjork. The clincher is the ballad \"I've Seen It All,\" a duet with Radiohead's Thom Yorke about blindness and resignation that is so West Side Story in its Technicolor soul it could make Stephen Sondheim cry. And probably you, too.\n", "val": 0.02243281900882721}
{"text": "Renowned director Lars Von Trier's stroke of genius in making his 2000 film DANCER IN THE DARK was to cast Iceland-born avant-pop siren Bjork in the central role and then enlist her aid in composing and performing a series of musical numbers for the movie. In the film, Bjork's character Selma lives an unrelentingly hard life as a single mother and factory worker who is quickly going blind. The film's songs come from Selma's inner world, where she (and the audience) find respite from all the harshness of reality.Bjork's compositions, with orchestral arrangements from Vince Mendoza, hang together on their own quite nicely. Catherine Deneuve (Bjork's co-star) and Radiohead's Thom Yorke make effective vocal cameos, but Bjork's voice and music are the central focus. As we hear the industrial sounds of the factory turn into the rhythm of a song, or follow Bjork's oddly intuitive melodic leaps through a dreamlike haze of strings, it becomes clear that her idiosyncratic writing style adapts quite well to the cinematic milieu. As usual, her uniquely entrancing singing style stands out above almost all else.\n", "val": 0.032638344913721085}

As in true Bjork fashion, all semblance of her previous recordings goes straight out the window when you first listen to this. This review is little late, I have had this since last September, but am just getting to write the review, so I am not including Vespertine in my review. It starts with a fully instrumental \"Overture.\" Then continues to use machinery as a rhythmic tool, \"Cvalda.\" Next, a duet with the bored sounding Thom Yorke in \"I've Seen it All\", bored doesn't mean bad by the way. \"In the Musicals\" is next, it reminds me of a Broadway style climax, it uses a bouncing ball as a beat, quite cool. \"Scatterheart\" a devastatingly beautiful song, and what I believe to be the strongest song on the album, it has a beautiful melody at the beginning that soon combines with a fiercely electronic element, fusing into an elaborate, beautiful whole. \"107 Steps\" is the next song, I think it is the weakest song on the album, it is average for Bjork standards, I won't say anymore. Last, \"New World\" this song only truly becomes powerful after viewing the movie, it really does depress me everytime I hear it, great song. I didn't mention Bjork's voice, just because it's always great, and there is no real need to mention the one element that is a constant.

{"text": "Confessions I have to make before I write this review are multiple: 1) I was a Bjork fan long before \"Dancer In The Dark\" was released; 2) \"Dancer In The Dark\" is one of my favourite films ever; and 3) it is hard for me not to shine Bjork's tiny shoes whenever I proceed to talk about her. That said, \"SelmaSongs\" really is something else when it comes to movie soundtracks: it is here where Bjork really 'acts' as Selma from the film, composing songs that she is never accustomed to concocting on her albums, and delivering a valuable clutch of songs so beautiful and so un-Hollywood it is impossible not to be thrown by them. An Oscar for 'Best Original Score' wouldn't have gone amiss, now would it?Album contains seven of the nine songs in the film, beginning with the atmospheric \"Overture\", all big brass and powerful drums that confirms Bjork's ability to compose for a full-blown orchestra as well as a mixing machine. This is swiftly followed by \"Cvalda\", Bjork's duet with Catherine Deneuve, beginning audaciously with rythymic 'whirrs' and 'clatters' until seguing into the silly, infectiously fun number. The Oscar-nominated \"I've Seen It All\" sees Bjork delve into a more ominous soundscape for a romantic duet with Radiohead's Thom Yorke. \"Scatterheart\" follows, full of menacing strings, jerky beats and Bjork's illuminating and versatile vocals. The favourite of the film squeaks around the corner straight after in \"In The Musicals\", all squeaks, bounces and rousing strings providing a heady mix of overwhelming pleasure. \"107 Steps\" reunites Bjork with Siobhan Fallon, the only other cast member to make it to the album, to count the steps toward Selma's fate with a song by turns sad, uplifting and, Bjork being Bjork, audacious at the same time. The finale, \"New World\", echoes the opening \"Overture\" and is purely too good for words ... okay, if this was up for the Oscar, Bob Dylan or not, Bjork would have won it.That said, \"SelmaSongs\" isn't a word-for-word rehash of the musical interludes of \"Dancer In The Dark\". The first difference is Thom Yorke's increased presence on \"I've Seen It All\", singing a few of Selma's lyrics as well as all of Peter Stormare's Jeff's. Another is \"Scatterheart\", whose opening minute is the only part that bears resemblance to the film's version, \"Smith & Wesson\", both David Morse and Cara Seymour tellingly missing and the lyrics all totally changed. Fans of the film will be disappointed with \"In The Musicals\", as it is Bjork's original concept as opposed to the musical conversation that takes place in the film between Selma and Oldrich Novy. And \"107 Steps\" carries on for another 31 steps (not a bad thing, but there you go). Reasons: Bjork has said she feels better working with musically-experienced pros as opposed to actors on her songs, and many of the songs were edited for the film, both \"Scatterheart\" and \"107 Steps'\" gorgeous codas ommitted in the final mix. Either way, what the CD has is beautiful in itself, and nothing is lost.Another thing: both \"My Favourite Things\" and \"Next To Last Song\" aren't on this compilation, despite their dramatic presence in the film. I can think of reasons for both of their being missing: 1) \"My Favourite Things\" would have meant giving the guys behind \"The Sound Of Music\" a bit more money than most; 2) \"Next To Last Song\" was the song Selma didn't hold for herself, singing it for the whole world to hear; 3) if they gave you all of the music on the CD, you might not buy the film! In any case, buy both.\n", "val": 0.007441080641001463}

{"text": "I am a new fan of Bjork's music, after I saw the brilliant film \"Dancer In The Dark\". \"Selmasongs\" was the first album of hers I bought and I went on to buy the other three. The soundtrack is basically what the title states- it is music from \"Dancer In The Dark\" with the exceptions of The Next To Last Song and Bjork's short rendition of My Favorite Things which were reasonably cut from the soundtrack release as they don't fit in well with the album's structuring. The album is more likable after seeing the film (I rarely give albums 5 stars by the way) if I listened to this before I would probably give it  3 1/2 rating. The recording opens with the Overture, a track composed by Bjork which then goes into the cartoonish-styled \"Cvalda\" in which she enters a musical fantasy where she asks her friend to dance, which is something the friend does not like doing. Next is the brilliant, moving track \"I've Seen It All\" where Selma persuades someone that she is not going completely blind and she has seen all that she needs to, this was worthy of an Oscar despite losing the award. The music samples the rhythm of the noise a train makes as Bjork gives a beautiful vocal delivery with Thom Yorke of Radiohead (Peter Stormare in the film). Next is Scatterheart in which she thinks and ponders over a certain incident she just commited, then you go into In THe Musicals and 107 Steps the first one being about Selma wondering in song why she loves musicals and the latter is really indescribable and only understandable after seeing the film \"Dancer In The Dark\". Lastly, there is \"New World\" which I believe could've passed as the film's theme song as it plays during the end credits. This is the track in which my opinion, is the best composed as Bjork's voice beautifully swifts through soft music that increases loudly and eventually end with thumping, hard beats (basically, the Bjork formula for much of her hit singles). Basically, Selmasongs would not make a bad album for first-time Bjork listeners and everyone who saw the film \"Dancer In The Dark\" and enjoyed it will love this and to those who haven't seen the film and do not know much about Bjork, this might be worth a try but you should also give a try with \"Post\" which is more mainstream than \"Selmasongs\".Rating: 5 Stars\n", "val": 0.00680811982601881}

'i've seen it all,' (her duet with yorke), is certainly a lovely song, but also has some quite frightening lyrics to it. 'i've seen the tree's, i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze,' she sings sweetly, but then yorke responds with, 'i've seen a man killed by his best friend. i've seen lives end before they were spent.' so essentially it's a tale of innocense vs. experience.to comprehend the next three songs one must see the movie, and it is near impossible to explain them without giving away vital details. so i won't. the last song on the album, 'new world,' is a suitable closer, and has perhaps the most sweet and genuine lyrics i have ever heard, against an almost drugged-out trip-hop beat.so buy this album, for god's sake. even if you are just a fan of the musicals, you will be able to associate with bjork's selma, a true martyr. this album and movie saved my life.\n", "val": 0.014746012166142464}
{"text": "This review is for people who loved Bjork in Dancer in the Dark, know very little about her musical talent, and want to know if this is the album they should buy. If you liked the music in the movie; beware that these SelmaSongs are not taken directly from the movie. Bjork sings almost all the parts (no Joel Grey, for example) and several lyrics are altered (to not give away plot points in the movie, I guess), and some songs are extended. Anyway, it's a *great* CD for people who already love Bjork's music (even though it is a short set of songs), but only a *good* CD for people who are just intrigued by Bjork and liked the music/her singing in the movie. SO, my recommendation to those of you who are not yet hardcore Bjork fans (and you want to get your money's worth while introducing your ears to Bjork's personal style) is to buy any one of these three Bjork albums: \"Debut\", \"Post\", or \"Homogenic\". Debut was her first solo album, and while it is still great after all these years, it is slightly dated. Pick this one if you prefer the melodies on top of flat-beats type of dance music. My general recommendation however, is \"Post\". It showcases Bjork's wide range of styles, contains what many people consider to be her most beautiful song (\"Hyperballad\") and has more driving beats that keep you tapping your fingers after the song is over. For the more adventurous, you might choose the light-industrial/electronica-packed \"Homogenic\". Bjork's emotions on this album are the closest to what you might expect if you have only seen Dancer in the Dark. This is her 'edgiest' album though, with a spot or two that is difficult to take... a bit of screaming that goes on too long even though it compliments the poetry of the song, and (I must warn you moms out there) the F-word is used once - but this is the only time I know of her cussing in an album. All three albums are great, and you should eventually get them all. Avoid the remix album \"Telegram\" until you have sampled the aforementioned 3 albums... then you might find it a nice treat IF you like remixes. Bjork almost always re-sings her lyrics on her remixes so that can be a real treat! Then I would recommend you buy this Dancer in the Dark \"soundtrack\" to complete your Bjork collection of major releases. Don't believe me?

I got this EP two months ago and I must confess I didn't like it: weird lyrics and sounds (factory machines, trains, counting numbers).Then I saw Dancer in the dark... and everything changed. It all made sense, I fully understod the reasons, the emotions, the meaning of everything. That's why I think that this album depends on the movie, it's not just songs FEATURED on it, these songs ARE a part of the storyline and can't be completeley appreciated if you don't know what they talk about (it would be just Bjrkesque sounds that some love and others hate.My favorite is NEW WORLD, but I'VE SEEN IT ALL and SCATTERHEART are also great.

{"text": "How moving the musics from \"Dancer in the Dark\" can be! It is one of those precious soundtracks that take you into the character blind world, and makes you not just feel it, but also see it through music. Bjork's voice is spectacular! It is so deeply, so full of emotion, though she sings and performs at the both time.  And above it all, \"Selma Songs\" proves definitively that good music can be made of ordinary sounds and how a movie can be \"seen\" by just listening to its soundtrack.\n", "val": 0.06550230830907822}
{"text": "Well, I have now seen the movie and wonder if I even wish to listen to most of this CD again.  The movie was extremely well-done and Bjork's acting was amazing -- the music fit the movie 100% so it'd get 5 stars for the MOVIE --- but on its own, for music to hear in my daily life, I still give it a rather unpopular two stars.Why would a rabid Bjork fan owning about 60 Bjork/related CDs give this CD this rating?  The Overture is typical/negligible.  Cvalda is the first song ever where Bjork's voice has EVER irritated me in parts (I am stunned at this).  The beats are five star though.  I've Seen It All is so-so... Thom Yorke sounds semi-catatonic singing with her, her singing's topnotch, but the song itself is so-so.  Scatterheart I *do* like .... Homogenic-like (corny beginning - since it's a \"musical\" I guess)  107 Steps was dull before and now knowing the meaning, I'm scared to even hear it again and remember the terrible scene.  Overall, this CD is so-so.  Bjork's other work is so much better.  Yet, I believe this would've been more challenging to create for a movie, musical-style.  The percussive arrangements on some tracks are very noteworthy.  *sigh*  Her emotionally brilliant ACTING is MUCH more noteworthy than this CD.  ...  Bjork's name is out and solid so maybe the cool thing to do is press a zillion copies of the latest soundtrack CD and rave about it ...\n", "val": 0.0029873065650463104}
{"text": "This is a very original and incredible EP.  Clocking in at a short but wonderful period of 35 minutes.  Yes, it is definitely worth your money.It's a much better CD if you are already a Bjork fan, as you already well know she can write anything with joy and comfort, from industrial to techno to ambient to pop to rock to musical, and sound great.  For those of you who don't know Bjork, well...now you know.  She's a very daring songwriter, and you have to give some of her recordings a chance to sink into you.  This soundtrack is not supplementary to the film; it can stand on its own.  Even by its own, it is filled with joy and makes you want to bounce off the walls (I got this feeling from Cvalda) or swing around and sing along (from I've Seen It All) to punching a pillow and singing along (In The Musicals) and creep about in fear in the last two tracks.  Each song is so intense and energetic that it rubs off on you...it's a jug of coffee music-wise.  I feel so great inside when I listen to this. Even before I saw the movie.When seeing the movie and not liking it, it may or may not hurt how much you like the soundtrack.  Since I liked the movie, not just because of its artistic manner and distinct filming, but because Bjork is also a tremendous actress full of passion and wonder and innocence, it added to the soundtrack a whole lot, giving much more significance and depth to Selma, her character, and the songs.  For the soundtrack, some songs were changed around a bit, replacing an actor w/ Thom Yorke for \"I've Seen It All.\"  (Thom Yorke is the singer for Radiohead.)  Overall message: If you're not willing to see a new brand of filming a musical mixed in with drab, hand-held camera and weird camera views and some kind of movie most machosits enjoy, don't see the movie and enjoy the soundtrack.  If you're willing to take the risk, go for it and enjoy the movie as much as possible.  The movie has flaws, but it's still great.Thanks for reading this. :^)\n", "val": 0.0341828428208828}

{"text": "I have often been intrigued by this multitalented Icelander since her days with the Sugarcubes. Selmasongs is a nice package for the listener who wants a change of pace from the tiring pop music that is so often geared to specific age groups or audiences.Even attempts at cultural and musical format crossovers by many have not impressed me. A country superstar who takes on an alter ego to be a rock star? Ha! Or the artists that you can't tell if they are more inclined to rap or rock-and-roll? I am not awe-inspired!I cannot offer Bjork the quality of praise of those reviews already issued by my predecessors, but I can say that Selmasongs is evident that this star wants to grow as both an artist and creative individual, even possibly at the expense of sacrificing opportunities to go multi-platinum several times over.Perhaps this release will one day go down as a Year 2000 classic counterpart to a masterpiece that was not commercially received at first but yet contained the kind of ingenuity of effectively mixing great harmonies and vocals with orchestrations and other sound effects in the nature of barking animals and oncoming trains to eventually earn praise as being arguably the greatest album in rock history. And I am referring to the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds.\n", "val": 0.019388984888792038}
{"text": "Bjork considers this album to be her best work ever. I agree. As a person who has tirelessly followed her career since her Sugarcubes days, I am stunned at how Bjrk has managed to lift her music another notch and become truly other-wordly. Its albums like this that make me wonder why I ever thought Tori Amos was a demi Goddess, or that Fiona Apple was as good as they come. 'Selmasongs' is a revelation, and also a showstopper - I doubt anything on Bjrk's new album 'Vespertine' could rival the musical genius of this CD.That said, this is meant to be a review of the CD and not a critical analysis of the artist's musical growth, so lets move on. I must emphasize that this album is best appreciated only if you've actually seen the movie. If you haven't, don't go here. And while its true that Selmasongs is NOT a soundtrack in the real sense of the term (all the songs are studio-sung and barely resemble the songs on the screen), it is also not an EP or a regular album. Once again, our Icelandic diva has managed to triumph over genre and typecasting to create something so new and revolutionary, that it takes your breath away.1. Overture : The theme to the film is also the tune to 'New World' and 'The Next to last Song'. It opens the movie, in a long drawn sequence that is meant to evoke the sentiment that life is one big open canvas.2. Cvalda : The equivalent to 'Its Oh so Quiet' but more musically creative. 'Zing boom' becomes 'Clatter Crash', and when Catherine Deneuve steps in to give Bjork a hand with the vocals, you know that this is an instant masterpiece. Using electronica, machinery, and industrial harmonies, Bjork has managed to do what Tricky and Goldie could not - to create the ultimate example of factory-blend alterna. 'Cvalda' is the perfect song to kick off the soundtrack, and is also the first musical number in the movie.3. I've seen it all - Despite being sung by a different male voice (Thom Yorke, in this case), the track retains its freshness, and while it is certainly novel, it seems rather contrived and formulated - guess they had to have one track on here that stuck with convention and modern rhythm. Lars Von Trier is said to have monitored the making of this song keenly and all the over-interest has not managed to kill it off totally. Its a wonderful orchestral and vocal piece, and the lyrics are beautiful.4. Scatterheart : While this is the most chilling songs on the screen, Bjork insisted on rewriting it for the soundtrack. The result is a hacked, lyrically different version from the one on film. The haunting child vocal ('You just did what you had to do') is replaced by the more pensive 'You just have to find out for yourself' sung by Bjork. This is not bad, but I did miss the original version. The new song also doesn't reveal as much of the storyline as the movie version's does. But of course.5. In the Musicals : This has become one of my favorite Bjork tracks. It is unique and breathtaking, and I have played it over, imagining how Bjork must have constructed such a multi-layered song from scratch. One on hand, the song serves as a fantasy for Selma as she sits in the courtroom while people decide her fate. On another, its a 50s style musical number, the likes of which have not been seen ever. On yet another, its a spiritual hymn thats both uplifting and devastating in its' simplicity. I was awestruck the first time I saw this on screen, and the faithful reproduction on CD is wonderful. Look out for the Gene Kelly-style dance interlude.6. 107 Steps : If you've seen the film, you'll know what happens during this sequence. I can't help skip this track, although beautifully rendered as it brings back too many memories of the film and I am afraid I do not have the strength to sit through those emotions a second time. 'Dancer in the Dark' is the most powerful movie I have ever seen.7. New World : The best song Bjrk has ever recorded. Period. Listeners have noticed that this song is actually 'The Next to last song' with instrumentation and a different meter and placing. Its a soaring ballad, sung from the point of view of a blind woman. Her imagery and sense of perception are so touching and heartbreaking. When the chorus soars as Bjork wraps up the second verse, you know that this is what music is all about. Its not about Madonna, or Eminem or Rolling Stone. Its about being able to breathe and live yourself through your music, and Bjork has done that with this CD. Brilliant and a masterpiece.I initially agreed that this CD was overpriced, but I have come to realize that it is well worth the full price of the album. A small price to pay for such a divine gift. Stunning, a work of art.\n", "val": 0.020963652059435844}
{"text": "This album is certainly a strong departure from the heavily electronic sounds of the wonderful \"homogenic\" to a much more \"Broadway-musical\" scene. But make no mistake, this album has all the things that have made Bjrk so great. However I would suggest that before you buy it you watch the movie first (I've seen it 3 times already). It will give you a much better understanding of the album and you'll appreciate it much more. I bought it before seeing the movie and I liked the album but I absolutely loved it after the movie. The album starts off (like the movie) with \"Overture\" which is a purely instrumental song. The next song, \"Cvlada\", is absolutely brilliant with the music being generated trough the noises in a factory. And Catherine Deneuve does a pretty good job in this song although her voice can't be compared to Bjrk's. Afterwards you'll see the Oscar-nominated \"I've seen it all\". Once again the song is born from ambient sounds being in this case a train. Many Bjrk fans will find this song particularly interesting as it's sang by both Bjrk and Radiohead's vocalist Thom Yorke and as many of you know a lot of people that like Bjrk like Radiohead. Afterwards you have \"Scatterheart\" which is much more electronic than the previous songs. The lyrics on the song are quite different from those in the movie but it's a fantastic song nevertheless. \"In the musicals\" sounds just like its name: A song from a musical but with an excellent percussion and very interesting changes in rhythm. 107 steps is absolutely wonderful. The synchronisation between the woman on the background counting from 1-107 and Bjrk singing specific numbers is fabulous. The album closes with \"New world\" which is based on the rhythm of \"Overture\" but with percussion, electronic sounds and Bjrk's lyrics. I personally regard it as one of the best on the album with an impeccable instrumentation and outstanding vocals.Some people have complained about the album being too short. Though it's some 37 minutes long (If I'm not mistaken) I believe that on the quality aspect there's nothing to complain about it. Maybe if Bjrk had decided to produce a less \"cleaner\" album she could have added the movie version of \"Scatterheart\" as I personally love the part when she sings \"...the time it takes a tear to fall, a snake to shed it's skin, it's all the time that's needed to forgive me...\". She could have also added the song about \"a few of my favourite things\" and the \"next to last song\" would certainly bring tears to my eyes every time I listened to it.But like I mentioned earlier, I strongly recommend that you watch the movie first (Which is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time) and when you exit the theatre buy the CD and I assure you that you'll enjoy it a lot as you'll understand both the lyrics and the sounds of the album. However, if you're not going to see the movie, you'll be missing out on a fantastic movie but you should buy the album anyway. But I can tell you from personal experience that it doesn't sound half as good as it sounds after you've seen it.\n", "val": 0.04886944964528084}
{"text": "By now, we've all come to expect unusual and uncompromising music from Bjork.  And she consistently delivers in both of those areas.  Well, her albums are not so unusual... maybe we just haven't caught up to them yet. Nevertheless, Selmasongs, even if it's only seven songs at 32 minutes, is just as an intense listening experience as you're going to find anywhere.Though there are harsh, mechanical sounds littered throughout, they are rendered quite human by Bjork's voice.  The music itself seems at times like it is duetting with her (never mind that she has an ACTUAL duet with Radiohead's Thom Yorke).  This album is not in any way a stopgap, something to keep fans happy until a REAL album comes out.  No, this is as essential as any of her other albums; an example of her evolving music style.Keep in mind that while it's not necessary to have seen Dancer In The Dark to enjoy and appreciate Selmasongs, it does give you a better understanding of what the songs mean... to see the context in which they were used.  And I will say that having seen the movie, the songs have had a more emotional impact on me.And what about the songs?  Well, first of all there's the Overture, a common device in mucicals, which is a great way to start off the album.  Short and sweet, it serves its purpose and bows out gracefully to make room for the other songs.  It's followed by Cvalda, an inventive number which has Bjork scat singing amid the mechanical clutter and even has Catherine Deneuve chiming in.  I've Seen It All is the Thom Yorke duet and though not a Radiohead fan, this works for me.  It's melancholy but not pessimistic.  Scatterheart sounds like a more traditional Bjork song (whatever that is).  The next one, In The Musicals, is probably my favorite.  It's heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.  107 Steps, thought by some to be filler, is more like a nice two minute vacation away from the rest of the album.  And the final track, New World, is the perfect way to end things.  Very inspired singing by Bjork.My only gripe is the exclusion of Next To Last Song.  Why why why leave this off?  I'm sure they had their reasons (possibly for fear of giving away any part of the story) but still, Selmasongs could have been that much the better for it.  I also would have liked to have seen her rendition of My Favorite Things included as well, but what can you do?  And the versions of songs on the album are different than the ones as heard in the movie, but I like them both, so I'm fine with that (besides, I'll be getting the DVD when it comes out).So what it all comes down to is: do you need Selmasongs?  Well, if you're a Bjork fan, I'm preaching to the choir.  If you have a passive interest in her music, it might serve you well to try this album, though it's certainly not where I would start.  If you've never heard a single Bjork record at all, try Debut.  If you like it, simply work your way up.  I personally find Homogenic her most rewarding, and Selmasongs seems like the next logical step in terms of her music.  Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.015706317499279976}

Some of the songs on here are just crap, and make no sense unless you've seen the movie (I presume).  For example, there's one song where she's basically just counting.  My guess is that has something to do with dancing, but as a single listening to it in your car, there's not much appeal.  This CD isn't worth the money as far as I'm concerned.  You're better off with Debut, or the Great Crossover Potential (by the Sugarcubes).

I have been a listener since purchasing her DVD Volumen online, and cannot say how much I appreciate her music.  However, with Selmasongs, you get an extremely personal view of Bjork's interpretation of who Selma (from the film) really is.  The music may seem stark and rather depressing but the more you listen the further you get into Selma and Bjork's artistry.  And also, this CD is rather short, but it is so pakced with artistry that it makes up for it's brevity.  And didn't Shakespeare write \"brevity is the soul of wit\"?.

As far as the soundtrack goes, I appreciate Bjork's endeavor in keeping it the way she wanted as much as possible however, as I was sitting in the theater I kept making a stir and whispering to a friend I had  met there... my main contention:  Why was the soundtrack different than the movie?  I had purchased the CD a month prior to viewing the film but couldn't find it playing in Georgia(big surprise!) and was used to the lyrics, but during the film I kept hoping it would follow the soundtrack more.  Yet to no avail.  Notable difference I wish would come out in a true to movie version: 1.  Jeff's voice would have been heard and the train workers in I'VE SEEN IT ALL 2. In the movie Selma's boy sings \"you just did what you had to do\"  but in the soundtrack you hear \"you're going to have to find out for yourself\" the former makes more sense after seeing the movie and is truly one of the most haunting things I have ever seen in a film  3. Joel Gray's voice was omitted from IN THE MUSICALS, why? and lastly 4. THE NEXT TO LAST SONG was ommited, this should definetly be in the soundtrack.  Anyway much praise for Bjork, Lars and Catherine.  American filmakers should take heed and be a little more realistic with our movies and not always give them happy endings, it makes for a sad yet impressive impact on you.  Dancer in the dark is no different...  Furthermore,  I think Bjork has raw talent and was very convincing.  I do feel bad for her best friend who I recently heard in the icelandic version of the musical HAIR (GREAT STUFF!!)  called \"Harith\" who is also very talented.  Her friend has been acting and working at it her whole life and Bjork being the talent that she is, does her first major picture (aside from THE JUNIPER TREE of course)and wins all these awards yet doesn't even really care about acting.  WOW!! That is raw talent.  And finally on a side note fans of Bjork should also check out the Icelandic band Sigur-ros, they are truly innovative and years ahead of their time.\n", "val": 0.0122698824852705}
{"text": "I usually don't like to review CD's that already have been reviewed extensively. I usually don't go for soundtracks either. So why do this? Well I'd just like to throw my opinion into the mix because it is an exceptional piece of music. Different from some of her previous releses this one stands alone making another strong statement from an artist who is hard to nail down. Bjork challenges herself and the listner. Coming directly from the movie most might think that you'd have to see the movie first. Not neccessarily, I have not seen the movie and thouroughly enjoy the music. I heard it first in a record store and just loved it. Very cabaret, hints of techno, a modern \"Ginger Rogers\" and \"Fred Astaire\" come flying off the CD, it is totally different. The style reminds me of something \"Laurie Anderson\" and \"Peter Gabriel\" might have collaborated on and concieved. Very modern yet nostalgic in it's presentation this CD encourages further exploration. If the music is this  good the movie must be quite interesting. Bjork's vocal stylings are impressive as she fluctuates and recoils, whispering at times, belting out at others, jagged and uneven tempos that harmonize and fit like pixel images becoming clearer with time until they come into full crystal clear, digital aural view, true artistry defined. The orchestration is beautiful, at times with a Latin sound, an urban drumming sound, cascading notes mixed with sounds that are dreamy than suddenly, abruptly edgy. This is an excellent CD that I imagine will sound even better when I see the film. Bjork apparently had glowing reviews and won the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival but hated the acting experience so much that she says ahe will not act again. Her artistry will shine whatever her evdeavor. The soundtrack to \"Dancer in the Dark\" creates beautiful aural images that can only be further enhanced upon seeing the film.\n", "val": 0.022771839052438736}

I can understand that in order for Bjork to realize her role as Selma, she needed to immerse herself to the point of exhuastion, if not depression. Only in this way could she create music that can transform you from most horrendous and depressive circumstances and experiences, and immerse you into a musical world. The singularity of instrumentation, the rhythms and singing make me want to let the steering wheel go and dance my heart away. I cry, I laugh, I dance. I imagine how life could be if...

{"text": "As I was sitting in the theatre, watching Dancer in the Dark, I knew I couldn't help myself from buying Selmasongs, I knew it wouldn't be right to even try to.  The music in Von Trier's movie is beautiful, and determined to deliver: it throws itself at you, and you can't help loving it (especially if you know and support Bjrk's previous albums).  So, as I said, I was compelled to buy it.I didn't get too far into the listening before I realized that the CD I had brought home from the record store was in many ways different from the \"real\" score of Dancer in the Dark.  I was puzzled for about one second, when it finally stroke me that the omissions and variations to the soundtrack could be rationally motivated:(1)first of all, it was obviously in the record company's own interest that the album  be self-standing, likely to please not only those who would go see the movie, but a more general public (mostly made up of Bjrk fans, I suppose);(2)secondly, if no one was to know what the movie was going to be about before its release (as Von Trier demanded), Selmasongs - available in stores no less than a month before the movie was out - had to be vague enough to not give the movie's ending away.I was tickled by my discovery, and I appreciated the sense of humour behind the marketing process of Von Trier's film.  Selmasongs, as I see it, (quite ironically) was an \"appetizer,\" a simplified version of the real thing - beautiful no less, but undeniably incomplete.This point needs to be clear: from a strictly musical (i.e. \"instrumental\") point of view, Selmasongs is completely untainted...  What differs is: the lyrics to some of the songs, their length, and - very important - the number of performing \"voices.\"  I don't want to be misunderstood: the music on the record is so powerful anyone will find it hard to resist its charm, and - for those of us who did see the film - it serves its purpose just fine: it brings Dancer in the Dark back to life.  Selmasongs is a great album and it will make any competent listener happy.  That's why I have no doubt about it fully deserving five stars.However, I feel that more could and should be drawn from the movie, especially now that there's nothing left to \"hide.\"  In other words, I think Bjrk's score, as we hear it in the theatre, should also be made available on CD.  No doubt it would be harder to listen to, particularly for those who choose not to see the movie, but it would gain in expressiveness, complexity, and, consequently, profoundness.  The chorus singing in \"I Have Seen It All,\" the duets in \"Scatterheart\" and \"In the Musicals,\" as well as the \"Next to Last Song\" as a whole, need to get the attention they deserve.  I feel only the real and yet unpublished soundtrack of Dancer in the Dark could truly put Bjrk in the limelight of contemporary \"story-telling through music.\"(A question for those Americans who got a chance to see Dancer in the Dark: what do you think about it and particularly its ending?  I would really like to find out whether Americans support the you know what or not...)\n", "val": 0.0035939656663686037}

{"text": "Take heed from a guy who never owned a Bjork CD before buying this \"soundtrack\": this is great stuff.Someone had passed me a Bjork single of a Deodato mix of \"Isobel\" years back and I liked it and recognized her talent, but it took this film and the accompanying 'score' to wake me up and take notice (as I bark like Catherine Deneuve does in the opening scene of the film, a sly reference itself to 'The Sound of Music' - the last musical anyone in America allowed to be a musical without dismissing it).Yes, I do wish Selmasongs was in the truest sense a 'soundtrack' of \"Dancer in the Dark\"... maybe that one is in the pipeline someday soon.  Bjork has remixed and dubbed many of the songs to be different than heard in the film, itself an agonizing, witty, frustrating, iconoclastic, and at-times brilliant and self-reflexive meditation on the cultural murder of the musical by Industry and the 'chic cynicism' propogated by a media that would rather seduce people into buying SUVs, and look down on smaller cars, rather than have them feel deep and beautiful things.  All that said, Bjork still provides 37 quality minutes of a modern musical.It's subjective of course to choose a highlight here, but for my money it's \"I've Seen It All\", a lovely duet with Radiohead's Thom Yorke.  I do regret the male chorus is missing from the film musical segment (possibly one of the most exquisite moments in cinema of the last ten years this side of Kieslowski).  Siobahn Fallon's counting on \"107 Steps\" chills for anyone who has seen the film as Bjork marches bravely towards the Death of the Musical.  The bulk of the material is orchestrated grandly by Vince Mendoza (the genius on Joni Mitchell's \"Both Sides Now\") and the underlying techno-beat emerges from Bjork's film role-plight as a lowly worker in a hellish sink factory.\"Selmasongs\" moved me to research previous Bjork efforts, many of which I like and will purchase.  As for its length and truncation, well, the lady is still a brilliant artist.

Don't worry, SS hasn't changed my intention to see the film as soon as damn well possible, but as a mini-album in it's own right, it doesn't quite stand up.Why Yorke was asked to do vox for this version of \"I've Seen It All\" I've no idea - his voice ruins the track for me, I would much rather Peter Stormare's vox were present....  Further there is the fact that there's only just over 30 minutes of material here, the first 3 being a rather dull overture that sounds like it has been taken straight from \"Yet Another Derivative Hollywood Orchestral Film Soundtrack.\"  The final nail in the coffin as it were, has to be that many (stores) are charging full album prices for it....  argh....Which is a shame, since I'd argue with anyone that Cvalda is one of the single greatest songs Bjork has ever written; and whilst I wouldn't place any of tracks 4 and onwards quite up to the same standard, they aren't far off.Ultimately Gling-Glo seems to do more for me personally..., and Homogenic is still my personal fave, but even so no Bjork fan in their right mind would skip this EP (because, let's face it, that's what it is), and I will certainly try and get my hands on the Japanese import.3.5/5 I think - too short, two rather poor tracks (1 and 3), and by the sounds of it, missing vital tracks from the film.\n", "val": 4.923836240777746e-05}
{"text": "Recently, I thought I'd had an epiphany. In a conversation with a good friend, I came to the conclusion that there are two kinds of popular music fans: those who think Bjork is the greatest female artist of our time and those who think Madonna is the greatest female artist of our time. Consequently, when I learned that \"Customers who bought this title also bought: * Music ~ Madonna,\" I was more than a little surprised.Let me explain. It isn't much of a stretch to suggest that Bjork and Madonna are two sides of the same coin, strong women with singular visions (and single names) who have, over the past few years, pushed their different flavors of Pop Music into the realm of Electronica, garnering critical acclaim and devoted fans. Somehow, working in the same genre with many of the same influences, these two have managed to create music at the opposite extremes of the spectrum. And, ironically, their latest efforts were released simultaneously. I got \"Selmasongs\" the day it was released, my good friend got \"Music\" (the Limited Edition, no less), and we both got into a heated argument defending our purchases to each other.Here's the deal: \"Selmasongs\" has moments of brilliance, and the rest of it is still exceptional, somehow managing, in spite of its dramatic orchestral arrangements and \"found sound\" rhythm tracks, to feel grounded and uplifting without sounding pretentious. It's only flaw is in its fleeting nature; the music seems to come and go so quickly that the echoes of the \"Overture\" in the final track, \"New World,\" make it seem as if you've only heard a single song. Of course, it is short, correctly described as an EP (despite having the price tag of an LP), but it feels even shorter than its 32 minutes, 14 seconds. As flaws go, it's not as bad as including a lyric like \"Hey Mister Deejay, put a record on/I want to dance with my baby,\" and it shouldn't stop you from picking up this little masterpiece, but it is worth mentioning.\n", "val": 0.012526408769190311}

Qui si parla del disco, naturalmente, ma credo si possa essere d'accordo che senza Bjork musicista (per non parlare dell'attrice...) il film non sarebbe esistito (qualcuno dice che, nonostante le musiche, non esiste neanche adesso). Il disco  bellissimo, pieno di quelle vitalit che Bjork sembra poter trasmettere a qualunque cosa tocchi. E si sente, come gi dalle prime battute del film - quelle per intenderci dove lo schermo  \"ancora\" nero e gli spettatori non smettono di chiaccherare... - che non stiamo parlando di una cantante, pur bravissima, ma di una vera e propria musicista, di un'artista completa. L'Overture, assai semplice,  magnifica. Senti un uso degli ottoni insieme ai timpani che con un brivido ti fa ricordare quel filo che da Mahler (penso alle battute finali della Terza) sale fino ai nordici...Grieg, Sibelius, Nielsen...sono attimi, inutile dilungarsi, ma capisci che questa ragazza ha visto il loro stesso cielo, e con lo stesso sguardo.  Delle musiche, tutte bellissime, vorrei dire qualcosa a proposito di \"I've seen it all\": vi ricordate le ultime parole di Roy, il replicante di \"Blade runner\" (\"ho visto delle cose che voi umani...\"), anche lui uno che non potr presto vedere pi nulla? Fate un confronto. Bjork parla di cose cos piccole da essere immense, fa star male...\"ho visto un uomo tradito dal suo migliore amico\"...altro che le porte di Tannhauser e i raggi gamma! La voce di Bjork-Selma in questo pezzo  molto particolare: sta piangendo? sta ridendo?  rassegnata? soddisfatta? cosa vive di quel \"tutto\" che ha visto?  tutto ci che c' da vedere? o  \"tutto\" quel che suoi poveri occhi hanno potuto vedere? e non  forse la stessa cosa? Questa musica, forse anche perch nel film si accompagna alla coreografia pi bella, ti entra dentro e non vuole uscirsene pi. Si sviluppa sul ritmo di un treno lento e pesante. Implacabile. Quasi tutti i pezzi, del resto, si aprono con rumori, rumori ritmici o che diventano tali nella testolina di Selma, che da qui prende ogni volta le mosse per danzare nel buio.

{"text": "I have been a huge fan of Bjork since I first heard POST/1995 (Hyperballad,  Its Oh So Quiet, Married to myself,Possibly may be...) and as I listened to her more and more, Debut/1993 (Venus as a Boy,One Day,Come to me..),Telegram/1996,Homegenic/1997 (Hunter,Immature..) Bjork landed in a special place in my limited  but diverse roster of favorite artists (Mariah Carey, Macy Gray, Etta James,James Taylor,Sting among the few).When I saw that the \"Dancer in the Dark\" soundtrack had only 7 tracks I was a bit disspointed but it is well worth the full price I paid since all the songs and tracks on the album have been so beautifully and intelligently performed and produced by BJORK. My favorites starting w/ the best are:1. New World.(Only Bjork can take this ballad to its cinematic  climax the way it does) 2. In the Musicals.(Those who think Bjork is irritating will see the flipside and realize how wrong they are in this song) 3.107 Steps.(Another somber and moving track that ends w/ a tragic yet climatic melody) 4. Cvalda. (The intro to this song w/ the heavy machine sound...I thought it was neat....may seem acerbic to some people but wait until you hear the entire catchy tune. In this song Bjork leaves the ballads and returns to her trademark free spirited, girlish tantrum throwing style that only she can do so well. Catherine Deneuve's participation is also a plus) 5. I've Seen It All. The duet of the album, w/ Thom Torke, shows that Bjork, who normally doesn't sing duets,can do that very well indeed. This song has a depressing tone but that only helps convey the story underlying Dancer in the Dark. 6. Overture. The non vocal extravaganza that opens the album is very movie like and apt to the movie's sad theme 7. Scatter Heart. I like the starting of this track more than the ending.Overall this is an excellent EP. It still would have been a lot better w/ a few more tracks and if it included the lyrics and may be even some pictures from  the movie(hence the 4 stars). Thats why I can't wait until Bjork comes out w/ her next full studio album, DOMESTICA, next year,I have also heard that Bjork's extraordinary acting in Dancer In the Dark is generating a lot of Oscar Buzz (she has already won the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actress award earlier this year). Even though she announced after winning that award that she will never act again and rather devote the next 50 years in creating beautiful music, I hope she changes her mind and showcases her talent both in music and acting.\"Selmasongs\" does actually grow on you but any Bjork fan or fan- to-be should love this album from the get go.\n", "val": 0.014711170457303524}

It's possible for the cd to stand on its own, but it gains in emotional power if you know what happens in the movie.With that being said I was highly disappointed that it wasn't fully faithful to the movie version of the songs. While I enjoyed hearing Catherine Denueve on 'Cvalde' I would rather have had Peter Stormare's vocals for 'I've Seen It All' and the original version of 'Scatterheart' You'll find some lyric switching between Yorke and Bjork in 'I've Seen It All' and the lyrics for 'Scatterheart' barely resemble that which was sung in the movie.The greatest tragedy of all with this cd is the omission of 'The Next to Last Song'. A powerful moment in the movie is completely lost on this cd, rendering '107 Steps' and 'A New World' not as powerful as they were in the theater. Don't get me wrong though, you'll still find yourself moved by these tracks, but the moment is not complete without 'The Next to Last Song'.I can only hope that somewhere down the line a more complete soundtrack will be released or the DVD will offer a music only track.

{"text": "Not quite the departure it's been reported, on Selmasongs Bjrk adapts her everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink style to six songs and musical overture from Lars Von Trier's film `Dancer in the Dark'.  \"Pastiche\" is what it was called in the old days.  The industrial clatter of \"Cvalda\" turns into a toe-tapping Busby Berkeley homage.  A leaving train becomes the insistent rhythm of the aching Thom Yorke duet \"I've Seen It All\".  Due to the restraints of film narrative the lyrics, with help from Von Trier, are more straightforward than usual, which frees Bjrk to concentrate her prodigious talents on an  extraordinary vocal performance.  Reports from the set were that she and Von Trier came to loggerheads due to the painful nature of the story (at one point, she left the film), but you can hear Bjrk's joy in every syllable of these songs, her absolute love of old MGM musicals, and her own goofy imagination.

Her escapes into the music her mind creates fulfill her girlish dreams of one day being a star in a musical.  However, the sounds that create this world in her mind do not come from violins or trumpets, but from industrial machinery, trains and a jumping 33rpm record for example, just like in Bjork's real-life world.  Every little click, bang, thump becomes an element of Selma's musical world, and gradually degenerate into a full-fledged composition or show-tune with full choreography and special effects.As in most of Bjork's compositions, the sounds are unusual, original and surprising, challenging your mind to go beyond the accepted musical boundaries.  In addition, with this recording, Bjork almost redifines the concept of \"soundtracks\", which for the last few years have tended to be composed of songs that have no relation to the film what-so-ever.  In this case, the film could not exist without the music, even if the music can still perfectly stand on its own.

{"text": "Bjork's new cd Selmasongs, while only 32 minutes, is as eclectic as you would expect from the singer. A companion cd for Lars Von Trier's film Dancer In The Dark, Bjork's award-winning acting debut, Selmasongs features the songs she sings as her character Selma (well, that's sort of obvious). The movie is about Czech immigrant Selma's struggle to save her son from a disease that causes blindness while keeping her spirits up dreaming about her beloved Hollywood musicals during her work in an American factory. 'Cvalda' is an energetic mix of industrial sounds and big band flourishes, perfectly illustrating Selma's fantasy world in the factory environment, adding a John Cage quality to Bjork's already highly original songwriting, and if it weren't kooky enough, there are vocal contributions by Catherine Deneuve. 'Scatterheart''s electronic cadences sound like the closest thing to a true follow-up to Bjork's Homogenic, while 'In The Musicals' seamlessly blends stuttering rhythms (you can just picture her tapdancing) and lilting string arrangements while Bjork sings her typical wide-eyed, whimsical lyrics.  Selmasongs will be most remembered, however, for the sensational duet between Bjork and Radiohead's Thom Yorke. Yorke & Bjork (now there's a catchy name for a duo!) exchange a dialogue while an orchestral score and the rhythm of a train swirl around them. The lyrics are Bjork at her usual sublime self: \"You've never been to Niagara Falls?/I have seen water, its water, that's all.../The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State?/My pulse was as high on my very first date!\" Dancer In The Dark is a film that has film critics split down the middle: either you love it or you hate it.

Beautifully orchestrated, magically composed,  masterfully arranged. We've finally found the purpose for Her music. Only Bjork  can successfully marry a techno-pop-like beat to the most gorgeous string and horn  arrangements -- simply amazing!All of the songs are written by Bjork along with someone else. Vincent Mendoza  (who arranged each piece with Bjork) expertly compliments Bjork's musical genius  with his sumptuous orchestration. A match made in heaven.My two favorites, by far, are \"New World\" and \"I've Seen It All.\" The strings in  New World will take your breath away and, while the orchestration of I've Seen It  All can make you cry I don't care too much for the male vocals (Radiohead's Thom  Yorke). They do lend a realism that's lost in many musicals. Everyday-Joes don't  sing like Fred Astaire.Honorable mentions go the \"107 Steps\" -- very imaginative. Only Bjork can make  counting steps seem like a roller coaster ride.How her talent can continue to improve upon itself is beyond me, but she has and  can only continue to improve.\n", "val": 0.028752747923135757}
{"text": "&#65279;  The classic theme of the \"City\" being unnatural and without compassion reoccurs as a conflict within Selma/Bjork in the film and also within the music of  Selmasongs. Outside Selma is the harsh reality of her existence. Inside Selma is a fantasy world void of jackhammers, blindness, and the death penalty.  Likewise, the musical numbers are in conflict between the metallic, polluted sounds of the city and the swooping, rich strings and the playful xylophones in Selmas mind. Bjork and Mark Bell weave these two competing \"realities\" into a seamless congruent whole that broadens the definition of a Musical; as did Alban Berg to Operas, and Pierre Schaeffer to everyday recorded sounds (Musique Concrete). It seems, just now, that the progression of electronic avant garde music of the 20th  century is being used to further the expressive power of the 21st century musical.  Aaron Copeland is smiling today.\n", "val": 0.010117673315107822}
{"text": "Bjork and Lars Van Trier combine forces in both a film, and an album. Calling this new album simply \"Selmasongs\" is almost a mistake. It states on the back that it's the soundtrack to Dancer In The Dark, however, it stands alone as a Bjork album. But from the first track it is clear this is a musical, with the orchestral overture. The second track, but really should be considered the first song we get the perfect opener to any musical. It's catchy, you want to sing right along with Bjork, \"CRASH WHACK BAM!\" The most surprising part of this song being the second verse sung by Catherine Deneuve. The opener is ear catching and dancy. It's followed by a duet with Thom York. I was weary at first hearing that Thom York would be joining Bjork on this song, because I find that with Radiohead it can be hit and miss at times. But it works well, and being the duet, is a completely necessary song for the movie to really embrace the idea of a musical. The lyrics are give and take discussion between Thom York and Bjork. \"Have you seen niagra falls?\" \"I have seen water, it's water, that's all.\" The song begins with the sounds of train tracks, which then morph themselves into the underlying beat throughout the song. The most telling song on the album is \"In The Musicals\" in which Bjork sings strictly about how much she loves the musicals. I wish I could see right now what is happening on the screen at parts, in which it goes into a series of different percussions, that seem like they would be the perfect song and dance scene with random people doing their own moves. The most haunting track I find is \"107 Steps\" in that the lyrics are so simple. It's counting up to, and I believe past 107. It starts with a rythmic counting, and Bjork interjects, singing along various numbers as well. The album appropriately ends with a variation on the overture with vocals. Beautifully written and performed. The lyrics are near perfection \"If living is seeing, I'm holding my breath.\" The album as a whole is an unstoppable combination of songwriting in the grand style of the musical, with incredible beats and DJing underlying the whole thing. The orchestral sound that you would get from a musical is underplayed, or more, that the electronic equipment is taking over the task of the majority of the orchestration. And incredible album, and sure to be an incredible film.\n", "val": 0.017712553963065147}

I'm sorry, that's just unacceptable. it should cost 10.00 tops. If I wasn't such a huge fan, I wouldn't have touched this. Content wise, this is a long shot from her best and a far cry from essential. \"Homogenic\" was a masterwork and remains in my \"Top 10\" of all time list. I also still listen to it at least weekly. \"Debut\" is another all time favorite... The rest of them are not as great, but this is the first Bjork release I've been out and out disapointed with. The first track is a throw-away instrumental theme that could be anybody's. \"I've seen it all\" is pretty great, but we're not breaking new ground here. Other than that, there are spots that are good... usually parts of songs rather than whole songs. Overall, I really could have passed on this, especailly at the price. still, it's better than most of the major label junk you'll find out there.

{"text": "Let me get my two disappointments out of the way up front.  First, the disc is only 30 minutes long; for WEA to charge as if it were a full CD or an import is the best argument for Napster I've seen in a while.  Second, this is a soundtrack, with music meant for a movie; the first track, \"Overture\", is exactly what it says it is.Those quibbles aside, it's great to have new music from Bjork again.  She's lost none of her musical quirkiness, rhythmic savvy, or lyrical playfulness; her voice, always a fascinating instrument, sounds unusually mature and controlled (maybe the influence of the character she's playing).  None of the songs here quite reach the stratospheric heights of Homogenic, which combined of-the-moment club music with traditional Icelandic song structures, and is far and away her most impressive work.  But I can think of no more beautiful moment in Bjork's recording career than the second time when she sings the refrain to \"New World\" while the drums kick in and the orchestra swells around her.  At least three songs here have similar shivery moments that almost make this CD worth its FTC-baiting price tag.The duet with Thom Yorke deserves special mention.  It is, of course, a preview of great things still to come next month.  It's also a clever, haunting and instantly likable song, which prompts the question:  why doesn't truly good, serious music like this make it on to the radio any more?  This would be the slogan of my fantasy radio station:  \"It's ear candy ... and so much more.\"  That's how I've thought of Bjork ever since her \"Birthday\" days, and this sweet little morsel is no exception.\n", "val": 0.009776458144187927}

With this album she has brought the movie soundtrack to a whole new level!  Bjork has taken old 40 and 50's musical pieces and added her own electronic twist.  I've been waiting for something new from Bjork with great anticipation(of course her singles and remixes are usually great)  Of course this is not your typical Bjork album.  She Is her Selma character from her film Dancer in the Dark.  But any Bjork fan or movie soundtrack fan should deffinatley invest in this masterpiece of modern music.The entire cd, is of course very good, some tracks will have to grow on you but do not worry.....they will.  Then you can not get enough of them.  Some exceptional tracks are \"I've seen it all\"  \"Scatterheart\" and \"In the Musicals.\" \"I've seen it all\" sticks out because of the duet between two musical geniuses with breathe taking vocals........of course I'm talking about Bjork and Thom Yorke(for those of you who do not know who this is.....it is the  lead singer from Radiohead)!\"Scatterheart\" is a very absorbing piece........very sad and heartfelt......great lyrics.\"In the Musicals\" is a very light and playful song with great sounds that intertwine with great string compositions.Of course like all of Bjorks albums, this one also has great artwork on the front(and the inside sleeve has an even more amazing picture of Bjork....which i hope will eventually become a poster)I could talk all day about Bjork and this album but as the song \"Scatterheart\" says.... \"You are gonna have to find out for yourself.\"\n", "val": 0.036436427384614944}

It's important to realize that these songs weren't written as musical numbers, but as a Czech factory worker's vision of musical numbers.  On that level, the soundtrack is endlessly intriguing, full of sharp turns and new surprises during every listen.Not having seen the film, I expect \"New World\" and \"I've Seen it All\" will be emotional high points, although early buzz indicates the real reason to see the film is Bjork's acting performance.  If anyone is going to breathe fresh air into the musical genre, it is Bjork, and I'm eager to see how Lars Von Trier incorporates this landmark of the Icelander's career into his film.\n", "val": 0.031489789485931396}

{"text": "On the surface, this CD does not have much going for it. Firstly, it is bound to be compared with the magnificent \"Homogenic\". Secondly, it is a Soundtrack album (very few artists have been able to navigate these treacherous waters). Thirdly, it was written under the well-documented stress of making the movie. It has also been roundly panned by some music critics who usually  are foaming at the mouth in adulation at her work. Having now heard it, some pluses should be mentioned. Firstly, \"Selmasongs\" does not contain anything remotely as awful (imho) as \"It's Oh so quiet\", or as superfluous (again, imho) as \"Someone in Love\", two \"Show tune\" songs from previous albums. There is also a cohesiveness here sometimes lacking in Bjork's other work. One of the problems with Bjork (everyone should be so lucky) is that she is only intermittently brilliant. \"Debut\" was 1/4 brilliant, \"Post\" was 1/2 brilliant, \"Homogenic\" 3/4 brilliant. This tends to lead to albums that are excellent, but feel unbalanced. \"Selmasongs\" is not the 100% brilliant album she is capable of making. Perhaps being freed from an acting career will push her to write it. What \"Selmasongs\" is, is consistently good, sometimes very good.

The best songs on it are the  hauntingly touching \"I've Seen It All\", a duet with Radiohead's  Thom York, and \"In The Musicals\" which is about her character's  hiding from reality by daydreaming her musicals.This album is more  accessable then some of Bjork's other work, and is definately brighter in  it's tone. It is one of those rare soundtracks that stands alone as a  striking piece of music, and also compliments the film to perfection.

{"text": "Bjork is poised to become a multi-media superstar.  Her latest album,  \"Selmasongs\" doubles as  a collection of songs from her first  movie, Dancer in the Dark.  She has won critical acclaim for her work in  the film as a mother who works in a factory and labors to save her son from  a disease that will cause  him to go blind.  The premise of the seven songs  on this EP deals with her character's ability to keep her spirits up by  fantasizing about musicals.  The songs sound like something out of a  postmodern Rodgers and Hammerstein with Bjork's careening vocals lending  weight to compositions that  fuse industrial clatter and dream-like,  sweeping string arrangements.  Whats more significant is that these songs  feel  as if they come from a created persona that Bjork fully embodies in  both the film and throughout the soundtrack. She never breaks from  character and the songs soar because of the emotion she has invested in  each track.  Bjork's co-star Catherine Deneuve makes a vocal cameo for the  track \"Cvalda\".  Thom Yorke's duet with Bjork, the moody  \"I've Seen it All\" is a warm moment where he the question is  posed, \"What about China?  Have you seen the Great Wall?\"  Yorke  responds,  \"All walls are great if the roof doesnt fall.\"  This  statement unknowingly parallels the plight of Bjork's charachter, Selma who  seems cute and carefree in the film's outset only later to be seen as  dilusional and the victim of the wall she has constructed against her own  crushing reality.  Her imagination/wall cannot save her from the life she  must face.  As the album continues, it reaches its emotional zenith with  the glorious, \"In the Musicals 1&2\".  Then, the album finds  closure with the companion piece to the album's opening,  \"Overture\", the cascading \"New World\" finds Bjork  cooing a few verses over spiralling strings and raindrop beats echoing the  opening melody.  The album's songs feel like  the soundtrack to some  feverish mid-afternoon nap with Bjork's voice playing the part of the woman  you encounter in your dreams repeatedly and whose name you never seem to  learn.  Selmasongs tracks cut and flow effortlessly like oil on the  bearings of a well made machine.

{"text": "I remember the song from my youth as an autistic child in the 1960's.  \"To Sir With Love\" was the title song to a movie of the same name.  The movie chronicled a class of poor to working class family 1960's era inner city tough rebellious high school students.  Sidney Poitier attempting to teach these kids respect for humanity, authority and themselves required the kids to call him sir as a metter of basic respect.  Of course there was lots of struggle and contention as the kids rebelled against the lessons Sir attempted to instill in these children.  Over time Sir won the hearts and souls of the kids and in respect as a gift to him this song was the result.To Sir With Love is sung with such passion that it could easily bring me to tears today if I allow it.  Movies about the transformation of wayward people into good people always inspire and move me deeply.  Society had given up on these kids but, Sir saw the potential for greatness in each of them.  Growing up autistic I never knew what to make of teachers, they always seemed to be my enemy.  To Sir With Love at least gave me the ideal the truly great teachers were supposed to be aiming for.I purchased this To Sir With Love MP3 because; like so many others it marks a key point in my development and understanding of humanity, culture and education.  Being a child with autism the true purpose of school elluded me for a very long time.  To Sir With Love explained the purpose of school by showing the ideal teacher who overcomes all obsticles to insure his students leave high school ready to embrace the world of college or work.\n", "val": 0.014798475429415703}

{"text": "In reading reviews posted for the group \"Nutting But Stringz\" found a bit of confusion going on so wanted to post this review under Black Violin since many seemed to have watched the same Episode of CSI:NY I did,during which 2 awesome pcs of violin music were played during 2 parts of the Episode. After viewing the Episode(titled\"Murder Sings The Blues)during which heard the wonderful musical talents of a group called \"Black Violin\",appears many others like myself were totally smitten w/what they heard & went searching for a CD of what is actually Black Violin's music,ending up instead in purchasing a copy of the Nuttin But Stringz CD.Appears some somehow got lead to this other awesome young duo of wonderful violinists who I personally believe are absolutely wonderful as well. But if you were specifically looking for the group who performed the 2 awesome violin pcs played during the above Episode of CSI:NY,my internet searches at the time the Episode aired yielded the info that those 2 violin pcs were actually performed by Black Violin. Discovered the 2 songs played during the Episode were I believe from info retrieved \"Brandenburg\" (when Mac is @ the Opera & \"Jammin\"(On The Blue Train) which is the pc played when everyone is partying on the train/the murder takes place. Thinking was going to be easy to purchase full CD of Black Violin's music,checked Amazon.com but found full CD only avail via MP3 download. Found same thing @ the time in ckng Black Violin's website @ [...].Just found actual copy of their CD on Ebay. Paid more than usual,but went ahead & purchased the CD being excited to finally find a copy. Turns out I believe you can now get actual copies of Black Violin's CDs on their website so for those interested,just might want to check it out if it was the music played during the Episode of CSI:NY you were/are looking for. Been listening to the CD & it's just wonderful! Incredible talent bringing to the world the most wonderful blend of the most exceptional classical violin talent coupled w/ the sound of today's hip hop. I hope that many will hear the music of these young men so that their eyes will hopefully be opened to just exactly what people of all cultures are capable of & how much talent there is bridging the gap. I find Black Violin an absolutely exceptional & extremely impressive duo & hope they keep going. Hope haven't provided any misinformation here. Thx for the opportunity to share..Donna\n", "val": 0.0001172831398434937}

It wasn't the bluesy style that I had anticipated but she impressed me none the less. So much so that I've since purchased her later release, \"Singing For My Supper\", bringing my total number of Beth Hart albums to four (these two and the two she recorded with Joe Bonamassa). Having compared her earliest work with the two albums she recorded with Joe I can easily understand why they collaborate so well. They both have such great range of style. Beth's vocal talent allows her to coo as softly and sweetly as a Norah Jones and at the same time she possesses the powerful rasp of a Janice Joplin. From her older rock-oriented material to her latest blues efforts, I have yet to hear anything from Beth that I don't like and plan to collect her entire catalog. She's a beautiful and talented performer and were it not for Joe Bonamassa I would never have heard of her.

{"text": "First, I must take exception to the other reviewer who claims this is not the original Stealers Wheel version of this song.He claims this is the version re-recorded by some of the studio musicians who performed with Gerry Rafferty and Joe Egan for the original recording sessions of this song.He's wrong, I believe because he confused this REMASTERED version with a RE-RECORDED version.My evidence is right here -&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stuck-In-The-Middle-With-You-Re-Recorded-Remastered/dp/B0044BKH72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stuck In The Middle With You (Re-Recorded / Remastered)</a>As you can see, the above link is for a re-recording, something quite different from a simple remaster.A REMASTER is an original recording taken from the best fully mixed master transferred to the digital medium with the best possible techniques and digital to analog converters to ensure the best sound quality to the consumer.A RE-RECORDING, on the other hand, consists of a completely new mix and performance committed to a totally new master for the music consumer, in this case with neither Mr. Rafferty nor Mr. Egan being involved.I don't mean to sound as if I am flaming the reviewer here, but I believe that accuracy is important, and that the Rafferty estate and the still living Joe Egan should get all the royalties they so richly deserve for this excellent song.Reckless claims regarding the authenticity of this song would definitely jeopardize purchases, and thus those royalties.Okay, back to my review.This song is just so infectious, with its handclap percussion section and bit of steel guitar accents, but it's the late Gerry Rafferty's slightly nasal soft tenor voice that really carries this along.It's just one of those songs that will get anyone's toe tapping and head bobbing along.Anyone familiar with the movie \"Reservoir Dogs\" will vividly recall this song's use in a key scene that features some extremely graphic violence, and this upbeat tune only accentuates that scene.Please don't let that particular movie ruin this magnificent song for you, though.This song was also featured in the movie \"Roadhouse,\" with Jeff Healy covering it and nicely executing some aggressive bottleneck work on his guitar, played with his customary style, held face up across his lap.Another thing that should come as a real surprise to the listener is that both this song and Gerry Rafferty's song \"Baker Street\" are Rafferty compositions.The contrast in styles and lyrical content between the two could not be much different, with \"Baker Street\" having a far more downbeat tone until the closing verse.Sadly, Gerry Rafferty is no longer with us, as of last week.However, his excellent music will live on, and the Scottish people (yes, Rafferty was one) should be proud of that.\n", "val": 0.0004671594360843301}

Most of the arrangements are nice (except for Greensleeves--which would have been much better minus the uninteresting cello part) and performed adequately but my biggest gripe is how Austin has named the tracks.Hills of Heather - Haunting and Bittersweet Celtic Theme.  This really should have attributed as \"Wild Mountain Thyme\", \"Will ye go, Lassie go?\", or \"Purple Heather\" somewhere.  These are all titles by which this song is famously known.  A search on \"Hills of Heather song\" doesn't return a match for any of these titles (I didn't look past the first page of matches), just the track by Craig Austin.  I believe there is at least one Turlogh O'Carolan song also (Carolan's Quarrel with the Landlady).The point being, since there are no album notes, and no attribution to the actual traditional tunes, good luck finding sheet music or recordings by other artists.Better to spend a dollar or two more and get better acclaimed artist recordings with proper attribution.\n", "val": 5.770503412350081e-05}

In other words, these are the times of Green Day input. Undoubtedly this was protest, not punk. I did download the MP3 from this site but not to cherry pick.

Often times I lose interest, forget to go back, or get the one song I like and move on to newer and greener pastures.  After I got this one song, I got curious what the rest of the album was like.  I had been burned before by artists who had one or two good songs and I had taken a chance on their album and made the big purchase, so I was skeptical.  I went to the artists website and I listened to each song in his set.  I immediately loved this album.  It is slow and melodic.  His style reminds me a bit of a modern Bob Dylan, without the weird inflection in voice.  If you have heard 'That Moon Song' and really enjoyed it, you won't regret getting the rest of the album.I agree with the other commenter above me as well.

{"text": "For the past few years, Gregory Alan Isakov has been making welcome appearances on my Pandora stations. His songs are pleasant, melodic, sad. They make for good, almost sleepy background listening. They are as pleasant as anything you will find on the market, but my criticism is that except for a couple of songs (\"Master & A Hound\", and maybe \"The Moon Song\") they aren't much more than pleasant. They don't make me want to put down what I'm doing. They don't make me want to close my eyes. They are just Pleasant.The songs' emotion feels real but restrained. In most songs, he sounds like he's singing out of the back of his throat, with his mouth barely open. I haven't seen him sing, but I suspect that he rarely opens his mouth wide enough to see his teeth. He sounds restrained, hesitant, unwilling to quite come out.With that said, Isakov has shown flashes. Master & A Hound is much better than pleasant, but still has a frustrating current of restraint. The guy is a brick wall away from being really good.\n", "val": 0.0003697579959407449}

While he has his share of public and personal heartbreak, he has had songs with amusing videos that would make you laugh, and deeper songs that stood still. That honestly is the same with Beautiful, the second single from his returning album Relapse. the song is very dark, but does state well with a hard core stand still, whether you can't get out of a jam, or dealing with heartbreak. While the song isn't as driven as was the case with his Oscar-winning Lose Yourself, Eminem holds his own fairly well. While he has been lately making a bit more news on his war of words with Mariah Carey, he still knows how to rap.

Written by Diane Warren, the song gradually builds up into a tremendous climax, and Charice's vocals not only captivate but also move listeners.True, Charice doesn't write her own songs, but that doesn't mean she can be wrongfully misjudged as a bad artist (as some people woefully attributed her).Charice is one of those very few musicians who stands apart from all teenage musicians that debuted in the mid-1990s and on, with some exceptions. Her vocal skills have elevated her to the status of the likes of Mariah, Whitney, Celine, and others.

It's ok to say that you don't like her but don't make a fool of yourself making us think she cannot sing as well as those you have mentioned, the embrassment will come back to haunt you.Each singers are individual and sings in their own octave- there's no purpose nor any sense in your comparison. It is undeniable the talent that this kid had shown and if you can't appreciate that, You're just showing your lack of character and appreciation for REAL talent that doesn't rely on showing their semi naked bodies just to gain popularity.Gone are the days of Britney and naked \"whore'smanship\"- I hope REAL talents such as Charice continue to flood the music industry.\n", "val": 0.0007884357473812997}

He outshines all others in this production for sure. I also love rock, pop, etc. so, this is one singer who will be able to throw it all up in the air and make something wonderful out of it when it comes down.This song is not something that is part of his current repertoire but it is part of his personal singing history, while on the way to becoming a world wide star after his huge breakthrough on American Idol.It's just kind of fun to be able to follow his musical history along while watching him explode onto the current music scene right now. His new CD will no doubt leave all the old songs behind while he looks ahead to chart new music courses while shaking things up because he's a forward looking artist who gets better every time he takes those creative leaps.

Blessed with not just the technical skills but also the discipline, creativity and versatility. I can't remember any. Bowie only without Adam's spectacular voice. Madonna's sorta creativity without his skill and vocal work, Freddy with an untrained smokers voice that didn't last very long who lacked vision for the showmanship. Chuck Berry's groundbreaking uniqueness. Elvis's charisma... No. Nobody had it all like Adam Lambert does. Perhaps he's lacking writing talent I don't know nor do I care...but I'm quite sure he can tweak and co-write. He \"has ideas\" as he cutely announced during AI tryouts. And proved that he sure did.After years of devotion to his craft and love, Adam Lambert proves himself superior to any other recent \"pop\" star in memory. let alone no other AI performers can hold a candle to him to the point where it was embarrassing to watch them. The Gift as seen in Celine Dion pipes, blended with the Pavarotti skill and commitment,  mixed with Freddy, Roy Orbison and Robert Plant with a touch of Grace Slick and Joni Mitchell. Pure and authentic.People who love and respect their art WORK at it. They just don't show up at a football stadium one day and ask to be on t.v.Adam Lambert's time has come. It's up to him to use it properly. He should be shooting for performances like this one, Shir Lashalom, Ring of Fire, Mad World, Feelin Good...not that dopey Gaga techno no skill required dance tunes. Very few vocalists/performers can make you cry, I hope he aspires to be more than what is being advertised...we have enough Gagas, Fergies and other mediocre overproduced so called artists as it is tyvm.I hope Adam Lambert is a new type of high profile entertainer who manages to be accepted for being true to himself, his love of role playing different genres, genuine and kind as he seems and above all the pitfalls of fame. He deserves it. Versus the stupid \"contrived\" \"rock star\" persona that were more loser than creative. (Ozzie and Mic, love ya but we want positive energy now). Thinking Bowie of today. But one who is not ashamed to admit he wants to entertain and smile and be a nice guy along with it.By the way, buy this track. Get the dvd, watch the performance. Incredible.

{"text": "Weird Al Yankovic is famous (some would say, infamous) for his amazingly spot on and incredibly hilarious parodies of popular songs.  Learning from another famous satirist, Dr. Demento, Weird Al honed his craft with such notable parodies as \"Fat\" (Michael Jackson's \"Bad\"), \"Amish Paradise\" (Coolio's \"Gangta's Paradise\") and \"Saga Begins\" (the Star Wars: Episode I spoof of Don McLean's \"American Pie\").  However, none of this could prepare his fans for the astounding quality and success of his 2006 song, \"White and Nerdy\", which is a `re-imagining' of Chamillionaire's chart-topping hit \"Ridin'\".  Calling out every single nerd stereotype in the book (including having Seth Green and Donnie Osmond in the music video), Weird Al strikes fear in the heart of every gangsta, preppie, and cool kid, who would not want to be caught anywhere near him.  This hilarious song, whose video includes a scene of Al buying a black-market copy of the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\" in a back alley (nerds understand), was well-liked by Chamillionaire, who included it on his own official web site.  Also, in what might be a first, \"White and Nerdy\" became a Top 10 song spoofing a Top 10 song (it reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100).  7 years later, it is still as much fun to watch as the first time.\n", "val": 0.015850819647312164}
{"text": "Fun fact -- this son almost never got written.  \"Weird\" Al Yankovic's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Straight-Outta-Lynwood/dp/B0029TPR1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Straight Outta Lynwood</a>&nbsp;album was originally supposed to feature a different song as its starting track, a parody of James Blunt's \"You're Beautiful\" simply titled \"You're Pitiful.\"  But when Atlantic Records threatened to sue Yankovic if he included said song on his album, he had to write this song at the last minute.  Which is probably why, in the music video for this song, you can see a nerdy version of Yankovic vandalizing Atlantic Records' Wikipedia page with a massive \"YOU SUCK\" banner.  (\"You're Pitiful\" can still be found on YouTube if one is interested in seeing what could have been...)In my opinion, while having to scrap a planned song and write another at the last minute couldn't have been fun, the album turned out all the better for it.  \"White and Nerdy\" is one of Yankovic's most memorable parodies in years, and it's become an anthem for geeks and nerds around the world.Not being a big rap fan, I haven't listened to more than snippets of the original song (\"Ridin'\" by Chamillionaire), but I have to say that Weird Al does a fantastic job on this song.  His rapping is fast-paced and intense without being rendered unintelligible by speed, and his word choices are clever, incorporating some mildly gangster-style slang along with a slew of geeky references, and still manages to rhyme throughout.  That takes some impressive skills.And being a nerd myself, I found myself nodding along to many of the nerdy references in the song, and enjoying it immensely.  Some of the references are a unfortunately a bit dated (such as \"my MySpace page is totally pimped out\"), but given that Weird Al usually tries to make his songs fit the time period they came out in, this is understandable.  And I'm sure many self-proclaimed geeks can identify with, and laugh at, some of the traits described in this song, such as being able to quote the entire \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" movie, debating whether Captain Kirk or Captain Picard was the better Star Trek character, and trouncing everyone else in a trivia contest.  Or maybe that's just me who does all these... XDA fun and clever song from the master of parody, this is easily one of Weird Al's best songs in recent times.  Even if you aren't much of a rap fan, it's guaranteed to at least make you smile, especially if you're of the geeky persuasion or know someone who is.Also, if you get a chance, look up the music video for this song.  It not only brilliantly parodies the \"Ridin'\" music video, but is stuffed full of even more geeky references.  Not to mention a hilarious cameo by Donny Osmond...\n", "val": 0.006151785142719746}

This is fine for those who are happy with compressed MP3 files with no physical media, but not for those of us who expect the higher quality of WAV files on a properly produced CD. 26 years after the introduction of CDs Disney is trying to force a move backwards in sound quality. They argue that a CD is no longer commercially viable, which is nonsense. Specialist companies such as FSM and Intrada make money out of limited editions of 3000 discs and less. Disney just can not be bothered with relatively small sales, and so treats its customers with contempt. A digital download can not be easily played in any CD player one might own. Try playing it in your car CD player for instance. It can not be bought by someone overseas in the way a CD can be imported/exported, despite the MP3 files being sold on the 'world wide web'. If you want the CD don't buy this inferior 'product' which allows Disney to fob off lower sound quality with no manufacturing costs, and wait until they realise their mistake and release a real album.\n", "val": 4.128069122089073e-05}

Absolutely brilliant, the \"Up\" movie score evokes the entire spectrum of human emotion.  One doesn't have to have seen the movie to understand how important the score likely is to each of the movie's scenes.  This is a bit of a departure for Giacchino when comparing this to his previous works; however, he progresses marvelously and deserves his grammy award.

In the featurette, director Pete Docter, producer Jonas Rivera, and of course, composer Michael Giacchino give insights into the motifs and themes used in the film, and how they were conceived and used to breathe even greater poignancy into the emotional tale told throughout the movie. We also get to see them recording bits of certain pieces, which is always a treat.What's a digital booklet, you ask? In its 25 pages, it contains mostly captures from the film, but also includes liner notes and greyscale photos of the score's development team in action. It's a beautiful little thing to behold, and for the same price as Amazon's, why not go for it?The only downside to this is that the files are, as mentioned, MP4--not MP3. This means they're compatible with fewer programs and audio players than MP3, but have slightly better quality (for those of us with audiophilic ears). Also, a note for Windows users: MP4 means you won't be able to see the tag information (artist, title, album, etc.) in Windows Explorer.However, this \"downside\" is totally invalidated if you're a Mac user who uses only iTunes to listen to music and your iPod to listen to it on the go.Whomever you buy it from, enjoy it--it's a beautiful, poignant, fun score to accompany the finest film I've ever seen.\n", "val": 0.0006882071029394865}
{"text": "When we look back on his career, 2009 could well be seen as a watershed year for Michael Giacchino in terms of public awareness and his place in the film music hierarchy. Film music fans have known about Giacchino for a long time, of course, initially through his work on the Medal of Honor video game series and the TV shows Lost and Alias. This year alone he has already scored the rebooted Star Trek movie and a new big screen version of Land of the Lost. However, it is his new status as one of Pixar's go-to guys (alongside Randy and Thomas Newman) that may cement his reputation. The Incredibles was a critical and commercial success, Ratatouille earned Giacchino his first Academy Award nomination, and now he has Up, which many writers have acclaimed as the best Pixar movie to date.The film, directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, is the wish fulfillment fantasy of an old man. Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) is a man in his 70s living in suburban America, who has become bitter and withdrawn from life following the death of his beloved wife Ellie. Faced with eviction from his house, Carl decides to fulfill his lifelong dream - and keep a promise he made to his wife before her death - by attaching thousands of helium balloons to his house, thereby turning it into an airship, so he can find his childhood hero, adventurer and explorer Charles Muntz. However, Carl is unaware that he has a companion on his journey: a ten year old Wilderness Explorer named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai), who inadvertently stowed away on Carl's porch. The film, which also features the voices of Christopher Plummer, Delroy Lindo and John Ratzenberger, has at the time of writing grossed $264 million at the US box office, making it one of the most successful films of 2009.Whereas The Incredibles was a wonderful pastiche of the John Barry spy sound and Ratatouille was drenched in stereotypical Gallic charm, Up has a less well-defined sound; in fact, it starts with an unexpectedly whimsical jazzy air in \"Up With Titles\", a cue filled with muted trumpets, pizzicato strings and swing rhythms that drip with the nostalgic sound of the roaring 20s. An equally old-fashioned waltz theme appears in the short and sweet \"We're in the Club Now\", acting as a leitmotif for Carl's wife Ellie, before moving into the longer montage sequence of \"Married Life\", which explores the up-and-down emotions of a life-long relationship, concluding with a bittersweet piano motif, echoing the sorrow Carl feels at the loss of his wife.Interestingly, these themes develop and mutate as the score progresses, forming the cornerstone of what actually becomes a richly-textured and multi-layered score. \"Carl Goes Up\" features an effortless graceful statement of Ellie's theme, underpinned by a palpable sense of freedom and adventure, while later cues such as \"The Explorer Motel\" rework the jolly main title theme into something quite unnerving and stark.The action music, of which there is quite a bit during the score's latter half, is somewhat Williams-esque in its construction, all swirling string writing, staccato percussion hits, frantic xylophone runs, and bold, punchy brasses. Cues like \"52 Chachki Pickup\", the madcap \"Three Dog Dash\" and the energetic \"Escape from Muntz Mountain\" are furiously exciting, while \"Canine Conundrum\" and \"Giving Muntz the Bird\" have a King Kong-style tribal sound, underpinned by jungle drums and a portentous attitude. \"The Small Mailman Returns\" even starts encroaching into Mikls Rzsa's spectacle music territory, reminiscent of some his more opulent marches from Sodom and Gomorrah or even Ben-Hur. Everything comes to a head in the spectacular \"Seizing the Spirit of Adventure\", which features repeat performances of the main theme, Ellie's theme, and the Rzsa-esque march theme, in all in an especially rousing fashion.Elsewhere, laid back tropical grooves highlight cues such as \"Walkin' the House\" and \"Kevin Beak'n\", reminding us that, at its heart, Up remains a film for children and the young at heart. And speaking of heart, Up reaches its emotional zenith in \"Stuff We Did\" and \"Memories Can Weigh You Down\", which begins with a tender recapitulation of Ellie's theme for piano and flute, before exploding into a stirring, heraldic version of the main theme for soaring brasses and searching, heroic strings. Everything concludes in the delightful pair, \"It's Just a House\" and the gorgeously tender \"The Ellie Badge\", before Giacchino wraps everything up into a neat little package with an 8-minute end credits suite which recapitulates all the score's main thematic content.For some reason, Disney chose not to release the Up soundtrack album in regular stores, and as a result is only available as a digital download from various online retailers such as Amazon. Quite why Disney did this is a mystery - The Incredibles and Ratatouille were both decent sellers - and it is sure to put off the purists who like to hold a shiny silver disc in their hands. Personally, I don't care whether I have a physical CD or a set of high quality MP3s, as the music all sounds the same to me anyway, but it's still necessary to mention the issue here.Up is a wonderfully entertaining and enjoyable score, a real departure from Giacchino's most recent work on Lost and Star Trek, illustrating perfectly his lighter, thematic side, and more than confirming his newly acquired status as one of Hollywood's rising music stars. It make take a few listens for the casual listener to get past the 30s jazz which opens the score, because although this is not indicative of the score's main content it still may not be to everyone's taste, but those who are willing to persevere will find plenty of delights in store.\n", "val": 0.04320823773741722}

{"text": "Written before Daughtry left for American Idol semi-superstardom, this song was also used for the actual show, and made for the best goodbye song yet. Although the song has lost a little of its luster after going through the ugly radio cycle, the song still remains as good as ever with its touching lyrics, perfect vocals, great structure, and its build-up during the course of the song. In fact, the only thing that could top this song, is its acoustic version, which I believe was distributed by Wal-Mart. It perfects the song in amazing ways, and makes the song a real stunner with new depths of emotion. That version was quickly added to my long list of best songs of all time.So overall, Daughtry's best song, and it deserves all its praise. Try to get the acoustic version if you can, but either way, its a great song that'll always be remembered for American Idol.\n", "val": 0.023362863808870316}

{"text": "I had the pleasure of Seeing Chris with Underground a few months ago and I was highly anticipating the new album. As of the time of writing, I'm not sure it's cd form is in wide release, as I can't seem to find it on cd anywhere. I eventually decided that I could not stand the wait and downloaded a digital copy. I am so glad I did, Chris Potter has yet to disappoint me and Ultrahang just rocks. It has all the great Potter characteristics: the grooves, the odd time signatures, the crazy ultra-angular melodies that somehow still sound melodic, its all here. Potter's greatest skill, however, is somehow managing to work all these sorts of elements, which in anyone else's hands would sound disparate unmelodic and making perfectly sensible music out of it all.If you have heard an a Chris Potter Underground album before, you'll know what to expect. This album has everything 'Underground' and 'Follow the Red Line' had. We see the same sorts of interplay, the same sorts of grand dynamic movement and same crazy grooves as before. Ultrahang has a nice selection of tunes from wild funk workout 'Rumples' to the Bob Dylan tune 'it aint me babe' reworked as a signature Chris Potter Ballad. Chris excels on both saxophone and bass clarinet as he always has. He is backed by what has to be the one of the tightest rhythm sections in history. Drummer Nate Smith has to be commended for keeping the tightest grooves in the strangest time signatures. The music never sounds forced, it is always natural, as if you could get up and dance to it (though I don't know how you would). It is hard to think of a fitting comparison to make to describe this band; I cant think of any other band that really has the same sort of style.Ultimately, Underground has put out another solid release. While, I may think that 'Follow the Red Line: Live at the Village Vanguard' may be a better album, not by much. This is still a spectacular album that should delight fans and newcomers alike.\n", "val": 0.010945803485810757}
{"text": "Man I bought Ultrahang the first week that it came out after totally being blown away by this band's live album Follow The Red Line which was released two years ago.  Chris Potter and band which is Adam Rogers-Guitar, Craig Taborn-Fender Rhodes and Nate Smith on drums haven't lost anything on this newest offering.  I'd say if anything they've pushed the envelope even further than before.  I like how the composing credit gets shared with Adam Rogers contributing the awesome Rumples track 3.  They also threw in a cover of Bob Dylan's It Ain't Me Babe which gets a slick ballad treatment with the melody taken on the beautiful bass clarinet and then switching to tenor to take the song out.  My personal favorite and in my opinion a watershed composition for this band & Chris Potter is track #2 Facing East.  This song is a epic mind blowing piece of music which just has to be heard to be appreciated, it has the entire spectrum of emotion bundled into its almost ten minutes. The opener Ultrahang is a funky great start and from there it just gets better.  Let me also point out the masterful drumming of Nate Smith and the overall groove interplay of the band as a whole, its like at times everyone is a drum with the melodies flying around each member with reckless abandon, well their artistry is hardly reckless or uninspired.  I believe these guys to be some of the most original and creative players on the world jazz scene today period! Share in this great art.\n", "val": 0.007019521668553352}

{"text": "I'm one half of 400 Lonely Things, and I compiled this album, so it's safe to say that I'm partial to this.  That being said, I think this album is more than a label sampler; it's a compilation that plays like an album and has a certain flow and cohesion that balances its unpredictability and strangeness.  Some of the songs are as bizarre and adventurous as the provocative, pulpy artwork (check out the additional images) - while others are quiet and organic and content to lurk in the background.  Some tracks are creepy and soundtracky in their seriousness, and others are funny, catchy, and aggressive.  But all are bewildering, both in the sense of their uniqueness and in their obscurity.  Usually, saying that something is new and different is rightfully met with skepticism, cynicism or disappointment - but in the case of Smatterings it can be said with a straight face.  There's bound to be something you've never heard of here that you like, and plenty to baffle the uninitiated.  Most of these artists have several albums available right here at Amazon, and they could all use your support.

{"text": "Pimalia succeeds with this eclectic first sampler from its roster of artists.  I've listened to this comp multiple times since its release and have neither skipped any of the tracks nor shut it off.  I can't believe that Amazon is offering something this cool/esoteric as a free download (although hard copies have always been available via snail mail).Stylistically, Smatterings Vol I is all over the map but retains a certain continuity lacking in most label compilations.  The Robot Buckwheats and Moolah Temple $tringband tunes are my favorite but the Penetralia and Diarmuid MacDiarmada cuts have received heavy rotation at home and in the car.I am already a huge fan of 400 Lonley Things, Hawaiian Garbage, Robot Buckwheats, Moolah Temple $tringband, and Forms Of Things Unknown (I believe all available from Amazon).  Do yourself a favor and download Pimlia's Smatterings Vol I (for free) and check out their truly eclectic roster of artists.  It's the bomb, baby, bomb.

{"text": "About time Alan Silvestri's complete score for 'Predator' was released on CD. It's a shame that it was limited to only 3000 copies as this is one of Silvestri's best film scores. After looking on countless sites I finally managed to score one. The product does not disappoint.Silvestri's score has more than a few motifs/themes throughout; most evident are Major Anderson's theme (most obvious at the beginning)- a belligerent piano motif - and the Predator's - a sinister trombone cue. Spectacular additional tracks included 'Girl's Escape/Blain's Death', featuring rapid trombone arpeggios as Blain is struck by the Predator's laser & keels over dead. My personal favorite track was 'Predator's Death', which featured a cue previously released as 'The Trap', detailing Major Anderson's desperate attempt to lure the Predator into his carefully laid trap. An awesome action score, not to be missed!\n", "val": 0.01753658428788185}
{"text": "One of the most iconic action/horror scores of all time is Alan Silvestri's Predator. As a late 80's score it was a breath of fresh air amongst the heavily synthesized action scores that had been coming out. However Predator was unique in that Silvestri still blended signature synthesized sounds amongst the orchestra. The synths didn't replace the orchestra they became the instrument that would play that ever so famous theme.The score is so well crafted and executed that you can actually map the editing of the film in your head just by listening to it. It fits the film like a glove, but is so firmly grounded that it stands on its own. Silvestri utilizes strings heavily in the score. At times they play the role of \"horror strings\" to create that familiar suspense and at other times they oscillate pulsing melodies to get the adrenaline pumping. Accompanying brass motifs enforce the intensity of the score and give you a sense of danger. Then you have that piano. That piano that makes the score even more unique. Honestly, how often do you hear piano in an action score? He uses low end notes to add a certain \"ting\" almost in a percussive manner to break up the continuous nature of the strings. All the while Silvestri injects a sense of curiosity and intrigue into the score to give you the feeling that things aren't normal. It's such a brilliantly layered score that you don't see too often anymore.One other aspect of the soundscape here is the slight militarization of the music that embodies our main character. The military aspect of the score is also the only source of tragedy in the music as head in the track \"He's My Friend\". For the rest of the music when Silvestri uses that militarized percussion it reminds us that our hero is trained and in command, and that he will not back down.This score has been long out of print and Intrada has released a wonderful remastered version here. Even though this 3,000 unit edition is already sold out (in a matter of hours actually) it was nice to have it reintroduced into the market. Intrada remastered the score from two-track digital stereo session master elements that were recently discovered. So while there is still a slight hiss to this master it is a huge improvement. This is a must own for any film fans out there. It embodies a generation of action music and still stands the test of time as one of the best action scores ever composed.\n", "val": 0.019983816891908646}

Finally, it's here. Now there have been a few earlier releases that somehow slipped by me. When I found this one, I wasn't going to let it go.We're presented with 20 tracks that pretty much covers nearly all of the cues from the film. What I really like is they're presented in the order Silvestri originally recorded them. A few cues will be out of place when compared to the finished film, but it does not take away from the enjoyment of having one of the greatest film scores.I am curious, though as to why the Fox Fanfare is the one used at the beginning of \"Alien 3?\" Why not used the version from, you know \"Predator?\" Anyway, that's neither here nor there.

{"text": "If there is a fitting single to start off the Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen soundtrack, it is this one. As mentioned on their website, this song actually came from a batch of songs they came up with for the whole cast of characters from the movie. For example, they would have a song with a working title named Optimus Prime and another named Megatron, which eventually became New Divide.So they knocked around a few of the songs and found this one to be the most fitting of all. Rightly so, New Divide talks about a conflict, about a separation within Megatron's psyche in both metaphorical and figurative ways.  The song symbolizes a union between the Fallen and Megatron, best exemplified by the line \"Like a startling sign that fate has finally found me. Your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserved.\" This shows the level of storytelling the song has and is an example of Linkin Park's sublime songwriting.Their execution of the song was also just as impressive. From the beginning rift to the haunting first few lines to the change in tempo and intensity for the chorus and then to the energized techno interlude. The whole song is well arranged and the flow of it fits the emotional tension and mood to a T. Underneath it all, Ray Bourdon's drums are what provide the tribal feel and also the tempo for the track. And as usual, the rest of the band (Delson's guitar, Hahn's beats, Shinoda's keys) was just as fitting.But the star of the song is Chester's vocals. Not only do you believe the actual words he sings, which sells the story, but it also provides the main strength and power of the song itself. People who have heard him on his Dead by Sunrise record would know about the intensity Chester provides with his singing and how it drives every one of his songs forward. Here, in New Divide, you get exactly the same energy. Just compare the acapella version of this song to the instrumental track (both included here) and you can tell that the vocals are actually more powerful than the instrumentals, which is amazing.On a whole, New Divide delivers what it promises; a good morsel of music greatness. Listen to it in the car or on your Ipod, this single will slowly grow on you. Hail, Megatron!\n", "val": 0.024315373972058296}

It still has the revolutionary electronic sound no other band comes close to matching.People keep complaining about the new Linkin Park songs sounding like pop and they should play on the radio next to the Jonas Brothers and Katy Perry.  This has to be the biggest insult the band could receive.  They do get radio time, but not because teenie-boppers and soccer moms call in and request it, it's because their sound is so clean and it absorbs the listener and any good DJ would/should mix in a little GOOD music with all the crap that gets played.Here's a test for you non-believers.  Take any Linkin Park song (Hybrid Theory album and beyond) and crank the volume.  In my opinion they are the only band who cannot get too loud.  They pay so much attention to detail in their beats and vocal levels that it never gets annoying and it never gets old.

Adam said that the song was difficult to sing live and that it had great lyrics.  He said that he had wished that he and Kris had more time to rehearse it; but he wanted everyone to hear the studio version of the song.  I love this studio version!  Some say that this song does not suit Adam.  But this song (with its lyrics) actually does somewhat fit Adam's journey.  In an interview, Adam had said that when he was in the cast of \"Wicked\" he grown dissatisfied with where he was at in his  career and had wondered if this was all there was.  The feelings and sentiment are actually reflected in this song.  Listen to the lyrics again (Adam is always into the lyrics).

I always thought that show was so high-school musical but seeing that quality/level of talent was so shocking and like Kara said-it was all crazy and confusing too! I had the same feeling when I first saw David Bowie.I have downloaded all of his songs and since they were done in a studio-it's professional quality. My husband (a musician) who would have had to be tied-up, gagged and forced at gunpoint to listen to this type of music (or watch AI) is blown away with Adam's rendition of \"One\" and has said Adam's version it's better than Bono's . There is something for everyone in the Lambert line-up.Kara's song -\"No Boundaries\" is a load of you-know-what BUT Adam Lambert gives the song credibility. It's doubtful he would have ever chosen a song like that but he is so professional that he sings it like he loves it and Kara owes him a huge thank-you.

{"text": "The song is good, but the voice is spectacular. Adam Lambert exploded onto the pop music scene as a charismatic powerhouse contestant on American Idol. He is credited by many as breathing new life into what had become a dull talent show and making it a solid and exciting entertainment competition in Season 8. The show's ratings soared as word spread about this young man with the (capital I) IT factor that rivals the likes of Elvis, Madonna, and Michael Jackson. He can sing himself into your heart with his classically trained velvet voice when doing a ballad or enliven your libido with his sexy edgy glam rock style. And he can sing just about anything in between just as well. His range is astounding. He is unique in the pop music world today.This particular song, co-written by a AI judge Kara DioGuardi and a required recording for Adam for the show, may not be the best choice for his incredible talent to display itself, but still, it grew on me and is a favorite now. It's lyrics, while a bit over the top, are inspiring and uplifting for our troubled times, and all the more when Adam Lambert sings them and gives them a gentle power.It is by far the superior version of No Boundaries.Adam is recording his first album over the summer of 2009 and it should hit the stores sometime after that. My advice is to watch for it. After experiencing what this gifted gorgeous guy gave us in his American Idol performances, I have high hopes his album will be breathtaking.BTW, that pic used for the cover art does such little justice to Adam's amazing attractiveness. Don't know why it was chosen. But he is so much better looking than that! Not that it matters to the quality of your listening experience. But it bugs me just the same.

That being said, Kris has managed to personalize this song.  He has really made it his own.  The emotion that he puts into the song pretty much makes up for the awful lyrics.  Kris' emphais on the feeling of the song and on certain words makes all of the difference.This is still not the best song in the world, but Allen's talent for getting to the heart of a song, even one as cheesy as this one, can't be ignored.  Somehow, he just makes this song work, because he has personalized it, and actually makes it seem like the song is about him.\n", "val": 0.0040066177025437355}

If you are looking for a unique Theological/musical experience, then you'll appreciate Theophanies.  Listen to this album straight through in its entirity and you will get a doctrinal overview of God manifesting Himself to man at various times, a topic that I personally have never heard preached from the pulpit.  Over the years I have learned so much from Hazakim, and their music is sure to point believers toward the Word, provoking them to search the scriptures.  Besides being doctrinally on point, musically Hazakim is taking hip hop to another level.  Complete with orchestration, live instrumentation and unique sample choices, this album is totally original.  And on top of all of this, Mike and Tony are true lyricists, able to switch styles and rip the mic.  Notable guests appearances by Shai Linne, Stephen the Levite, Muze One, and lesser known artists such as Mahlodi and Dwayne O'Dell.

But Hazakim treads on one of the grandest mysteries of the text of scripture and flows the Judeo in Judeo Christian roots of the Faith! With excerpts of Dr. Michael Brown inundating the album we are headed for Judaism at its core and they don't let it stop the flow but give us a new sound with hallel's springing forth and yes even including a bit of Raggae sounds to the Isaiah 6 inundation in the song KADOSH! Hazakim's Theophanies is no less groundbreaking work in the same powerful exposition Timothy Brindle's \"The Great Awakening\" was and continues to be!

With a haunting guitar intro and the addition of some tasteful percussion, I think this is probably the best song on the EP.  Her vocal performance is about as 'on' as it gets too.

One statement made was that album - while I loved it - would probably not be my recommendation to anyone wanting to become acquainted with Billie's work. This album, on the other hand, is one I would recommend without hesitation or qualification.What makes this one special is many of her early John Hammond produced and Teddy Wilson led sessions are on it. And every track contains performances that make it easy to understand why Billie was perhaps the most important jazz vocalist in history. Surely, if I were hand-picking the tracks, I would have also used most ones on this album. There are a few that are on the other album I cited; specifically, the 1957 performance of Fine and Mellow, but that is my personal preference.Even if you are a Billie fan with these songs scattered across a multitude of albums, this one is worth it because most of the gems are in one place.

This was the MP3 \"Deal of the Day\" on September 4, 2009 at a price of $2.99. I mention that because Amazon has now published this \"review\" on other product pages as well.The special price of $2.99 may have been very good, but one thing is certain: despite its name, this collection is far from \"complete\". I have listened to quite a bit of Billie Holiday, but I don't own any of her music currently. This collection contains a lot of great music, but even at a glance I noticed it doesn't include some of my favorite tracks, like \"Stormy Weather,\" \"Ain't Misbehaving,\" or \"Embraceable You.\"So what's going on with this collection? It's hard to say precisely. There are now two \"Complete Billie Holiday\" MP3 collections, one with 35 tracks and another with 65 tracks:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Complete-Billie-Holiday/dp/B0028FJ89E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Complete Billie Holiday</a>. Both sets were priced at $7.99 as of September 8, 2009, after the special $2.99 price expired on the 35-track set.Both these MP3 collections originally showed pictures and displayed reviews from the following 10-CD set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Complete-Billie-Holiday-On-Verve-1945-1959/dp/B0000046P3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Complete Billie Holiday On Verve, 1945-1959</a>. (Update: Amazon removed the Verve set's pictures and reviews from the MP3 pages during the week of September 13, 2009.) The Verve set also has its own, much more extensive MP3 version, priced at over $90:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Complete-Billie-Holiday-On-Verve-1945-1959/dp/B000VHIT0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Complete Billie Holiday On Verve, 1945-1959</a>.But wait, there's more. There is another 10-CD set of her recordings on the Columbia label:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lady-Day-The-Complete-Billie-Holiday-on-Columbia-1933-1944/dp/B00005Q47M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lady Day: The Complete Billie Holiday on Columbia (1933-1944)</a>.Billie Holiday's music is great, no matter what collection you buy. However, her voice was stronger during her early years with Columbia than it was later with Verve, when she was more likely to have her performances affected by the use of drugs and alcohol.This is not really a product review -- thus the neutral three-star rating. I have not bought this set, and I'm not sure I will since it doesn't include some of the tunes I would most want to hear.However, I thought people should be aware that contrary to its advertising, this set is not \"complete\" -- or even anything vaguely resembling complete. It could still be a good deal for people who are aware of what they are buying and are OK with that. The 35-track set does not seem to be the smart choice, however, since you can get all of tracks plus 30 more for the same price.\n", "val": 4.390901085571386e-05}

{"text": "The naked beauty of Lady Day cannot be denied . The raw power of her voice cannot be questioned the artistry of her pain has eldued immitators and moved audiences to tears . Quite simply a Jazz Genius and revolutionary as she was a female Jazz Genius .The personal suffering and misery that crowned the beauty of this majestic voice is relentlessly present in everything she sung. A woman who was forced to use the service elevator when she would perform to white audiences a woman who endured the monstrosity of rape and prostitution . Some of the reviewers on here complain there's not enough\"grit\" in her performances I disagree the crushing melancholy of her battle for survial haunts every lyric of every song . You can feel it every last tear even songs that aren't laced with saddness have a haunting poignancy . This collection will not disappoint and is an ageless reminder of one of the greatest Jazz Singers who ever lived . Treasure it . I do.\n", "val": 0.01521183829754591}

{"text": "The are few musicians that I would call astonishing. New Orleans pianist Henry Butler qualifies to my ears. I remember the first recording of his that I listened to, the marvelous \"For All Seasons\" on Atlantic. Mostly backed by a trio that included David Holland on bass and Herman Jackson on drums (Steve Turre plays trombone on one track), the album generally is a strong hard bop piano set, but the highpoint is his solo rendition of W.C. Handy's \"St. Louis Blues,\" on which his musical explorations bring a truly fresh take on this classic song. After this disc, his recordings have become less jazz-oriented and more blues-r'n'b focused.His newest recording is \"PianoNOLA\" on Basin Street Records. Co-produced by George Winston, who produced Butler's \"Orleans Inspiration\", this disc is a collection of live solo performances that include several instrumentals as well his renditions of several blues and R&B classics. The strength of this recording is his piano playing especially on the marvelous renditions of `Basin Street Blues,', his own tour de force `Orleans Inspiration,' and the late Alvin Batiste's \"North American Idiosyncrasies.' As a vocalist, Butler sometimes come off as a bit melodramatic to these ears (explaining the four stars as opposed to four and half or five), but even on such a well-known number as Professor Longhair's `Tipitina,' he radically reworks it in his stunning original solo and the piano and a wordless vocal part lifts up his rendition of the Ernie K-Doe classic, `Mother-in-Law.' While the overwrought vocal on `Sitting on the Dock of the Bay,' is perhaps the low point, the rollicking `Let It Roll,' (originally on the marvelous \"VU-DU-Menz\" album with Corey Harris) picks things up. If this reviewer finds this uneven, there is no question that there are many inspired moments throughout this disc. Maybe his wonderful \"Orleans Inspiration,\" will be made readily available again.\n", "val": 0.01370408944785595}

I bought \"The Harvest\" off of ITUNES a few days before the June 6th release party and in less than a weeks time I have memorized almost every line/note to every song again! This CD is a huge step forward and you can hear how the band has grown from a young up and coming reggae act into a full experienced and confident act. The lyrics are just as deep as on the prior release. \"Foolishness a father has taught to the son...\" Steve chants on \"Vampire\" which also features the bass player \"Whiteboy\" John Wegener..who chants down babylon pretty decently. He also appears on the track \"Come Around\" but this time he is singing! And he does it well! A lot of the songs have an obvious latin/reggae/rock fusion and it still sounds like true reggae! Sonny Sanvodal of P.O.D. makes a guest appearence on \"Warning\" which is one of my favorite songs on the disc [although it is for Steve's chants and not Sonny's]. \"The Garden\" kicks the whole disc off with a fun loving ganja jam that actually has some intelligent views...flipping the finger pointed at Rasta and pointing it back on the media's propoganda and the \"government lies\"...Every song is good so if you even have a thought of picking this album up...do yourself a favor and get it!

{"text": "I recently discovered Ryan Farish from listening to the Sky. FM/New Age channel on my Squeezebox Boom. I was motivated to chase down the CD that the track was from: \"Everlasting.\" I bought the CD thru Amazon and loved so much of it that I went to his website. From there I discovered the haunting \"Pacific Wind\" and the YouTube video it's used on, \"Remember Me.\" I am new to this party, but bought all the CD's that I could -- most recently, the OUTSTANDING \"Bloom.\"This album, \"From The Sky,\" appears to me to be the turning point in his development of the \"Farish Sound.\"  I'm old enough (57) to have grown up in the days of spectacular \"hi-fi\", the breakaway from the console Magnavoxes that dominated home consumer audio at the time. Mantovani and his special \"sound\" was all the rage. (See \"Mantovani-A Lifetime in Music\" by Colin MacKenzie, especially p. 136: \"Mantovani developed the knack of presenting his music in a way that left the careful listener with a sense of...having 'experienced' the piece instead of having just 'heard the song.' \")Although a different time, different century, the music of Ryan Farish hearkens back (for me) to that kind of major departure from the status quo. As a completely self-contained \"musician\" (writer/arranger/producer/concert performer--and now distributor of beautiful tunes) Farish goes beyond the magnificent sonic treatment of a modern Mantovani. (I'll probably get pies in the face for daring to compare the different genres.) For me, this music is so gorgeous that it deserves the highest praise I can give it!!!\n", "val": 0.014181547798216343}

I have been an avid listener since, listening to music via social networks such as Twitter, Grooveshark, and Imeem.I listen to Ryan's music when I'm blogging, typing, or working on my sculpture.

{"text": "This is Ryan Farish's follow up to his \"Beautiful\" CD.Invigorating and inspiring, the songs on this CD are pensive, meditative and reflective. If, like me, you loved \"Beautiful's\" infectious good cheer and impossible to resist hooks, you'll not be disappointed with From the Sky.Farish branches out into Deep Forest-ish territory with third world chant/chorale samples on the opening \"The Promise\" (set off against his usual piano, snare/high-hat beats, and flowing keyboards).He incorporates these same elements in a few other spots on the album (e.g. the celebratory \"Joy\").\"Living Water\" opens with breathy wood flute samples and also features the first noticeable appearance of acoustic guitar, deep in the mix but easily heard on headphones, and the beats have a more sensuous if not primal urgency, counterpointed by almost blues-jazz piano.Some songs hone closer to the sound Farish perfected on Beautiful, such as \"Home Again\" and \"Legacy\", which is a trippy beat-laden \"happy to be alive\" kind of tune featuring excellent use of female chorals with piano, beats and lush synths, as well as some funky bass rhythms.\"Miles Away\" is a slower tempo piece that would be ideal accompaniment for a brisk walk along a country lane.The title track is a slow tempo song but dramatic affair which again uses orchestral strings to greater effect than simply applying a layer of wash of violins.\"Rejoice\", the album closer, starts off sounding like Ray Lynch before veering over into Deep Forest tribal chants set against a percolating backbeat, lilting lively flute samples, and eventually Enigma-esque rhythms, all the while retaining the particular plucked string synth sound.My favorite song from this CD would have to be the beautiful \"Pacific Wind\", which features stunning female vocals with a nice piano piece to back it up.In conclusion, \"From The Sky\" amply displays Ryan's strong blend of reverbed piano, bubbly beats, expert layering of assorted keyboards and chill-out/electronica effects, as well as production that is flawless in every respect. I highly recommend this CD to all music lovers, trust me, you won't be disappointed with this CD, I know I wasn't........\n", "val": 0.017266539856791496}

{"text": "You may have heard snippets of Ryan Farish's music if you have ever watched The Weather Channel. His music has been featured on the Weather on the 8's as well as Storm Stories. But his credits are not limited to TV snippets; his music also graces a documentary, and has found its way into the NPR radio stations and featured on CBN's 700 Club.It was, however, mp3.com that made this artist. He originally released his music on mp3.com, rapidly becoming one of the most downloaded artists on the site. His New Age music is inspiring, providing compositions that explore his melodies fully with a very upbeat and positive inclination.This CD contains twelve tracks, with no times listed, and it runs about an hour. This is very professionally produced, with string arrangements by John Majkut.Some highlights include \"The Promise\" which is reminiscent of Deep Forest, with drums, lovely piano composition, tribal voices and choir. This piece has a lovely upbeat rhythm and a delightful piano melody. A very good opening introduction to this CD.Also \"Home Again\" which has a stand out beat, Again, bright, melodic and almost inspirational. \"Walk With You\" takes an almost Eastern turn, adding flute to accompany the piano with the return of the choir and tribal beat. A nice blending of rhythms and style.It's easy to see why this CD is #3 on New Age Billboard Chart. The music is always upbeat, even when it takes a time out to contemplate. It is inspirational in feel, and the compositions are worth taking the time to appreciate. As in all New Age music, this CD can be a focal point, or a soundscape for your personal space. A must have for your New Age collection. maf\n", "val": 0.03422201797366142}
{"text": "Since his last release, Farish changed residences from the East to the West.  The Norfolk, Virginia native moved to Los Angeles late last year, a big change of scenery him and his wife. Farish explained to his fans that he wanted to be on the west coast to pursue a career as a successful music composer and become involved in movie projects. Farish's use of vocal arrangements on the various tracks such as \"The Promise\" is a refreshing chance of pace from his previous releases. It shows his diverse musical talents. He also uses South African vocal arrangements in the track, \"Rejoice!\" Listening to this CD gives me extreme pride and joy. Its soothing melodies are uplifting and inspirational.  Much like last year's Top 5 Smooth Jazz and More selection \"Beautiful\", \"From the Sky\" will be a CD at the top of this year's \"best of\" list as well.

I have both these CDs at work, and I play them so that I can get some work done...they are ideal for that!  The music is well, relaxing, but not sleep-inducing.

{"text": "Following the smash success of his first commercial release, \"Beautiful,\" Ryan Farish follows up with \"From The Sky\" - one of the best albums to be released this year.  Just as with \"Beautiful,\" fans will find themselves spirited away to a world of audio delights certain to erase stress and move the soul.The cardboard case itself is a work of art, a three-pronged fold-out evoking the image of an angel fluttering across a mountain meadow on a crisp and cool autumn morn. Both the back cover and the initial inside panel present fans with photos of the artist (a very attractive guy!) as he walks along an enticing ocean shoreline.  The disc itself is decorated with alluring ivory and copper tones that create a feeling of high sophistication and majesty symbolic of the musical tracks held within.  Sporting such high quality disc casing along with its quality tracks, \"From The Sky\" is an absolute bargain at listed retail prices.Although this CD plays like a \"Best of Ryan Farish\" compilation, a few tracks stand out from the rest and have earned the status of my personal favorites.  \"The Promise\" (Track 1) sets an African theme for the album from the get-go with voiceovers that remind one of Hans Zimmer's work on the score for The Lion King, while simultaneously retaining Ryan's own unique flavor.  In addition, the piano melodies bear the fingerprint of Ryan's earlier work \"Beautiful\".  So if you like that CD, you'll love \"From The Sky\"...  \"Joy\" (Track 3) conveys an abundant sense of happiness and an upbeat tempo indicative of the song's title.  The track captures the essence of the album which seems to be a celebration of life - a fresh break from the dour and negative themes often perpetuated by the pop music of our era...  \"Rejoice!\" (Track 12) continues the theme of uplifting melodies with sonic waves that resemble raindrops of sound emanating through the stillness of an unblemished puddle.  The use of voiceovers continues the theme of an ancient African celebration and transports the listener to an entirely new dimension...  And these are just three examples of the wonders found within \"From The Sky\"!  I challenge listeners to uncover a single track that fails to exude the same standards of excellence...If you enjoy the New Age and Electronic genres, then you will fall in love with \"From The Sky\" by Ryan Farish.  It easily summons its listener to a faraway magical retreat where the hustle and bustle of everyday life disappears in favor of an unending blitzkrieg of sensual and mood-relaxing delights...Britt Gillette\n", "val": 0.014126131311058998}

{"text": "There are a lot of famous singers, I won't mention names, who are trying to prove to the world that they could sing standards.  They believe that they could have still made it big if they had been around in the 30s & 40s and had to compete with Crosby, Sinatra, Como, and Martin. (Dean or Tony, take your pick)  And they're all wet.  They could never have made it in that realm, not for lack of talent, but because they just don't get what that style of music is all about.  Deana Martin gets it, and proves she gets it with VOLARE.  It's not just notes and lyrics, it's feelings and emotions.  It's a varied selection of songs, shaded in different styles, but all with their roots in romance.  Her rendition of \"Return To Me\" is not just sung, it's performed. The urgency in her voice tells the whole back-story and makes the song a short play.  And most importantly, it's not acted, it's sincere.  She Gets It.

The beginning is catchy and very much what I like to listen to, but then it got to the middle part, which seems a bit like a cross between rapping and just talking.

So now, I can listen to the whole song and happily whistle the 'Tonight's gonna be a good night' part on my walk into work, without being grumpy about the middle part, which I *still* dislike.\n", "val": 0.005331207066774368}

At the very BEST, this song serves as background music in a fast food restaurant, or an exercise facility that has the most popular radio station on that is, most likely, set to repeat its playlist ever 3 hours.This song.. it's just not anything. The only stellar song by The Black Eyed Peas, in my opinion, is \"Where is the Love?\" and that was when they were just emerging. If this is what pop music has come to, I'm sticking with the 70s, 80s, and 90s, and tuning out my share of 'today'.\n", "val": 0.00019650373724289238}

I'm tired of every song on the radio just being about sex and heartbreak. This is just a fun song that you can jam out to with your friends.

For The Black Eyed Peas latest single, I've Gotta Feeling, the second single from their latest album The E.N.D., it simply shows the group trying to simply try for a much more mature, adult contemporary mix sound to their songs. But sadly, it just isn't a very exciting song, it just doesn't really score at all. I honestly think that Will. I.Am, and company really need to re-evaluate their songs and sounds, and then come back with something that should be more funky and driven, becuase they just don't have the feeling.Song: D\n", "val": 2.0126797608099878e-05}

It took 12 people to write lyrics like:\"I've gotta feelingthat tonight's gonna be a good nightthat tonight's gonna be a good nightthat tonight's gonna be a good, good night\"Which is repeated for roughly 90 seconds before the song even starts. How about:\"Tonight's the night, let's live it upI got my money, let's spend it up\" (yeah, rhyming \"Up\" and \"up\")\"Monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday, friday, saturday, saturday to sunday,Get get get get get with us, you know what we say-say, party every daypppparty every day\" (We know what the days of the week are. Party every day???)Or what about the fact that \"That tonight's gonna be a good night\" is repeated 18 times, \"Do it\" is repeated 31 times, or the random use of \"Mazel tov\" or \"L'chiam\" (Is this that movie \"When The Wind Blows\" on acid? \"When the BEP Blows\"?)???Yeah the beat is pretty catchy, you gotta admit. Though it's catchy the first time you hear it, and then the next 500 times you hear it makes you wanna find the nearest object that can be used as a weapon, and find some wayto use it as means of killing yourself. I'd say \"Avoid\" but since this drivel is played roughly every 10 minutes, it's really unavoidable.Poor little state of music.\n", "val": 4.741058364743367e-05}

It was produced by David Guetta.A lot of people complain over the repetition, the lack of meaning, structure or even originality in the lyrics. The song is in fact extremely repetitive. When it first aired on the radio, I kept singing \"I gotta a feeling, that tonight's gonna be a good nignt\" over and over again.  A friend finally asked whether I knew the rest of the lyrics.  I didn't, but it was because there isn't much more to the song. They keep repeating the same lyrics for 4 stanzas straight. Then there are about 4 or so stanza's of different lyrics (\"let's live it up\" and so on).Regardless, I find that the song serves its purpose. It is a pop song aimed at relaxing you and getting you ready to party. It has a catchy tune and lyrics and you will find yourself singing it every time it comes on the radio. You will also find yourself dancing to it, jumping up and down, and singing it out loud.It is an extremely likable and infectious song.

Boom Boom Pow, the latest single from The Black Eyed Peas brings in a more techno rhythm to the funky sounds. While the song had a nice beat, it just sadly wasn't as driven as their songs from a few earlier like Don't Phunk With My Heart or My Humps showed for fans.

{"text": "Boom-Boom-Pow is the kind of unique dance music that comes along every so often.  It has an infectious beat, one that makes you want to get up and start bopping away; throwing your hands and fists into the air to accentuate every Boom Boom Pow sung by the Black Eyed Peas.  The song is all about ENERGY, Dance Energy, getting onto the dance floor and letting yourself get into the music, letting yourself get lost in the music.  With every beat of the song, your heart, your entire body beats to the beat.As such, this song, Boom Boom Pow clearly delivers.The downside:  the lyrics do contain a few cuss words.  This song is not differentiated into a Radio Edit and an Album Version.  You only get one version from Amazon; the explicit version.  So Parents, if you're buying this for your young children thinking that you're going to get the Radio Edit version, think again.  You're going to get the Explicit Version, with every profanity clearly heard over the heavy beat of the music.  What kind of profanities?  Just the word we consider to be the profane slang word for excrement, poop, feces, crap, dirt, bowel movement, BM, bum nuggets, caca, crapola, dump, scat, and turd.

The voice modulator is annoying and the song is weak overall. I really miss the pre-Fergie days when the Black Eyed Peas were more about pure rhythm and rhyme instead of driving dance beats and (to be honest) crappy music. Fergie is talented, but her addition completely changed the dynamic of the group and I keep hoping with each new album release that they will go back to their roots for at least a track or two.But back to the main issue here.

Did it really do that?  I certainly couldn't say that 40\" of this music was equivalent to 4 hours of sleep, but it was relaxing (I usually fell asleep before it was finished), and it may have helped some - it's hard to say how effective this was (or whether it was effective at all), because I was most tempted to use this when I was most sleep deprived, which isn't the time when my objective judgment is functioning at its finest.

All in all, it's a fair collection on MP3, but the CD lacked the 30 seconds of care it would have taken for a human editor to correct a few issues.\n", "val": 3.780514089157805e-05}

Fred and Ginger made 10 films together, you get 20 tracks of the most popular songs like, Puttin On the Ritz, Night and Day, Cheek To Cheek. These and other songs they sang were specially written for them by famous song writers like George Gershwin and Cole Porter. The second track of the cd \"We're in the Money\" is sung by Ginger from the film Gold Diggers of 1933, this is a rareity and a fabulous song.

Being turned on by the beautiful album cover, I gave it a try and WOW! This is an absolutely gorgeous and elegant debut release. The CD is described as a mix of Yanni, Tangerine Dream, and Robert Miles. Overall, I describe this as closer to Robert Miles as opposed to the other two with the exception of \"Letting Go\" which has a very Yanni-esque feel but having a far more sophisticated and beauty that Yanni can only dream of. \"Secret Garden\" is arguably my favorite song on this release having a beautiful electronic beat and fast rhythm.

The music is inspired, the melodies transcending, and the emotion - deep and meaningful. As far as \"copying Yanni\" goes, well - I don't agree, in fact, Yanni is far more generic and less inspired. The sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact NOT the same nor, are they Yanni's creation. I write this review to commend mr farish on his work, and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and couldn't resist his own urge to see his \"critique\" in print. Ryans music is distinctly his own, no question - and any similarities are tonal, and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of. As far as I'm concerned, you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve's and websites for music to criticize - and well, make themselves feel a little better.

I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!!  But not only that, Farish also inserted the same clip of children laughing that Amethystium uses in their song \"Avalon\" from their \"Odonata\" album.  What's up with that?  Unless there's good explanation for this copying, the song \"Carried by the Wind\" has ruined Ryan Farish for me.\n", "val": 4.669122427003458e-05}
{"text": "One of my favorite independent artists has a new CD out. Ryan Farish was in high demand when the old MP3.com website was alive, receiving more downloads than any other independent artist. The Norfolk, Virginia area resident's music is a mix of New Age and Acid Jazz, blended together into a great source of listening pleasure. If you've never heard of Ryan Farish, you might want to check out the Weather Channel during the local forecasts as they give his music plenty of airplay. His new CD, \"Beautiful\" is bursting at the seams with life. It contains several tracks from previous CD releases. \"Secret Garden\" and \"Letting Go\" are two songs that get a second listen as well as new recordings such as \"Sunshine in the Rain\" and \"Adoration\".

{"text": "Ryan Farish in his first commercial release \"Beautiful\" creates a portfolio of sound and emotion a fan of the Electronic & New Age genre will want to make a pillar of his personal collection for years to come.  Unlike many first albums, \"Beautiful\" should be more aptly labeled a \"greatest hits\" release because every track from one to fourteen is a masterpiece of sound and production.The CD case itself is a work of art, sporting a clean, high-quality cardboard fold-out instead of the traditional (and cheap) Jewel-case plastic with paper insert.  With the vision of a beautiful seashore at dusk dominating its cover, both inside and out, the CD itself blends into the background, creating a level of quality typically seen in high-dollar commercial releases.  With above average quality CD packaging, \"Beautiful\" is a bargain at the listing price.  I highly recommend it for music collectors who cherish the visual beauty of their discs.Although every track is amazing, I have a few personal favorites.  \"Chasing The Sun\" (Track 3) is a tune I can't get out of my head.  A modern electronic melody is coupled with a creative piano interlude that is quite uplifting.  \"Full Sail\" (Track 8) could easily have knocked off James Horner as the lead for the \"Titanic\" soundtrack.  The mood is inspiring, the song crisp...  \"Secret Garden\" (Track 9) is a unique, one-of-a-kind musical experience, with modern keyboard strokes to excite the listener.  The song could easily fit into an Apple commercial, and most reminds me of the scene in \"Real Genius\" where Val Kilmer sneaks into the top secret military plane to tamper with its laser circuitry.  Last but not least, \"Holding Faith\" (Track 12) is an energetic synergy of sounds most reminiscent of Vangelis and \"Chariots of Fire\".If you enjoy Vangelis, Yanni, Enya, or the Electronic / New Age genres in general, you will be floored by Ryan Farish's \"Beautiful\", for \"Beautiful\" is truly perfect...\n", "val": 0.058232299983501434}

Listening to this CD is like taking a tour through new age and electronic music over the last twenty years: There's some of Enigma's arpeggio bells; a few chanting voices from Adiemus; some pleasant \"whoosh\" sounds from Jean Michelle Jarre; and them all topped off with some tastefully applied pan flute and simple Jim Brickman piano melodies.I realize my description makes this sound derivative.

{"text": "Beautiful is definitely the first title you should try if you're starting to explore Ryan Farish. This release shows his wide variety of musical color and feeling. He will vary the styles of each track from a simple beautiful piano ballad with almost churchlike electronic vocals...to a livelier style featuring an almost trance or chill dance beat with \"single-finger\" piano melodies with a definite hook. Get this one first and you'll know the breadth of his musical style.\n", "val": 0.03176725283265114}

{"text": "I along with many of you have discovered this artist thru The Weather Channel and their great music backgrounds. My personal favorite is \"Sunshine in the Rain\" I love all the little nuances of simple notes and background melodys. However, saying that, I will say that the only downside (if there is one) is that most all of Ryan's music seems to sound the same, the variety of style is not present as it is in artist such as Vangelis, Tangerine Dream, Synergy, or even, ah hem... Robert Wolf. Yes, I too have been guilty of favoring a certain keyboard or sound on that keyboard and put it into other songs, so I can't really blame Ryan for doing that, It all sounds good, we just have to be careful about monotony. Even so, I think this is an artist well worth listening to and I expect room to grow and more good things to come from such a young musician. I highly recommend it.\n", "val": 0.014501677826046944}
{"text": "Some reviewers have looked down their noses at Mr. Farish's efforts, hinting rather stuffily that his music has less worth than other music because it is simple.  To them I say, quit being snobs and loosen up.  To be sure, a lot of the piano work sounds like one could tap it out with one finger.  However, the point is...these songs are unique to Mr. Farish.  The reviewers sure haven't put out any CDs.  This music is nice to listen to and sure is relaxing.  I put it on at work and by George, I like it.

I tend to enjoy bands like Porcupine Tree, Pink Floyd, etc, so when you see an ad for an artist and an album with these similarities, you have to go for it.....I am so glad I have been following Paul and have even communicated with him several times...He's a great guy with a mission... to create a wonderful artful album....He has succeeded....  From the opening notes of Focal Point,  the album opener, (which by the way sounds great in the car with the windows open cruising at an accelerated speed,) it grabs you and pulls you in, you want to listen to more.....listen for \"chop sticks\" in the intro .. crazy, man!!! EverBlue -is pure Porcupine Tree with a bit of Marillion thrown in for good measure.Fade Away -is a track that grabbed me too, great piano work!!!!Soul Words -is a track with great hooks and a bit more \"in your face \" attitude..Scared to Dream and Touch- have got that Pink Floyd feel I can only suggest listening to them with the lights turned off and really listen it's that good....Senza Tempo,- which is one of my favorite tracks, has a certain latin flair,  and you can just imagine Paul doing his best David Gilmour guitar playing...Big Cars- is a fun rocker with that big arena sound, you actually feel like you are listening to cars whizzing by (and there's Steven Wison again with a big thumbs up... and doing this as a cover on the next Porcupine Tree album.....)Hold On- is a solid track as well, the vocals/guitar work really stand out on this one..Hello- the album closer, is another track full of thought out imagination... Pauls voice and the piano are perfect instruments in tune with each other....Well that's my take on it everyone.... with Fathers Day on the way, why on earth would you not purchase this incredible album for that music lover in your family... Paul Cusick's musicianship and vocals work so harmoniously on his debut... I might be biased,  having had the fortunate pleasure of hearing demos becoming artful pieces of magnificent work and watching in anticipation for the debut to come to fruation....Paul has me as an all time fan for life...  BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!! You won't regret it at all.....\n", "val": 0.031116800382733345}

{"text": "I am not a fan of any musician because that is idolatry, but I do have a sacred love for excellent music because of the affect it has on my entire being.  Because of his spirituality and his new relationship with his Heavenly Papa Jehovah, I am always on a treasure hunt, looking for Prince's music which that new spiritual man would invite any and every human to listen to, even children.  The single \"The Question Of U\" was my reward for such search.  I could play this single for my 87 year old mother and my 18 year old granddaughter and they would both be wore out from jammin' to it together, all night.  Prince's musical treasures that I did find in that search, always leaves me speechless and in tears for a few minutes.  They then inspire me to write.  The only thing I can utter from the bottom of my heart about \"The Question Of You\" is: there is only one music out there that is Supremely more superlative than this and I think of it every time I listen to \"The Question Of You.\"  That is, the nature's wonderland jam session that I and everyone living in a certain part of Hollywood California hear before the sunrise every morning.  When we open our bedroom window, countless species of bird-life with their own unique rhapsody, dare us to come out and jam with them.  Only for those very same birds at that same jam session, to wrap the evening up with a melodious lullaby that so gently tucks in the setting sun.  That jam session as does Prince's, reminds me of the \"jam sessions\" my stepfather use to describe that went on at the Cotton Club in the 30s and 40s.  Prince is the only musician of this age, that satisfies my hunger pains for such musicality of such excellence.  In this song, \"The Question Of U,\" Prince personally invites you in on his \"internal nature's wonderland jam session.\"  When he does sets you free, that freedom will leave you speechless, but oh! so satisfied.\n", "val": 0.0089271767064929}

The first three songs \"The Boys are Leaving Town\", \"Young Hearts Spark Fire\", and \"Wet Hair\"(especially \"Young Hearts Spark Fire\") are amazing, but I'd recommend getting it off iTunes or something because the rest of the album is semi-lackluster compared to the first three. \"Heart Sweats\" is actually pretty cool, I guess, and so is \"Rockers East Vancouver\", but I don't know, after the first three it all starts to sound a little too much the same. I can't even recall what those other songs sound like. And also this album kind of depressed me with all the fuzz. Check out The Pains of Being Pure at Heart because they are fuzzy like Japandroids, but they are pop-ier.

I've always has respect for bands that aren't afraid to put less than 12 songs on a album. To me it's to just take out the filler and work on the better songs. This seems to be the practice of japandroids. Even though some of the lyrics are repetetive they are always taken second next to the music, and they are pop-fest of originaliity.  I like how they are only a duo, but don't get caught up in incestrual nature of some duo. I even here some through backs to late 80s punk-hardcore, then drop in some  shoegaze in the same song.I wonder if i could convince anybody to buy this cd. probably not with all my poor verbage.  I don't even know the track listing right now, all i know is the song i'm on \"Heart Sweats\" freakin rocks.  It has a classic rock bravado feel close to that of mick jagger, without the usual context of a mickjagger wannabe.The next song crazy/forever, is sludgy, pulsing, arguably the best on the album.

{"text": "This is one of Rod Stewart's finest recordings in years.  With the possible exception of \"Unplugged ... and seated\", this collection of tunes is the nearest Roderick has come to matching the artistry of his early efforts, like \"Every Picture Tells a Story\" and \"Gasoline Alley\".There is truly something for everyone on this record.  If you are into hard rock, then check out \"Delicious\", Rod's compositional collaboration with ex-Duranie Andy Taylor (who previously teamed up with Rod to produce the fine \"Out of Order\").  Mr. Taylor also guests on \"Soothe Me\", the old Sam Cooke soul classic turned hard-rockin' guitar-fest.  A slightly more bluesy guitar-driven big-band romp is to be had with \"Hang on St. Christopher\", something one can just tell Rod wanted to record, not because it has any potential whatsoever to be a hit single, but rather because it is simply a great, if somewhat radio-unfriendly, tune.  Rounding out the up-tempo catagory, albeit in a slightly more mellow, acoustic vein, is \"Leave Virginia Alone\", a Tom Petty-penned gem that allows Rod to shine, just like he did in the old days.There are many ballads on this record, yet they do not repeat one another or sound even remotely alike.  \"This\", a truly touching romantic number, is sharply contrasted with the likes of \"Windy Town\", a tune about touring, and \"Sweetheart Like You\", a remake of the Bob Dylan classic.  On the latter tune in particular do we see Rod's ability to truly inhabit a song, becoming the protagonist completely, a man desperate to believe that his woman is far better than her surroundings, even though he knows that she is only slightly out of place.Be sure to check out the Rod-penned tune \"Muddy, Sam and Otis\", which give us an insight into the music that inspired Rod to dream of becoming a great soul singer (which he is, blue eyes and all).  Not only does Rod show us how these great soul men inspired him, but the song also functions as a lament for an era of music that is clearly behind us now.Curiously, the album closes with a lovely ballad called \"Purple Heather\".  Why do I say curiously?  Because the song is credited as being a Rod Stewart composition, when anyone even remotely familiar with either Irish or Scottish folk music will realize that this tune has been around for quite some time.  Even if the song isn't Rod's, the arrangement is, and this presentation works quite well.All in all, there is something for everyone on this album.  Song for song, the quality is much better than \"Vagabond Heart\", which, although it had a few moments of strength, was a bit uneven in terms of compositional quality.  Like the rest of Rod's better albums, this is a collection of Rod's originals, a few covers, and some great tunes penned by Rod's contemporaries.  If you like Rod, you'll love \"A Spanner in the Works\".\n", "val": 0.013278007507324219}

{"text": "Sometimes, we really need to be able to give a six star rating. This is one of those times.\"Carolina in My Mind\" was written and recorded by 19 year-old James Taylor at Abbey Studios, London, England at the same time the Beatles were laying down their last tracks as The Beatles.In fact, Paul McCartney played bass for the first release of \"Carolina in My Mind\" and George Harrison did back up harmony. (Paul McCartney appears in the LP's credits; George Harrison's contribution was noted but not printed on the LP jacket.)For goodness sake, \"Carolina in My Mind\" is to folk-rock what the Mona Lisa is to Renaissance paintings.The only way you cannot eternally enjoy this tune is if you just don't like the genre at all or you are James Taylor's next door neighbor and his dog keeps leaving his business in your yard.Other than that... you have to acknowledge \"Carolina in My Mind\" is the Great JT's masterpiece of popular folk rock.\n", "val": 0.006145815830677748}

{"text": "This is the best Christian meditation track I've come across. The recording of the narrator's voice is soft (no hisses into the microphone, etc.). He speaks slowly, allowing you time to think about what's being said. His inflection is perfect - not monotone, but not so intense that it ruins the relaxing mood. When I'm feeling anxious I just put on this track and by the end I'm breathing easy again. I was originally going to remove the beginning where he briefly tells you how to breathe, since I normally find that part boring, but his voice is so soothing it really helps set the mood.There's some light music in the background, which isn't distracting but nice when he takes brief pauses.Some of the track quotes scripture, some seems prayer-like, and some parts are just reminders about God's love. It's kept very general; I don't think any Christian would find any statement they disagree with.I'm so grateful to have found this series of meditation tracks. They are wonderful for anxiety but would also be useful just for those times when you're feeling distant from God or finding prayer difficult.\n", "val": 0.02097134478390217}

The bloke from Fashion and the fella from Pink Floyd put this album out in the 80s, and nothing happenedNot a very good record at all.

Her latest single Fallin' For You is honestly a very simple and mellow song.

I've noticed since doing this, that some of these products can actually help me fall-off quicker. Unfortunately, this is not one of those! In fact, I found this one annoying. I do realize that opinions on this subject are largely a matter of personal taste and preference, but I do feel that this recording has some major flaws, which many people will find fault with- as follows:First, the volume is NOT consistent. Some parts are loud; others are very soft. Some parts have a strong bass base [sorry...but I can't think of any better way to say to say that!) which I find to be very conducive for both masking noise, and inducing sleep- while in other sections, the bass goes almost flat. This not something you want when trying to sleep.Secondly: While it is not apparent in the sample track here on Amazon, a piano is used throughout this recording. In my opinion, although I do normally enjoy piano music; pianos are not conducive to sleep.Thirdly: There is a simple, repetitive melodic theme played by the piano, throughout. Having an identifiable melody- especially a constantly repeating one- is NOT a good thing when trying to sleep- it creates monotony; anticipation; expectation; and awareness of time.Three big fails, in my book- but hey, for the price, it was worth a shot!\n", "val": 3.1595573091180995e-05}

{"text": "I have tried quite a few meditation audio pieces, but nothing beats this ONE!!! This is simply fantastic and I mean it from the bottom of my soul. This is a 30 min piece. At the beginning, the music takes quite a bit of time to calm you down. So once you start and if you don't feel calm enough quickly, don't throw this away. Probably by the 15th minute or so, the body begins to feel the tingling of relaxation and by close to the 20th minute, you feel really relaxed. Close to the end of it, it feels like your body if floating in thin air and by that time, there also seems to be a splurge of cold air flowing right from the bottom to the top hitting your face. You will really feel this. I am just writing what I felt throughout my session. I didn't want it to end, but it had to at 30 mins. So I am now going to put this on repeat mode and do it for even 1 hr. Its THAT GOOD! During my session towards the end, I was more spiritually inclined towards the God that I pray to and it became easier for me to try and visualize him.

{"text": "I just saw Shemekia Copeland perform at the River St. Jazz Cafe in Wilkes-Barre, PA, USA. Words cannot capture the power and soul she possesses. She owned the room...keeping every eye and - of course - EAR on  her as she and her band sang the blues for an enraptured audience. Opening  with BIG LOVIN' WOMAN, she grabbed each of us out of our chairs and kept us  swayin' (sometimes along with her when she strutted onto the dance floor  and through the cafe) through a night of blues including such works of  mastery as the saucy I ALWAYS GET MY MAN, the hand-clappin' SUSPICION and  MY TURN BABY, the soulful MARRIED TO THE BLUES and SALT IN MY WOUNDS (the  latter of which shall be featured on the soundtrack to THREE TO TANGO -  expected Summer '99) and ending the evening with one of her father's songs,  one she dedicated to him, GHETTO CHILD...her rendering of which will remain  in my bones forever.Following her spirited and all-out encore, Shemekia  sat down at the bar and received her fans, proving that not only is she a  Diva, but a LADY as well.TURN UP THE HEAT, a \"portable  Shemekia\" is a necessity - as anyone who encounters this DIVA will  absolutely NEED to keep her close by.Shemekia has been compared to Etta  James and The Queen, Aretha Franklin. Such lofty likenings can be quite  intimidating and nearly impossible to fulfill...but not for Shemekia. She  is on her way to joining them at the helm of the blues universe.I have  met the future of the blues. Her name is SHEMEKIA COPELAND. Her CD is TURN  UP THE HEAT.\n", "val": 0.010127264074981213}

{"text": "Not a blues record per se, Johnny \"Clyde\" Copeland's daughter's debut album is a tough 63 minutes of blues, blues-rock, R&B and swaggering soul stompers. Shemekia Copeland has a terrific voice for this kind of music, strong and versatile, and she is backed by a fine combo which includes keyboardist Brian Mitchell (piano and organ) and top-notch guitarist Jimmy Vivino.\"Turn The Heat Up\" is a wonderfully accessible album; it draws from classic soul and blues but presents its material with a rock n' roll-like edge, and Shemekia Copeland delivers it in a delightfully bluesy no-frills fashion.The Uptown Horns appear on a few songs, lending additional juice and texture to the already muscular title track, and everybody with a taste for soul and R&B should be able to find something to groove on here.A couple of songs are a bit too long for their own good, and \"Turn The Heat Up\" is ultimately too predictable to be truly magnificent...you can't help but feel you've heard this music before. But it is a really, really solid debut album, and the most impressive thing about it is perhaps the consistently high quality of the material assembled here. There is not a single real clunker here, and that's a rare feat by any artist.It took me a while to really appreciate this album; at first I thought it formulaic and repetitive, but it started to get to me around the third or fourth listen. Shemekia Copeland has plenty of talent, the songs she sings are very well-chosen, and she is fortunate enough to be working with a really great band.The many highlights include the aforementioned title track, the soulful slow numbers \"Married To The Blues\", \"Ghetto Child\" and \"Salt In My Wounds\", the swinging R&B of \"Suspicion\" and \"Big Lovin' Woman\", and the grinding blues \"Has Anybody Seen My Man\". But everything is worth a listen, really, even if everything isn't equally memorable. Guitarist Vivino plays some terrific liquid guitar fills, and Brian Mitchell's piano playing is never less than excellent. The seven-minute slow blues \"It Don't Hurt No More\" could have easily overstayed its welcome, but it doesn't, thanks mainly to Shemekia's vocal prowess and Mitchell's piano. This is a really good album.\n", "val": 0.03179745376110077}

{"text": "Imagine my surprise last summer in attending a free bluesfest in Denver and being confronted for the first time by the powerful voice of the teenage Ms. Copeland, who would have ripped the roof off the place, except  it was an outdoor concert. \"Turn the Heat Up\" doesn't quite  capture the power of her live show, but it gets pretty close.Her live  show started with \"Big Lovin' Woman,\" which I was happy to see on  the CD. It's a big, brassy song with a huge sound: Shemekia relies on an  amped-up, electrified blues attack, but not because she's trying to cover  up a thin voice. Not by a long shot. In fact, she could probably carry an  album on her voice alone. The good news is that in song after song (try  \"Your Mama's Talkin'\" if you have trouble getting started some  morning) the album has both: a blockbuster band that has to cook to keep up  with its leader.The album holds up for 14 songs, but for me the set  revolves around her rendition of her father Johnny Copeland's moving  \"Ghetto Child,\" a neglected classic. It's the kind of slow  blues/soul shout that doesn't allow a singer to hide: either the chops are  there to bring it off or they're not. Shemekia steps up to the plate and  delivers one of the best vocal blues performances I've heard in a long  time, doing homage to the music and to her father. When she sings,  \"This is the part that moves me so much,\" you believe her.This  is the kind of contribution that is going to keep the blues alive. Hats off  to Shemekia and her band. She's young, gifted and we want to hear a lot  more from her.\n", "val": 0.018069345504045486}

{"text": "After listening to this, or, rather, trying to listen to it a few times before deleting, the title seems strikingly arrogant and presumptuous. Even funny, albeit in a bad way.I have composed a lot of music with a keyboard workstation, which allows for all kinds of creative sounds, and know how easy it is with such an instrument to press a few buttons and then a few keys, and produce something listenable. One can almost do it at random and sometimes create things more enjoyable (or, though slightly harder, relaxing) to listen to than this so called \"probably the best music for relaxation and meditation\" material.The fact there are several good reviews may illustrate the subjective quality of \"music,\" and personal experience therein. Or, here, something else, since the reviews don't make a lot of sense in light of the material. Even accounting for personal difference, it is hard to find something on amazon where the reviews are so far removed from what seems to be the quality of the item itself.This sounded like hokey new age music, with annoying little staccato fluffs thrown in that made it less relaxing than most new age music I have heard. Perhaps it gets better after fifteen minutes or so. But I couldn't get that far, since it was too annoying to listen to. And very little in the way of \"relaxing music\" is too annoying to listen to. Though the heady claims of the title might have decreased tolerance for what sounds like hokey, at times irritating noise, this somehow managed to be precisely that. Namely \"too annoying to listen to;\" and quite a distinction from the title claim.\n", "val": 5.1792205340461805e-05}

Still, he has been away for awhile, but honestly it still is much better after awhile, than all the lackluster songs from the wannabe performers like the Pussycat Dolls, Jordin Sparks & others.

After a very lengthy absence of the spotlight, he has shown to have a much better soul-driven sound than he had honestly made when he came out in the industry years ago. That has been well-proof with BlackSummers'Night, which won 2 Grammy Awards for him, including Best R&B Album. He has had pretty good songs from that album including the intimate Pretty Wings and Bad Habits, but he has shown it again with Fistful Of Tears, the third single of BlackSummers' Night. The song really is very intimate, and shows that Maxwell has continued that striking sound well. I like the song a lot, and it honestly is better than a lot of the joke acts that have came out this past year so far including Justin Bieber and Rihanna.

{"text": "This is an MP3 version of the 20-CD set \"The Golden Age of the Romantic Piano Concerto\", (which is about 10x the price). The performances and recordings vary in quality, but in general are quite good. Michael Ponti, whose interpretations are always worth hearing, is featured frequently. Most of the works presented here are rarely recorded, so this set offers an opportunity to expand beyond the typical Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Brahms, Beethoven, and Rachmaninoff who tend to dominate the recorded repertoire. Many of these pieces are unjustly neglected, as you'll soon hear when you listen to them. Several of these are also available on the Hyperion series The Romantic Piano Concerto, but you'll pay more for a single disc from that set than you will for this entire collection. I recommend to buy this set first and decide which composers and works speak to you, then look at acquiring other recordings of those works.Needless to say, at this price, I didn't hesitate.Full contents are listed below:1-3 Johann Baptist Cramer, Piano Concerto No. 5 in C minor Op. 484 Carl Czerny, Divertissement de concert Op. 2045-7 Ferdinand Ries, Piano Concerto No. 3 in C sharp minor Op. 558-10 Muzio Clementi, Piano Concerto in C11-13 John Field, Piano Concerto No 2 in A flat H3114-16 Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Piano Concerto in G Op. 7317-19 Ignaz Moscheles, Piano Concerto in G minor Op. 5820-22 Ferdinand Hiller, Piano Concerto No. 2 in F sharp minor Op. 6923-26 Henry Litolff, Concerto symfonique No. 3 in E flat Op. 4527-29 Friedrich Kalkbrenner, Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor Op. 6130-32 Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Piano Concerto No. 4 in E Op. 110 \"Les Adieux\"33-39 Carl Mari von Weber, Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Op. 11; Piano Concerto No. 2 in E flat Op. 32; Konzertsuck for piano and orchestra in F minor Op. 7940 Robert Volkmann, Konzertsuck for piano and orchestra Op. 4241-43 Adolf von Henselt, Piano Concerto in F minor Op. 1644 Ferdinand Hiller, Konzertsuck for piano and orchestra Op. 11345 Fryderyk Chopin, Allegro de concert in A Op. 4646-49 Moritz Moszkowski, Piano Concerto in E Op. 5950-52 Xaver Scharwenka, Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor Op. 5653-55 Joachim Raff, Piano Concerto in C minor Op. 18556 Mihaly Mosonyi, Piano Concerto in E minor57-59 Bernhard Stavenhagen, Piano Concerto No. 1 in B minor Op. 460-62 Felix Mendelssohn Concerto for Violin and Piano in D minor MWV O 463-65 Felix Mendelssohn Piano Concerto in A minor MWV O 266 Franz Liszt, Malediction67 Eugen d'Albert, Piano Concerto No. 2 in E Op. 1268-70 Hans von Bronsart, Piano Concerto in F sharp minor Op. 1071 Franz Berwald, Piano Concerto No. 1 in D72 Charles-Henri Alkan, Concerto da camera No. 2 in C sharp minor73 Robert Schumann, Konzertstuck in G Op. 9274 Joachim Raff, Ode to Spring Op. 7675 Franz Liszt, Totentanz76-78 Simon Mayr, Piano Concerto No. 1 in C79-81 Albert Roussel, Piano Concerto in G Op. 3682-84 Gabriel Pierne, Piano Concerto in C minor Op. 1285-89 Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Piano Concerto No. 3 in E flat Op. 75/79; Concert Fantasy Op. 5690-92 Christian Sinding, Piano Concerto in D flat Op. 693-94 Hermann Goetz, Piano Concerto No. 2 in B flat Op. 1895-97 Carl Reinecke, Piano Concerto No. 1 in F sharp minor Op. 7298 Felix Mendelssohn, Capriccio brillant Op. 2299-101 Josef Rheinberger, Piano Concerto in A flat Op. 94102-104 Anton Rubinstein, Piano Concerto No. 4 in D minor Op. 70105-107 Sigismond Thalberg, Piano Concerto in F minor Op. 5108-109 Nikolai Medtner, Piano Concerto No. 3 in E minor Op. 60110-111 Mily Balakirev, Piano Concerto No. 2 in E flat112 Sergei Lyapunov, Rhapsody on Ukranian Themes113-115 Edouard Lalo, Piano Concerto in F minor116 Alexander Glazunov, Piano Concerto No. 2 in B Op. 100117-119 George Gershwin, Concerto in F for piano and orchestra120-122 Samuel Barber, Piano Concerto Op. 38123-125 Edward MacDowell, Piano Concerto No. 2 in D minor Op. 23126-129 Amy Beach, Piano Concerto in C sharp minor Op. 45\n", "val": 0.013894174247980118}
{"text": "This album captures with absolute fairness the superlative performance given by Mr. Ponti at the moment to play Rubinstein's Piano concerto No. 4 in D minor.Until those times, the pianistic literature around the figure of Anton Rubinstein was extremely reduced. The other two relevant previous performances were Oscar Levant with Mitropoulos and Raymond Lewenthal with Calvalho and London Symphony. But any of them reaches such febrile tension and inspirational reverie like this one. Ponti was a remarkable pianist and besides, he was absolutely committed with the Russian  piano music. As a matter of fact he has been the only Western pianist -and maybe in the world- who dared to play the complete piano works of Rachmaninov, Scriabn and Tchaikovsky. So he had the technique and expression whcih allowed them to convey the listener about an idiomatic version of this frequently neglected amnd overlooked Piano Concerto. We should not forget the personal contribution of Adrian Ruiz playing the Piano Concerto No. 5 dedicated to Alkan's memory. Thanks to Lewenthal, Ruiz and Ponti, there was an evident interest in order to record the rest of these Piano Concertos since the middle seventies.The Thalberg Piano Concerto in F Op. 5 is very well played but the score hasn't the fire of Rubinstein.Don't think it twice and buy this album. It will reward you for a long, long time.\n", "val": 0.024203473702073097}

It always moves me to tears when I hear this as I think of my beloved father who died of cancer several years ago.  I see his big, sad blue-green eyes and think of him when the lyrics say, \"Who can say for certain, maybe you are still here.\"  He is always here in my heart, anyway and certainly he is with the angels just beyond my grasp.  That is where \"To Where You Are\" ascends to, that is, where the angels are.  Thank you Josh for your lush, soaring, yet tender voice.  Its beauty and power definitely ascend to where the angels are.\n", "val": 0.05023685470223427}

The thankfulness will eventually trump the anger.Recommend this also:  Where Were You  Bob Dufford S.J.http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=where%20were%20you%20bob%20duffordI am also reminded of some powerful word from a Dean Koontz novel:\"Grief can destroy you-- or focus you. You can decide a relationship was all for nothing if it had to end in death, and you alone.Or you can realize that every moment of it had more meaning than you dared to recognize at the time, so much meaning it scared you, so you just lived, just took for granted the love and laughter of each day, and didn't allow yourself to consider the sacredness of it.But when it's over and you're alone, you begin to see it wasn't just a movie and a dinner together, not just watching sunsets together, not just scrubbing a floor or washing dishes together or worrying over a high electric bill.It was everything, it was the why of life,Every event and precious moment of it. The answer to the mystery of existence is the love you shared sometimes so imperfectly, and when the loss wakes you to the deeper beauty of it, to the sanctity of it, you can't get off your knees for along time, you're driven to your knees not by the weight of the loss but by gratitude for what preceded the loss.And the ache is always there, but one day not the emptiness, because to nurture the emptiness, to take solace in it, is to disrespect the gift of life.\"  Stephen Koontz, \"Odd Hours\", Chapter 32\n", "val": 0.005255772266536951}

It honestly is a very weak and dormid song for Mariah, compared to her more upbeat R&B and Pop hits from her earlier records, like It's Like That and Honey. I wasn't as impressed at all.

{"text": "There honestly is no question about the lack of great songs on the radio out there. For Mariah Carey, she honestly has had a lot of lackluster songs that have really been in place on the radio. With the less-than-appealing scale of E=MC2, Mariah tries to deliver a darker song that loses its way heart and soul to the strength of what Mariah should honestly do. That is definitely the case with her latest single Obsessed, the first from her upcoming album Memoris Of An Imperfect Angel. The song is a far departure from the more upbeat and driven songs Mariah had been known for delivering. It really was made in regards against rapper Eminem for targeting Mariah and her husband Nick Cannon and their relationship. It honestly doesn't feel like a actual beef between the two of them, nor does Mariah score the way she used to. If you really must know, I enjoyed Whitney Houston's title track to her upcoming album I Look To You 10x more, and I absolutely recommend that as a must buy for your MP3 player over Obsessed. Mariah really needs to find better material for her music, otherwise she could windup having a huge flop on her hands.

{"text": "Mariah Carey knows what the people like (well, usually). Most importantly, she knows how to take contemporary trends and graft them onto what she does best - solid, melodic r&b and pop with expressive, expansive vocals.\"Obsessed\" largely nails this, and with its gutsy attitude commands more attention, at least immediately, than previous singles \"Touch My Body\" and \"It's Like That.\" It also firmly silences any detractors who chastize Carey for releasing soundalike lead singles; her last bunch of them could not sound less alike, and this one is a particular departure for her.However, while \"Obsessed\" may be precision-tooled to ignite water cooler gossip with its laugh-out-loud jibes at Eminem (\"You're a mom and pop/I'm a corporation\" is a line likely to be remembered for some time) it is also unrelatable to the general public and, unlike her strongest hits of this decade, including even \"Touch My Body,\" offers essentially no moment to let her voice propel above the drum machines and studio magic. Given her moniker of The Voice, this may dismay some listeners who erroneously pine for a return to the fuller-voiced but far less interesting Sony-driven Mariah of the early to mid '90s.Vocals and relatibility aside, however, \"Obsessed\" is a solid piece of strong pop and a welcome taste for September's full-length album \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel,\" Carey's 11th studio LP.

If you want to see an eagle, you have to be very lucky or willing to brave the wilderness.  And snakes don't survive by exposing themselves to humans, so you're more likely to find them dead than alive.  That Ray Wylie Hubbard sees, knows and cares about such things, derives wisdom by observing the process and is capable of capturing it in a song makes me want to thank God for placing such talent on the earth.  He's obviously willing to brave the wilderness, literally and figuratively, and the result is a stunning collection of songs.This CD was my initiation to this guy's body of recorded work.

{"text": "Ray Wylie Hubbard deserves an award for the titles of his CDs: \"Growl, Loco Gringo's Lament, Delirium Tremolos,\" and \"Crusades of the Restless Knights,\" maybe the best title of them all.  \"Crusades\" is folk music mixed with country and gospel, heavy on the metaphysics and as always with more than a hint of rowdiness.\"The Messenger\" is my favorite song on the CD.  Ray's recorded it before, but this time he does it with a quavery voice and strong backing vocals by Patty Griffin.  \"The River Bed\" is another good one.  He describes the song as \"A quarter moon, a river bed, a beautiful woman...she just happens to be dead.\"  That'll give you the flavor of Hubbard's songs: death and Texas, Rilke and Buddha, love and cocaine, Jesus and a hot woman in a \"Red Dress.\"A song I don't like on this CD is \"Conversation with the Devil\" which is too obviously derivative from an early Bob Dylan number, but all the others are good to great.  A touching number is \"Airplane Fell Down in Dixie\" which is a subtle tribute. I won't tell you to who (whom?); you'll have to figure that out yourself.  Hubbard, as usual, supplements his weathered voice and acoustic guitar with a collection of instruments and fine players. Dobro, fiddle, and mandolin are prominent. A cardboard box is used on one number -- and Ray learned to play slide guitar for this CD.\"Crusades\" is one of half a dozen outstanding CDs Ray Wylie Hubbard has made over the last decade. The title of this review, by the way, comes from Ray's description of one of his songs.  He says he hit two out of the six.Smallchief\n", "val": 0.01902266964316368}

{"text": "Ray has plugged away for decades trying to live down the memory of writing \"Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother\".  Anyone coming into this or any other Ray disc expecting this sort of barroom sing-along is in the wrong place.  Ray writes deep, funny, touching songs with excellent musicianship to back it up.In his live shows, you have the benefit of hearing the stories behind the songs, and you can see the true skill Ray has acquired at playing the guitar.  He really seems to believe what he is singing in every instance, as if he has felt every emotion that is put forth.In said live shows, the biggest reaction goes to \"Conversations With the Devil\", which threatens to be his new signature song.  It is perhaps the most funny, yet also insightful, thing he has written, and I would think he would gladly replace Redneck Mother with this newer work.The sound is stripped-down - Ray with a few players - but that's all he needs.  The power of the songwriting and performance come through in what is perhaps one of the best country albums in a long time.  Forget Nashville.  Ray is creating art in Texas.\n", "val": 0.02213140018284321}

{"text": "I love this soundtrack.  It brought to mind an album that came out last year, for a movie that also starred Angelina Jolie.  That soundtrack was for \"Gone in 60 Seconds.\"  It had many techno songs, and some hip-hop and rock, just like this album.  I enjoyed every song, except for some of the hip-hop.  Just like this album, there were songs by Moby, BT, and Chemical Brothers.  This album has just a little hip-hop, and I enjoy what was included.  The new Nine Inch Nails song is great, although it does not top Trent's best soundtrack song, and in my opinion his best song of all time, The Perfect Drug.  The remix of U2's song \"Elevation\" adds more to an already great song.  The same thing goes for the Missy Elliot - Nelly Furtado mix of \"Get UR Freak On.\"  Nelly adds a lot off sass to this already sassy song.  All of the electronic acts on here are great, it is hard to pick one song to talk about.  I esspecially love the Fatboy Slim song, which features Bootsy Collins.  Fatboy Slim worked with Bootsy Collins on his last album on the song \"Weapon of Choice,\" which has the video featuring a dancing Christopher Walken.  There are some lesser known bands at the end, and all contribute great material to this movie.  If the movie is half as action packed as this album, I am going to be the first in line to see it.\n", "val": 0.01857439987361431}

I have to say- the \"remix\" of Elevation is great, but i cant really tell the album version and the remix apart very well.  The nine inch nails song is OK- they've had better.  But the Missy Elliot and Nelly Furtado remix of Get Your Freak On was one of the worst that ive heard in years.  Nelly Furtado and Missy do not mix well, and the chemistry is not there.  Yet the Chemical brothers song is kicking, just like all of their other songs, upbeat and heavy thumping.  Moby is on just about every sountrack, and he sounds alright.  I think the score will be good- i heard fatboy slim was going to compose the score.  While this cd has some good electronic music for electronica fans as myself- the bands that are known don't do the best job on this soundtrack.  Yet, even though some of the tracks aren't the best, this sountrack is perfect for what the movie is going to be: upbeat, lively, and awesome.\n", "val": 0.010812051594257355}

Moby's sonic landscapes, Outkast's tight and innovative raps make for a well-rounded arsenal of artistry. \"Get Your Freak On\" throws Nelly Furtado into a harder environment than her melodic pop single, and the coupling of her with Missy Elliot is a fantastic idea, as the two of them add equal parts sugar and spice.The bottom line is that, with a bunch of fantastic new songs from talented artists and a remix of a new U2 track, the Tomb Raider soundtrack has covered all the bases.

Naah.And that steel player on the recording is outstanding.C. GentryArlington, Texas\n", "val": 0.0056945523247122765}
{"text": "Country music is nothing if not reliable. We know what to expect from classic country tunes:  a good dose of despair tempered with a shot of wry humor, and a pedal steel that'll make you cry.  With \"Too Much Living\", Danny Balis accomplishes all of the above while creating arrangements and penning thoughtful songs that stand apart from the expected while still evoking the style and sound that was decimated long ago by Nashville brass.  Written and performed entirely after the tragic death of Balis' best friend and bandmate Carter Albrecht, the album examines the aftermath of loss as it plows its way through relationships and blazes a trail of self-destruction. Though \"Tethered\" and \"Three of Nine\"  rank among some of the most melancholy country songs you'll ever love, tracks like \"Beyond the Walls of Loneliness\" and \"Autumn Leaves\" hope you'll put down your beer long enough to take a whirl around the dance floor. It's this combination that pushes \"Too Much Living\" beyond mere reliability and into the realm of country and western revelation.\n", "val": 0.011506438255310059}

{"text": "When going through items that I had not yet reviewed I came across this. I was totally baffled at when or how I bought this because I did not recall buying it. I asked my husband if he had purchased it, but he acted as if he had no idea what I was talking about so I assumed our toddler must have somehow did it on accident. Upon listening to it, I was assured it was definitely not my husband that had bought it, and I had no reason to believe that our daughter randomly stumbled across it so I decided to go read up more about it. Once I started reading the reviews, it finally all made sense to me. Regardless, giving the song some credit because it's not really my preferred genre, I found the song itself to be pretty dark. Too, while it's free and everyone loves free, I didn't really like that it was just randomly downloaded without my permission or consent, as I wouldn't have really wanted my toddler to listen to it, especially once she is a little older and actually understands why it means. If you liked the genre and had just been cheated on though, maybe you'd actually like the song.\n", "val": 4.3758143874583766e-05}

I wouldn't change the channel on this song, but I wouldn't seek it out either. I'm sure it has it's audience, but when you give it to EVERYONE for free without a choice, well... people hate free things that don't hurt them in the slightest and that they can get rid of easily.

I wish these two got more recognition, they definitely deserve to be heard. There's this little obscure radio station in my area that plays music that's more off the beaten track, up and coming from across the pond, local bands. The kind of music that refreshingly doesn't come from the Top 20 with Ryan Seacrest on Saturdays. I first heard Hozier on this radio station, before \"Take Me To Church\" made it to the main waves.

{"text": "I wasn't aware we had acquired this until asked to review it and just listened to it.  Despite some good lines in the lyrics, the instrumentation is often shrill and discordant.  It wasn't as bad as chalk screeching on the blackboard, but it is not something I would have deliberately.  The singers have good voices, and if I were more curious, I might try to find out why they chose to use the instruments the way they did.  To be fair, I do know people that would enjoy this, they like \"experimental\" music, but for me, it was like listening to the kind of jazz or classical music that only real aficionados can appreciate, where the nuances and subtleties go beyond the individual skills and into a realm of appreciation I simply lack.  I dislike reviewing music because tastes are so individual and I suggest  what I suggest to folks I take to a new restaurant.  Taste it, if you don't like it, don't finish it.  But I listened to the whole song.  If you know these folks, you probably already like them, if you don't, hit the 30 second sampler or go to youtube and listen to a video.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

{"text": "Can the 49 reviewers who preceded me be wrong? Perhaps, but then I'm going to make it an even fifty. This is a very fine soundtrack album whose main theme is compelling in the extreme -- I believe it's used now in television coverage of The Players Tournament. Much but not all of the music consists of variations on that main theme, but the score maintains enough variety and change of mood to be engaging. My only quibble, and it's a very small one, is that while the film is presumably set in the late 1800s or early 1900s in Australia, some of the music has a bit of a modern quasi-pop sound. That effect doesn't last long, and if we take the score just on its own that incongruity really doesn't matter -- it deals with the relation of the music to the actual film. Even with the quibble I'd give it five starts.\n", "val": 0.00258044945076108}

In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track. If you like great western themed or classical music and have never seen the movie, you'll also like this soundtrack.Strongly recommended.\n", "val": 0.04856698587536812}
{"text": "Movie soundtracks are usually not something I'm very interested in.  Most of the music seems pretty incongruous with one another.

Occasionally though there are wonderful exceptions to this rule.  \"The Lost Boys\" \"The Firm\" \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" \"American Graffiti\" are a few good examples.  \"The Man from Snowy River\" was also a wonderful exception to this rule.  Big, simple, monumental, humble, flowing, dark, beautiful...lots of contrasts, but it all flows together wonderfully.  Thank you.\n", "val": 0.004225351382046938}
{"text": "United States film buffs were just becoming aware of the film offerings from Australia in the early 1980s,. Mel Gibson with his \"Mad Max\" movies was becoming quite popular. Peter Weir had given us \"Gallipoli,\"  \"The Year of Living Dangerously,\" and \"The Picnic at Hanging Rock,\" and \"Witness\" with Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis.  During this time, a new label that specialized and motion picture soundtracks popped up on the scene. Varese Sarabande gave us access to lower profile soundtracks which mainly appealed to ST collectors that never would have been released under any other major label. Their early releases included the soundtracks to \"The Right Stuff,\" \" Year Of Living Dangerously,\" and \"Witness.\"  One a little sleeper entitled \"The Man from Snowy River\" was released to no particular fanfare in the US, but it was causing a bit of a stir down under. I don't think anyone in the United States and ever heard of Bruce Broughten at this time. The only other soundtrack he is written close to the release of this film that I can remember was to \"Silverado.\"  But Kirk Douglas was in the film, and back then he still had star power.This was the time of the early years of MTV and HBO. That was way before you head 18,000 channels of nothing from the cable companies. You also didn't have to wait three years to see a premium movie on the HBO channel. I watched \"The Man from Snowy River\" reluctantly at the insistence of my roommate. He said the music was good.  He was right.  Music on the this album is  uplifting, pleasant, occasionally exhilarating. Basically, the music that is contained on the soundtrack album is three or four very short themes some of which reoccur several times. We are presented with a Main Theme in the opening of the film and it repeats in the tracks Jim's Ride Jim Brings In The Brumbles, and the End Titles. The real standout here is Jessica's theme. It is a beautiful piano arrangement, and it has remained popular since the release of the film.What you really have here is a man who can write a melody and lay it down on top of broken chords. For fans of this film, the soundtrack album would be a nice addition to your ST collection. The music on CD evokes memories of a very simple film, telling a very simple story of love and loyalty. It is a trip down memory lane. The music is pleasant  but nowhere on the level of John Williams (at least at this point in his career).  But this film didn't require an epic score to tell  it's story.\n", "val": 0.016163356602191925}

{"text": "This film is civil and reasonable.  Most modern \"westerns\" are pessimistic, silly, violent, and have nothing to do with tradition.  This is odd because they epitify the definition of tradition in the U.S.  Some years ago I stopped watching new movies period because they have become of the things Hollywood and Canada concentrate  on.  So I miss the occasional reasonable film that is released to the public.  I just found this one.  It is a must-see and very appropriate for family.  The opening scene seems a little negative but the rest of the movie is just grand.  There is a sequel but I haven't seen it.This movie is set in Australia but will be appealing to anyone who likes Westerns, horses, mountain men stories, etc, etc.\n", "val": 0.007130923215299845}
{"text": "This beautiful soundtrack from the wonderful family film \"The Man From Snowy River\" is one of the most memorable movie soundtracks ever composed. Every time I listen to it, I am swept to turn of the century Australia, to a wild and dangerous world being settled by people of courage and heart.The music, while lovely on it's own (I have told my daughter that she must have \"Jessica's Theme\" in her wedding - it's a good thing she loves it too!), will, in my mind, always be tied strongly to the film itself and the wonderful characters we met there. Jim, Jessica, Clancy and the others seem to float through the music, and I can almost hear the crack of the whip, and see the snow flying under running hooves.Every time I listen to the soundtrack, I want to see the film again. Twenty years after their release, I think that says something about both of them. The little rift of 'Waltzing Matilda\" worked into \"End Titles\" almost always brings a few tears to my eyes, and makes me think of the pride the Australian people must have in their heritage.\n", "val": 0.04409726709127426}

To think that our children are enjoying it as much as us adults, a generation after the release of the movie in 1982, is just stunning, and shows how this music is timeless, and how, in years to come, it will rate as a classic, along with the poems of Banjo Patterson himself. Thank goodness it has been revived on stage/arena in 2002 with stunning reviews. We can all relive it again.\n", "val": 0.04842650145292282}

A majestic feeling envelopes when listening to Jim Brings In The Brumbies.  Romantic and touching are Jessica's Sonata and Henry Dies/Farewell To Frew.  This CD is a MUST for any music lover!

{"text": "The Man from Snowy River. Written in 1998 by Bruce Rowland, this score is excellent for anybody who likes strings, French horn, horses, and piano! Unlike most soundtracks, every single track on this CD is worth  listening  to, (Like Medal of Honor) with a mixture of strings, horns, and two tracks  that are piano. Although the music is  very inspirational, one thing that  it is missing is the big orchestral sound that most soundtracks have. (Take  Cutthroat  Island for instance) Most of the tracks on this CD have their  own theme, with the main theme occasionally mixed in. Other tracks, such as  \"Jessica's theme\" and \"Jessica's Sonata\" are gorgeous  piano pieces. (although strings do come in later on Jessica's theme) Most  of the music on this CD is packed with excitement, such as \"Jim's  Ride\", \"The Chase\", and \"The Brumbies\".  \"Clancy's theme\" is a track played primarily by strings. Had  their been bagpipes playing this piece, it would sound like an Irish song.  If you like inspirational music and piano pieces, this would match that  category more then enough!

{"text": "First the things I disliked. There is nothing here in the way of liner notes other than the track list itself. No release year, no history, no personnel, nothing about the Marine Band, nothing. The tracks are presented in alphabetical order. Other than the bar code this looks like a CD you would burn yourself to give to a friend. Or a bootleg. Since works of the US government, including audio recordings, are in the public domain, I wonder if this is actually a \"legal bootleg\" (not endorsed by the Marine Band, but still legal).But that's the end of my complaints. 18 tracks at this price is a great deal. The sound quality is excellent. The music is played with military precision, as you would expect from the Marine Band. There is a bit of audio compression applied but not so much to ruin the dynamics. Some of the horns sound like they were close to the mic but that just adds to the charm.Comparing these to the 1890s Columbia recordings of the Marine Band when Sousa was still conductor (although apparently didn't conduct on the recordings), the tempos are noticeably faster, in line with other modern recordings. Otherwise the performances are very close.\n", "val": 0.005232501775026321}

However, there are no liner notes or anything else to further your education. But, if you used to march to these tunes, as I did when young, you won't stand up and salute. The Stars and Stripes Forever is played like chamber music: genteel, but not too boisterous. The worst disappointment is the lackluster rendition of The Gallant Seventh.

Owl City's Fireflies hits the nadir in every way that matters: the \"vocalist\" sings, in a cloyingly earnest and sincere manner, that, \"I'd get a thousand hugs/from ten thousand lightning bugs/as they tried to teach me how to dance.\" Yeah, it's THAT bad. I'm not even kidding. It's like some art-school dropout decided to try his hand at poetry, and, upon realizing that he didn't have the first clue where to begin, went right ahead and stole all the stupid one-liners from a box of Hallmark Cards -- and then forced them all to rhyme together. The vocals are sickeningly-sweet HORRIBLE -- imagine a forced sincerity done in self-autotune (!); the lyrics are nothing but a poorly described bad acid trip -- and the whole stupid mess is placed over \"music\" that is probably a dumbed-down version of the theme from Sesame Street, but played slightly out-of-key and slowed-down to make it even more unappealing to anybody with ears.Absolutely rancid.\n", "val": 3.212543742847629e-05}

It's all about the gimmicky electronic, over-processed vocals used to disguise the singer's inability to carry a tune in a bucket.  The avoidance of actual musical instruments means that anyone with a Casio keyboard and a less than mediocre voice can crank out a \"hit\" song.  I'd like to hear this guy sing live with a real piano, or some other actual non-electric instrument, and see just how he really sounds.

It's a cross between Death Cab for Cutie and Royksopp, which in my opinion, does not get any better. The overall arrangement of this song is incredible. Adam Young's voice compliments it beautifully and neither overpowers the other. It has elements of electronica, the violins are a nice accompaniment and it has a smooth beat that will get your head bobbing whether you like it or not. The melody stays the same throughout the song but the brilliance of it, is the occasional isolations of the piano with the vocals as well as the isolation of the beat allowing for different sound levels. The lyrics are a refreshing break from the usual topics of current hits.

The fresh, original lyrics make it stand out from the plethora of whinging love songs you hear on public radio. I could relate to it, because, like Young, I'm an insomniac.

The low-dubbed, dancehall reggae sound displayed here is some of the best I have ever heard in reggae and all coming from a guy that looks like an ordained rabbi. After the original print of this album was stopped, I ran across a copy before the prices on ebay got outrageous. If you got into Matisyahu through one of his recent album than this might not be for you. There is not a pop song to be found on this disc and no 'wall-of-sound' production techniques used to overproduce a song. It literally sounds like it was recorded in a Jamaican fishermans basement (I can practically smell the jerk-chicken listening to this thing).This is not the same Matisyahu of today, however; this was somebody who felt the music, felt the vibes, who had a message to speak and bad-ass beats to back it up. Now he just sounds like a bad Sean Paul rip-off(making poppy dance hits), which is sad, considering Shake Off The Dust...Arise! is a collection of music that I would gladly put on the same shelf with the best Bob/Damian Marley tracks. As a bonus, it also has the original, non-pop version of King Without A Crown, which is musical bliss.If you only liked Matisyahu for \"Live at Stubbs\" or have a strong love for traditional dub and dancehall reggae then pick up this album, you will not be disappointed, it is worth every penny Amazon is charging. If you only like Matisyahu from his last couple albums, then this is probably not the music you are looking for.\n", "val": 0.00015507130592595786}
{"text": "This was the first album he put out, before \"Live At Stubbs\" and it is truly what I saw a magazine article call it; \"Hasidic Reggae\". It has that slower reggae sound, not as poppy or upbeat as his albums since \"Youth\" and a message of or even to G-d that you sometimes don't find in his newer stuff. This is in no ways a knock on his latest albums, but you can hear on \"Shake Off The Dust...\" he was trying to find a way to combine his beliefs into a music that was often fairly religious itself, that being the reggae style of Peter Tosh or Bob Marley.The version of \"King Without A Crown\" here is so much more soulful than the one on \"Youth\" and \"Chop'Em Down\", which he redid uptempo for \"No Place To Be\", is excellent.Be forewarned: If you don't like the older reggae sounds of Jimmy Cliff, Burning Spear, or Toots & The Maytals then you might not like this one.

Probably because the songs on it are a little different than the \"official\" recordings that came out later...or because there are different musicians on some of the tracks.  I honestly think he should have stayed with the musicians here.  The music blends very well.  It's less \"rock\" feel than the later works, and more melodic.

{"text": "5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.This song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?And don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check hereFREE MUSIC:From Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n", "val": 0.005947935860604048}

I started humming the Chris Tomlin song as I clicked the listen link and heard a very nice interpretation of it with a slower pace and sweet piano and string accompaniment.Just so you're not surprised, this is one track of a performance that carries through to the next in which Kimberly and Alberto continue with improvisations based on this song (it clips off abruptly on the end). Hmm... almost a sneaky way to get you to buy the album. At the time of this post Deeper Still is listed as $6.93 for 8 tracks of mp3.

{"text": "This song is a true jewel among Contempoary Christian songs and Kimberly Rivera's vocals are due the highest praise.  If God needs someone to do a special concert for him, Kimberly is His girl.  I first heard this song a few years ago at The Word of God Ministries in Central, WV, 2.5 miles east of Parkersburg, WV just off WV Rte. 47.  It was sung sung so exquisitely on machine by a gentleman with the Church's very small but God-strengthened choir of ladies.  The Church could sing along and did, in that typically sheepish manner we continue to sing from the old, dusty hymnals.  Flash forward a few years and minus the song.  I'm looking at some Blues albums and accidently come accross some freebies!  In the blues genre.  How awesome is that?  So, I'm downlloading these like crazy and figure, \"I'll edit these later.\"  Well, there was another pile of freebies which I thought were blues (of course) and began to download them as well until I got to see that there were, uh, a couple of, uh, well, Herr Mendelsohn's classical jams, but they ain't da blues.  Like what???  OK, so I'll edit those songs too.  Next morning, a rap about \"booty callin' or tappin'\" or something Dave Chappel might dig but it had to get drop-kicked back into to cyberspace.  Keep going.  There's some righteous blues jamming away.  Keepers for sure.  Then, \"How Great Is Our God\"...  The first version I heard was good enough yet the Church sorta mumbled it's way through it and that included this old guy.  It was just another \"early Sunday morning song\" designed to (hopefully) get the blood circulating a wee bit, and little more.  Nice song, but I wasn't really moved by it.  Here at home, the speakers are turned up, and what was once a nice, pleasant tune is suddenly transformed into a soul wrenching, righteously rousing, spirit shaking song, a gift from God Almighty so powerfully sung by Ms. Rivera that it shakes the very foundation of our Faith and Belief in Lord Jesus.  As a rule, I try not to show emotion.  Well, the house was empty, save for the cats and kittens, and here I am weeping profusely.  Maybe I was so strongly touched.  Perhaps the garbage within me had reached the \"Get rid of it\" stage.  Better still, I'd like to believe the Holy Spirit rocked my heart.  Whatever it was, I FaceBooked a dear friend in the Church's little choir and told her  about the song and asked her to at least listen to Kimberly's vesion and spread that gospel around to those who would listen.  So, I've just made a short story long, but there's a sincere purpose for that.  Everything has a reason.  I was looking for the blues and Kimberly Rivera slipped in unnoticed.  And the next morning there came a reminder that no matter what was going on, a God of Greatness would guide me through any and all travails.  All Praise His Holy Name!\n", "val": 0.0007728841155767441}

{"text": "First of all, Kimberly Rivera's voice is soaring and powerful and expressive, she really lets loose when she sings.  I haven't heard anyone exactly like her.  Her husband Alberto is excellent on the piano.  This is a very worshipful, inspiring rendition of this song.Their other songs are also highly recommended, they usually write their own material, whereas this is a cover of a popular worship song by Chris Tomlin.Just a note that this song cuts off at the end where it is supposed to flow seamlessly into the next song on the album.  I haven't bought the Deeper Still album yet but I may.  I have their The Collection and The Longing albums and they are both quite good.  I would describe them as free-flowing, meditative, \"new age\" sound worship.  Good for \"soaking\" prayer.  Some songs (such as Royalty) build to dramatic climaxes that give me goose bumps.\n", "val": 0.02946058288216591}

{"text": "He sings. He dances (must see the Richard Marx video: [...]. He blogs [...]. He serenades [...]. He tweets (@IamChrisMann ~[...]. Yes, Chris does it all. He brings back the day when artists showed appreciation towards their fans by allowing them to enter their world...completely. He is the MANN (how many times has he seen this written, lol).I first discovered Chris on Twitter. I saw numerous tweets coming from women from every direction. I clicked on his name, and the rest is history.Later in the month, Chris sent out a tweet for fans (because he's all about the fans) to send in words they associated with heartache. He turned the words into a self-directed, highly-viewed video covering Kanye West's \"Heartless\". I was lucky enough to make it in the video. If you haven't seen the creative genius of Chris, check it out here: [...]. Amazing!MANNfans have eagerly anticipated the EP. When the date was changed we all sighed, but hung in there because we knew that only greatness would come from this delay. And it did!When the Lights Fade is my favorite on this EP. Chris manages to captivate listeners as if they are attending a private session with him and his piano. The song is the perfect blend of chords, lyrics, and passion. If you're lucky, the lights will fade. And all that will be left is darkness and sweet dreams about Chris.The snippets on this site do not do the EP justice. You must purchase the EP to embrace this talent we call Chris Mann.Great job. Can't wait to hear more.\n", "val": 0.0008764805388636887}
{"text": "I was first introduced to the styles of Chris Mann when he was touring with the great, Idina Menzel. Hearing she was to have a opening act. I looked him up. Found his site which played some of his songs. Learned he is not only a singer, but song writer and writes most of his songs. He can play a few instruments. That's talent folks! Anyway, I really enjoyed listening to them. While at Idina's and Chris's show. I bought a one of the CD he had available. Which I really enjoy listening to. His combination of Pop and R&B with a blast of Soul. I instantly became one of the Mann's fan. Was excited when he finally issues some new music that I was able to buy. His EP is might be only 5 tracks. But they are some really great songs! The most stand out is his cover of Heartless, by Kanye West. Now before I start, I know some will probably say that he did this cause a Idol singer sang it as well. Well, First off, Chris did his cover longer before Kris Allen did his on Idol. Chris Mann even did a video for it. Which he had help from many of his Twitter followers. Anyway, Chris took the song and truly made it his own. Which is why many who have heard the different versions out there consider it one of the best.  The rest of the EP, The Weight of Your World, which he wrote a few months ago. Is another wonderful song. The original version he previewed earlier this year was a bit slower. But this version is the best.  One of the newer songs, If I Can't Make You Happy is just beautiful! This is so far my favorite track on the EP. The last two tracks, When The Lights Fade and 8 Story Walkup. I consider 2 of his classics. When The Lights Fade is a beautiful slow ballad. And 8 Story Walkup is is a song about the anticipation of being with the person you love. This song is a good make out or more song. In short, for $5 you can beat owning this EP of this star who is on the rise! LUBCHU!\n", "val": 0.02494976669549942}

{"text": "I have just returned from a two week cruise out of Buenos Aries that also visited Montevideo, Uruguay.  We spent several days in Buenos Aries before and after the cruise.  In that time we went to at least four different tango shows, in addition to the tango music & dancing (for the tourists) that takes place all over both cities.  I'm no music expert but I will say these performances all sound very typical of what we heard during our time in Argentina and Uruguay.  The tangos we saw had all sorts of tempo (speed) changes, and what at first sounded to me like off-key accordion chords.  But I can assure all... these are not off-key chords (after I heard them a few times my American ear learned to discern the subtleties).  So sit back and listen or get up and dance; but enjoy!\n", "val": 0.0005273729329928756}
{"text": "There definitely are several different styles of song in this album and some pieces are just beautiful.  I don't believe this is for the \"pop music\" minded but for a more mature ear that loves what world music offers.  You definitely get a sense of the Argentine influence in all the songs and all songs are sung in Spanish.  This is not an Argentine \"rock\" album.  Think of what you might hear when you walk along the old cafes at night and look for a place to drink a late night espresso or ... Most of the pieces are on the mellow side with a couple that are slightly more upbeat and modern.  If you like the Argentine flavor that you are familiar with in their tangos then you will appreciate this album as there is a bit in some and more than that in others.  Of all the free albums I consider this one amongst the very best in less than a handful of good ones. Great value!!!  Love it!  If it wasn't free, it would be worth buying.\n", "val": 0.017603674903512}
