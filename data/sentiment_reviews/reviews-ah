We oldies are not really into this modern MP3 stuff (whatever that is)Really disappointed.Apparently youngsters in GB are buying vynil now, you know those old fashioned round plastic things. :-) Seems they want something to hold, a physical item.

But, having played the youtube videos over a hundred times to note the improvements in style and finesse, I'm most impressed with Robbie's fiddle playing.  Robbie is headed to be the greatest fiddle player in bluegrass today and maybe, just maybe, forever.  Of the 3, his fiddling has exploded in the last 2 years.  His constant practice and his teacher's devotion really shine when it's time to turn the cameras off Jonny for some really traditional bluegrass fiddling.  American traditional bluegrass is in great hands.  Flatt and Scruggs would be very proud....Please, oh please, buy that guitar a nice acoustic pickup so we can hear it!....(c;]\n", "val": 0.03199107199907303}

These \"banjo boys\" ain't no \"sleepy man\" and deserve a spot in your listening/growing spectrum.

{"text": "Sep 2015 noticed sampler has a priceTrack 1. Colossus playing The Mountain That Rides. Old style in your face vocal over 70's style classic rock playing. Excellent opening track.Kong! play Martial Law. Semi metal vocal over solid band. Punk vibe.This Unholy War by Forte (acute accent over the e). Great guitar play nice speed drumming backing in your face vocal. Like it a lot.This Architect by The Vanisher. Opening old lady metal vocal over punchy band leads to clean vocal and great counter point singing over strong band. Peaceful vocal break that works as song brings us back. Love it.Down And Out by Blatant Disarray. Speedy excellent rock track. Active band complement chatty vocal. Great guitar riff and play this is a good song. Love it.Sound The Alarms (Teas'n and Pleas'n) by Killwhitneydead. Death growl opening vocal following brief movie clip opening. Great speed metal play, staccato drums, cool guitar kicks ass. Love it.Track 7. Obsession by Line Of Fire. Bland opening (especially after previous track) leading to very 80's tenor vocal, lightweight 80's style arena rock song. Actually a very good recreation of all that is 80's, Boston, Journey, Foreigner to name 3. Maybe I am in the mood for something meaner. Great song you may love it.The War Machine Embodiment by Inferi. Be careful what you wish for, deep and old lady metal singers battle over high speed thrash style band. Love it.Welcome To America by The Feds. Clean rock song opening leads to cool band playing with clear vocal singing youthful(read simple) lyrics. Excellent band keeps the singer on the right side of a great song. Like it.My Cross To Bare by Enemy Is Us. Lightweight opening metal vocal over strident band racing to finish. Keeps up the speed then hits death metal pause back to thrash. Like it.When Solar Winds Collide by Canvas Solaris. Best song and band name on the sampler. Jerky instrumental track which is apparently what they do. Semi metal sound with enough going on to listen to the whole 7 minute 33 sec track. Not bad, like it.Track 12. Reaction (Joey Sturgis Mix) by The Vanisher. 2nd track from this Melodic metal band. Retreating to 80's style arena band style (not that there is anything wrong w/that) clean vocal over busy and great sounding band that provide better than the 80's backing. Grows into better song with stronger vocal and louder band. Ends great love it....A Disoriented Blur by Vale of Pnath. Technical Death Metal is the official Genre. Superior harsh metal vocal driving with strong thrash sounding band that keeps up with it all. Busy direct sound excellent band very nice.Observer by Six Reasons To Kill. Death metal/Metalcore band sounding pretty good. Superior rapid play includes clean vocal after opening metal vocal that merges to great song, chorus and parallel vocals over great band. Love it.Still Waters by Iron Thrones. Opens to familiar metal sound however this 7 minute track mellows and regroups as the band strolls down the avenue of not a lot until at nearly 5 minutes vocal returns with grinding band laying down solid backing to death vocal over layers of play until unexpected old style fade out (is this a longer track?). Cool song, like it.Flames Of Creation (remix) Heartscarved. Defunct Metalcore band playing jousting metal-only vocals although superior band play creates openings to allow clean vocal to shine. Okay song.Final track is Habitual Murderer (Remix) by Azazel. All metal throughout this classic song. Great band behind true metal vocal. Nice.This free mp3 download from Tribunal Records through Amazon is mostly metal with a couple of great arena rock songs. There are a few different Genres however more important some great tracks.Who knows how long these Amazon free mp3 samplers are going to be available some are gone in a month others are still available from April.

So this should tell you something that I'm still willing to give this album 5 stars. It's because this was a magnificent album! I loved it from the moment it started the moment it ended and I can't get enough. The screams are generic (but whose arnt nowadays?) but the singing is...angelic. That's the only way to describe it. It's made even better when balanced out with gut-wrenching screams. I also really enjoy the slight touch of electronics that will have you thinking of I See Stars or Attack Attack, but no so out in front as that. In all honesty I'm not really sure what made this album stand out among so many other bands for me, but they did and I can't stop listening to them.

{"text": "Jamie's Elsewhere combines metalcore with keyboards and electronic sounds. And while they're not the first to do this, they do a good job of using those sounds to give their album some depth that you don't find in many bands. While the keyboards shine, the other instruments rarely seem to have their own turns to show off. Nothing's out-and-out bad, but there's a lot of sameness to some of the songs.That being said, I feel like there's a lot of potential here. The later songs ('Wolves' and 'Antithesis' in particular are standouts) that show flashes of brilliance, the keyboards still give them a dimension that other bands can't match, and there's 'The Prodigal'. Plenty of metal bands throw a self-indulgent soft track on their albums, but 'The Prodigal' has a haunting beauty to it that adds something special to the album.All in all, this album is worth a listen. It's not spectacular, not for me, at least, but it's quite good. And Jamie's Elsewhere is definitely worth your attention - their next release could have the potential to surprise a lot of people.\n", "val": 0.024437660351395607}
{"text": "There's a lot of screamo with punk-influenced vocals these days.  It makes it difficult to find a band that shines.  Jamies Elsewhere is one that does.The band isn't doing anything particularly unique here, and musically their songs are less interesting than a lot of other bands, but this particular album hits hard from the first song (Seasons), and only rarely takes a real breath (The Prodigal).There are some serious winners on this album, and not really any losers.  \"Seasons\" hits you right in the face at the beginning, and when it opens up into the clean chorus, it's goose-bump worthy.  \"Wolves\" is a tour de force of lyrical quality and has a truly awesome chorus.  \"One Foot in the Grave\" slows it down just a bit, and showcases some punk vocal roots, and when it hits, it hits.  And \"The Mapmaker\" eventually became my favorite song on the album.One of the things that sets this band apart from the fodder is that their lyrics are actually decent.  Maybe not ground-breaking or anything, but very good, especially when compared to so many other bands out there (and especially in this genre).The more I've listened to this album, the more I've fallen in love with it.  I truly hope their next is even better.  I've listened to the other stuff they have here on Amazon, and this is hands down their best work.  With a little more work on varying musical movements, they could easily create a screamo masterpiece.  Keep it up guys!\n", "val": 0.012476043775677681}

{"text": "The irony is that most 'supergroups' wind up being less than the sum total of their parts. In contrast, Medeski Martin & Wood's partnership with John Scofield is the definition of a highly successful collaboration. The setlist for this live collection is a balance of material off the group's two studio albums. \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/A-Go-Go/dp/B0000069NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Go Go</a>\" was a tight and disciplined enterprise while \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Out-Louder/dp/B000HKDEJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Out Louder</a>\" expanded the improvisational environment. Coming off the \"Out Louder\" tour, \"In Case The World Changes Its Mind\" pushes the jam even further. On stage, these guys were a pyroclastic powerhouse. In this respect, listeners that thought that \"A Go Go\" was perfect and \"Out Louder\" took things a bit too far may want to pass on this one. For the committed, there's much to offer. When you're dealing with material and musicians of this caliber, every song is a winner. In particular, 'Little Walter Rides Again' and 'A Go Go' are stand-outs. 'Southern Pacific' has a quirky groove that'll keep your head bobbin' for over eight minutes. The keyboard solo in 'Hunuman' sounds as if it were coming from a record being played backwards. 'What Now' rocks hard but 'Miles Behind' is a sonic blitzkrieg that'll leave you breathless. 'Hottentot' isn't just packed with mind-melting solos, it makes for an explosive closer to an electrifying experience. The two CDs contain a balance of twelve minute cookers and relaxed, reflective material. For years, I've been enthusiastically torrenting dozens of live MSMW shows. While there are some great audience recordings in circulation, there's nothing like a soundboard, official release. You've already got \"A Go Go\" and \"Out Louder,\" so why not make it a trilogy? This is the next logical progression. Don't wait for the world to change its mind; make up yours and get Medeski Scofield Martin & Wood live!\n", "val": 0.010587367229163647}
{"text": "I attended a show on this tour and actually remember being a bit underwhelmed.  Never-the-less, I passed that off as being just a bad day for the guys and purchased this CD package.  I am not sorry I did.First off, the concert is Medeski Martin and Wood with John Scofield.  They combination have put together 2 albums together in the past.  There is John Scofield's A Go Go and the MSMW disc, Out Louder.  I am a huge MMW fan, but always felt that A Go Go was a fantastic 5 star disc while Out Louder was more of a 3 star effort. The tour this particular live recording is from was from the tour was supporting Out Louder.  The thing that makes this album good is that pieces from A Go Go show up with the energy that went with that album (as opposed to the show I attended which felt like it was only Out louder material).The live performance here captures the energy of A Go Go, and you really see the four piece combo fly.  Most pieces are extended improv and jams off of themes and songs from the previously mentioned studio performances.  As much as I love MMW, it is John Scofield who shines on the recordings.  His performance stands up front and he is carrying the melodies and the improv for most of the recording; you could say he is the voice.  So what about MMW?  Well they are there, but I can't help but say they play more of a supporting role.  Even Scofield steps back, I'm left wanting more from John Medeski and crew.  I've heard MMW live at shows before, and the performance here seems a bit reserved.  I like the quality of MMW you hear in studio releases like the Radiolarians albums or Combustication, but that just isn't here.  That being said, John Scofield steps up and steals the show.  It is a solid 4 star set, and if I was a bigger Scofield fan, I'd probably rate it 5 stars.  I just can't help but knock it a star for MMW taking a supporting role.  Perhaps there is only so much space, but John Medeski and John Scofield are fantastic artists, and I can't help but want to hear the best of both artists.\n", "val": 0.01641685888171196}
{"text": "Back in about 2000 I started to listen to MMW. There was something about John Medeski's organ playing that just blew my mind. After becoming hooked on MMW, I decided to try and get anything that they were involved in. This included 1998's John Scofield album \"A Go Go\", which then introduced me to how awesome Scofield is, but thats for another review. This represents the first CD of their collaboration. The second being \"Out Louder\" which was more of a joint effort than \"A Go Go\" was. While \"Out Louder\" was good, I didn't think it was as good as \"A Go Go\", but it was solid none the less.As you might expect this CD contains songs from both CDs. What you get are great jams and interplay primarily between Medeski and Scofield. In the mean time, Chris Wood and Billy Martin are just tearing it up as the rock solid rhythm section, but they also get their chance to have some solos on a few songs.While I have seen both MMW and Scofield separately, I have not seen the two of them together. That being said, here is how I would compare this CD to those that have seen MMW live and may be a bit worried. There are sometimes when MMW jam on the stage where it is almost too avant garde and can be hard to listen to. In other words, it can be like watching a live version of \"The Dropper\". That is not the case here. Pretty much all of the songs have a solid groove established that they don't move too far away from. This to me is a good thing. In this way, it reminds me more of a Scofield concert.So here are some highlights for me on this CD. I think that \"Little Walter Rides Again\" has some great solos. This is one of the songs which Chris Wood has a solo and is just amazing. This song is followed up by Hanuman, which is another highlight to me. John Medeski is doing the same trick that he does on the CD version on his solos, where he is bending his keyboard notes during his solo to create an eerie feel to the song. John Scofield uses plenty of pitch bends to complement Medeski's solos. \"Tootie Ma is a Big Fine Thing\" is another playful song that is just executed well. Everyone gets a solo in this song too.All in all, there is not a bad song here. Although, there is one thing that I am disappointed in with the liner notes. The CD is apparently a compilation of songs from different performances from the tour. I wish they would have said where the songs were performed. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice. Another thing that I have noticed is that I don't think that John touches his clavinet during the entire performance. I noted this the last time that I saw them too. John, why not show the clavinet some love? That being said, he shows plenty of B3* love here, so it's not all bad.*technically, I think he plays the A100, but close enough\n", "val": 0.01567583531141281}

{"text": "I personally love this movie. Staring Hugh Jackman, who happens to be my favorite actor right now is wonderful in this move as he portrays a selfish, gambling, con-man who has no thoughts for anything or anyone other than Robot boxing. Then he gets the news that reunites him with his 11 year old son. The son also has an interest in Robot boxing and finds a Robot of his own to fight with. From there it is very reminiscent of the Rocky series of movies. Little boxing Robot overcomes all odds to fight in a match with the champ, knocks champ out but champ is saved by the bell. I won't give away the ending but i think you know what it is already. The father and son grow to really love and be proud of each other and in the final match Huge Jackman's character fulfill his dream by being a boxer himself. Because the little Robot can only finally fight through a shadow boxing mode so Jackman is really doing all the moves. There is a scene when Jackman is doing the moves for the little Robot to follow that is Kleenex worthy and really brings together all of the important character.

It is feminine, it's beautiful, it's captivating, it's inspiring, and I want it as a main theme for my superheroine The Silver Ninja.

Finally, Halloween is a treat that I won't mind listening to any time of the year, although a couple of tracks are pretty specific in the vocals. Another reviewer wondered what a day at the office must be like for Thomas Bergersen and Nick Phoenix. I concur, and have to think that the symphony and choral performers must have a blast making these recordings. Each track is a passionate, full on romp of epic musicality. John William's best work, on steroids and turned up to eleven. Keep it coming!A number of reviewers commented that they enjoyed listening as inspiration for their writing, and I agree. It's also terrific music for working around the house and fueling creative thinking. I love rocking Two Steps from Hell with a glass or three of wine while I cook.

{"text": "\"Epic\" is a word that is sadly grossly overused along the lines of profanity to where its meaning and impact wither away to a banality equal to a soggy french fry.  TSFH music IS epic, stirring classical music with qualities that can be quiet and surreal to thundering and making you want to pick up a battleaxe of your own and topple a army or two.  Archangel has a great cadence and build to it as you start up the album, and while some tracks are a little more engaging than others I found that their entirety makes for a more satisfying listening experience.  I find that it doesn't do so well as background music when i want to be in a focused or concentrated state of mind for intellectual projects (I find my battleaxe starts looking too sexy sitting in the corner).  But for playing video games or just listening its fantastic, and for working out one has to single out the more energetic tracks but they then more than deliver a solid motivation to get to that pumped/feral state where you feel like a werewolf finishing its transformation.\n", "val": 0.00013590195158030838}

{"text": "I recently discovered that Guild Wars 2, one of the best MMOs in history, has a feature built into it that allows you to play playlists of your own music in the game, overriding its own built-in soundtracks.  Given that the GW2 soundtrack is, in my opinion, rather unexciting (one of the few negative things I can say about the game), I started looking for replacement music, and wasn't quite sure where to start.Fortunately I quickly came across Dragon Rider, which led me to this album, and it didn't take very long for me to click the buy button on this album.  This much epic music is a steal at this price, and is working well to create much more exciting game play.  For GW2 players out there, just listen to Dragon Rider as you race across a battlefield to take down a boss, or perhaps Magic of Love while exploring the gorgeous cities, to get an idea of what I mean.Like anyone, I of course like some tracks less than others in this album, but overall, I'm quite pleased, and wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again.  The only real downside of this album is that the tracks are a bit short, so I run out of good music too fast.

I love big epic action film scores from the likes of Zimmer, Jablonsky, Tyler, Powell, etc, but had no clue what these albums were all about.  I was intrigued since they seemed to come up as other choices I might like in the epic score category.I saw that they they had great reviews and gave them a listen.  I was amazed!  I realized these were action scores, with no film!  Brilliant!Archangel has such a diverse compilation of epic styles that it never gets boring.  I find myself listening to it while I'm programming web sites and realizing I'm working at break neck speed because the music gets me fired up.One of the other primary things I love about this album is that the composer(s) focus on melody and not just musical sounds that would be good for an action movie.

{"text": "I tend to agree with Mathew Martin's two star review. At first I thought he was being a little too harsh hence my 3 out of 5 stars but he is absolutely correct.The music on this cd is dramatic but in a light way, lacking much impact which made their previous albums much sharper and Epic. Most of the music does not hit any deeper cores like Invincible did. It doesn't make it bad, but it is certainly not quality Epic Music as we are accustomed to in the genre. Much of this music would be right at home on a average movie soundtrack i.e. a little sleepy and quite a bit less grand/Epic than their previous efforts.I found the following three songs to be more Epic in quality for the genre we know and love: Everlasting, Archangel and Mercy In Darkness.Two Steps From Hell has previewed their new album on youtube called Two Steps From Heaven. After listening to all the samples on it I can safely say it isn't for me. However if you really dug Archangel then you will most likely dig Heaven so go check it out.For heavier, less \"Whimsyshire/Generic Soundtrack Music\" albums I recommend:Danny Cocke - From The Blue (Arguably my favorite)Two Steps From Hell - InvinciblePosition Music - Trailer Music Vol. 1The Best of Brand X Music (They need to make more volumes!)Audiomachine Chronicles (Make new volumes, arghh!)Also Cliff Lin - This Is War, as that album is more melodic while his other two are wholly rock/metal instrumental based.

Archangel is a fantastic, unparalleled set of music; I have found nothing else like it.  The choir is not heavy, though it is used quite a bit; on the contrary, voice is employed in this album to lift the strings and the percussion up to the heavens. What makes this album exceptional is the fact that every song is different and unique, and when played all through there is a definite story to the works.

{"text": "Firstly, let me fanboy squeal a bit: This is without a doubt the most epic musical composition I have ever listened to in my life. I kid you not when I say that I find myself walking faster and doing things with more purpose (even non-reading homework!) when this is playing in the background. I say that this album is worth it just for United We Stand - Divided We Fall. I could loop that song for HOURS and never get tired of it.That aside, this album is a fantastic set of short movie-trailer-like epic musical clips with themes ranging from agreement and unity (Magic of Love) to tense moments (Love & Loss) to realizations (Nero) to (my personal favorite) all-out action (United We Stand - Divided We Fall, Dragon Rider). The entire album flows amazingly well from track to track, and it can be easy to get lost in the album (which is far from a bad thing).Note that Two Steps From Hell is generally not driven by vocals. It's driven by epic composition, with some occasional singing voices in the background without any real lyrical composition. That's not saying that the voices in this album are *bad*, far from it; for the most part, voices aren't the main driving force behind the music, they instead decorate the composition beautifully. For example, United We Stand - Divided We Fall starts with a purely instrumental composition to start, and then female singing gets injected at just the right time.If you're on a budget and want to pick just one song, definitely get United We Stand - Divided We Fall for its pure, unadulterated epicness. The whole album is worth it though, so consider picking it up if you're a fan of \"awesome, epic\" music like Nightwish and Within Temptation. I personally like this album a lot more than&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Invincible/dp/B003MOHX8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Invincible</a>, Archangel's predecessor, but that's just me.

{"text": "I'm fairly fortunate that my kids (all three from ages 2 to almost 7) react strongly to music when it's on and that's generally whatever music I happen to be listening to which is pretty much never kids music. They particularly love Devin Townsend (a progressive metal musician) and the fun silly stomp of Blue Oyster Cult's \"Godzilla\" (of course they love the old Godzilla movies so that explains that.) None of this is very important to this album, other than noting that the quality of Tumble Bee has made it a household favorite along side very different types of music. I became acquainted as it were with Laura's music when I got a copy of The Decemberists \"The Crain Wife\" and quite liked the song she sang on, later a person at work happened to put on her \"Year of Meteors\" album in the van and I recognized her voice and went out and bought that album, and soon after most of her other work as well. So from a fan perspective this album is a light and relaxing little Americana folk album which is very much worth listening to. Not liking kids albums very much means the only tracks I was familiar with was the version of Froggy Went a' Courtin' (although not this version) and also All the Pretty Little Horses (which I knew from the Current 93 album of the same name. Incidentally if you like that song I quite prefer their version with David Tibet on vocals and also the version from the same album sung by the legend Nick Cave.) I quite enjoyed the album the first few times I listened to it, but the kids never paid it much mind (which was annoying as they were part of the reason I bought it) finally however they latched onto King Kong to the extent that they ask for it 3-4 times in a row. Besides that song, Little Lap Dog, Jack Can I Ride?, The Fox and Why of Why are constant favorites. Personally my favorite would be Soldier's Joy which happens to feature Colin Meloy of the afore mentioned Decemberists. Ultimately though this is a very good solid album of kids songs (the exception being Jamaica Farewell but I despise calypso music so you can take that as you will) and will please older fans and young kids alike.

I was thrilled when she released this album and bought it in anticipation of my son's birth, hoping it would be great. It's WONDERFUL. Since he was a newborn, my baby has loved these songs and pieces (with the exception of \"Jump Down Spin Around\", which I don't think is anybody's favorite). Playing this album would actually make him stop crying! I've listened to it over and over again, and still just love it. Best of all, because these are familiar folk tunes done in simple arrangements, they are very easy for anyone to sing along with. That's sort of the point when making songs for children, isn't it? :) And yet, in typical folk fashion, the album is also universally enjoyable for all ages. It's almost irresistibly engaging.

{"text": "Looking to take a bit of a break after a long tour and giving birth to her son, Portland-based singer-songwriter Laura Veirs decided to do a kids album. But instead of writing a dozen or more songs with kid-friendly themes, she decided to research kid-appropriate folk songs. The result is titled Tumble Bee: Laura Veirs Sings Folk Songs for Children -- a simple, direct title reflecting the simple, direct music inside.Many of the dozen songs (plus an instrumental reprise) on Tumble Bee will sound familiar to a long-term listener of music for kids or anyone who has more than a couple Smithsonian Folkways albums. (There is but one wholly original track, the title cut.) \"All the Pretty Little Horses,\" \"The Fox,\" \"King Kong Kitchie Kitchie Ki Me O\" -- these aren't songs that Veirs rescues from obscurity -- they're part of the (American) folk canon. Nor is \"Jump Down Spin Around,\" which Raffi nicked from Leadbelly (and recorded it as \"Pick a Bale o' Cotton\"). But that latter track -- which Veirs credits to Harry Belafonte (she was struck by his version of the track) -- is given an extra boost of energy on the new album, with a chorus of friends singing along in response to Veirs' words and adding a few stomps for emphasis.I'd call Tucker Martine's production of his wife's music as unfussy, designed to highlight Veirs' voice and the classic melodies -- why get in the way? Bela Fleck provides lovely (but not showy) banjo work on on \"King Kong Kitchie.\" Colin Meloy duets with Veirs on \"Soldier's Joy,\" making it sound a little bit like a track from some Bizarro Decemberists album where all the song have happy endings. And perhaps my favorite vocal turn is from Veirs herself, yodeling on \"Prairie Lullaby.\"Given the timeless nature of many of these songs, my typical suggestion of an age range is somewhat foolish, but it'll probably be more appreciated by kids ages 3 and up. (Though perhaps if you start younger, by the time they hit preschool they'll have all the lyrics to \"The Fox\" memorized.)Tumble Bee is a lovely album through and through. Fans of Elizabeth Mitchell's and Dan Zanes' family albums should be especially drawn to it, though this trawls narrower, folkier waters. But it also compares well to albums of Mitchell's Smithsonian Folkways predecessors like Pete Seeger and Leadbelly. Methinks Ruth Crawford Seeger, another one of Veirs' inspirations for the album, would be proud of it. It's a small gem, and while it's not actually a Folkways album, it's a kindred spirit to that tradition. Highly recommended.[Review originally appeared at&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Zooglobble/dp/B002KT1YPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Zooglobble</a>.]\n", "val": 0.01051255688071251}

{"text": "\"True sound of the underground\" is the 3rd full length studio album by Swedish Sleaze Metal/Hard rock band `Sister Sin' and one of the most characteristic cases of female fronted Sleaze metal.Despite the bold title of the release, one could claim that, in a sense, the new \"Sister Sin\" album is based on the sound of the underground hair metal; specifically the band has gone back to the original sleaze metal concept as defined by \"Motley Crue\" in the early 80s. Indeed every song on \"True sound of the underground\" references directly the first two iconic sleaze metal records of \"Crue\". So you can expect loud but sleazy guitar riffs topped by short yet effective leads, dark bass lines and totally `Tommy Lee'-like drumming (with the trademark locomotive tempos and characteristic fills). Evidently their brand of sleaze metal has a very American flavour on this new album, perhaps a result of being signed by US label `Victory Records', still whatever the reason, the approach is spot on and seems to work perfectly for them.What arguably deviates from this musical approach are Liv's vocals which instead of the high pitched tones and dark/romantic themes, are seriously aggressive (without going `brutal') and mostly mid range. In comparative terms the vocal approach is very very similar to that of \"Crashdiet\" (and their front man Simon Cruz). In terms of lyrical themes, the concept of the album evolves around youthfulness, defiance, social revolution and, of course, sleaze metal style.This album was quite as a surprise to me, as I did not expect `Sister Sin' to come up with such aggression in their new material. The preceding album was pretty rocking but not quite as focused or commanding as this new one. Therefore this time they go beyond loud and heavy rock'n roll to a more personality expressive style.Overall new \"Sister Sin\" album is an ideal choice for any fan on `Sleaze metal'. If you have bought the latest \"Ratt\", \"Crashdiet\" and \"Crazy Lixx\" albums then \"True sound of the underground\" is definitely next in line.\n", "val": 0.0011739622568711638}

For a one guitar band the guy pulls it all off and makes it sound more than full. The bassist fills it all in while the drummer stays simple but gives you all you want.

{"text": "Looks like this album was reissued under a different ASIN (old one ASIN: B003R4972S) and about 17 seconds shorter (34:03 vs 34:20)My original review: While some of the guitar work evokes Mick Mars, the overall sound is actually closer to the late 80's German heavy metal scene. This could almost be Warlock's Burning the Witches or True As Steel Pt II as the singer's voice is much closer to Doro than to Vince Neil. And the world could certainly use more of Doro's heirs filling the rocking/screaming niche in between the operatic beltings of the gothic end of things (Nightwish, ReVamp, etc) and the metal gruntings of The Agonist and Angela Gossow.Unrelenting metal assault with very effective use of hooks. And seriously, the compositions could be cribbed from echoes ricocheting around the clubs in Berlin and Dusseldorf from Accept, Scorps, and Warlock, . The back and forth between singer and backup chorus is balanced. The instruments and voices are well spread across the aural space. Get these songs. Play.

The remake of 24/7 is actually better than the original by UDO which you rarely ever can say that. Haven't heard any of Sister Sins previous stuff but its clear that with this album they wanted aggressive, rebellious in your face rock n roll and they delivered in spades.

{"text": "It's a strange scenario when within a short time of each other we had two female fronted hard rawk bands from Scandinavia sally forth with full length nuggets of road worn wisdom. I'm of course referencing the relatively short space of time betwixt the release of Vanity Inks `More Senseless Random Behaviour' and this album from Sister Sin.And to tell the truth both bands are playing much within the same ballpark. Both have produced solid second albums that stay very much within their remit of playing tight party rock sliding into more formal metallic realms at times. Both have somewhat charismatic female lead singers and both are quite obviously inspired at least in part by all the great party wattage from the harder end of the 80's musical spectrum. If one were to split hairs it has to be said that Sister sin are the more metallic, their sonic attack that touch harsher, the vocals of Liv being more barren sounding, more visceral and less in possession of self awareness of the inherent clichs within the lyrics, if that makes sense.All up this is a very full sounding album sonically, pretty much everything is louder than anything else. The whole album pretty much careens into one and many of the tunes themselves seem just about ready to collapse in a rather elegantly wasted manner. A little like the audio equivalent of the huge fender benders one sees on TV where 75 vehicles have all piled into each other - and yeah I'm meaning that as a compliment. A few studio trick are used here and there and the whole thing sounds crystal clear. Lyrics are not included in the booklet alas though it has to be said that they are probably not the strong point of this album. Then again as long as you attack the task at hand with the right amount of vigour then much can be forgiven. And the Udo Dirkschneider penned cover song.... hearing a female vocalist attack such a number was.... interesting.Eleven tracks, plenty of meat on the bone with little or no fat.

This came at the right time, it was one of the flavors that fit my musical appetite this time last year. \"Swing Thing\" became part of a playlist that I played to death. This track provided a counterbalance to the core of the playlist, things like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Beats-Antique/dp/B0014ZL0LS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Beats Antique</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Del-Reys/dp/B003BSAQ4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Del-Reys</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Parov-Stelar/dp/B000QWY9JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Parov Stelar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Oojami/dp/B000QLDANM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Oojami</a>.Listening to the samples across the album's tracks there are some interesting things going on, some enjoyable percussion, some modern incarnations of swing music. The obstacle for me was that the heavily produced sweetness of this track and the act's sound overall remind me of recordings like Roman Holliday's \"Stand By\", Oxo's \"Whirly Girl\" or even Wham. I'm hoping they take this foundation and on the next album roughen things up a bit, and lighten the heavy production on the vocals. I don't mean mimic the ragged harmonies of the Stones, but I'm looking forward to hearing development that expands beyond the automated sound.

This is one of my favorite albums by Ill Nino. Ill Nino was more successful a few years ago, than they are now. Times are changing digital has taken over album sales witch is kind of sad, because it's fun to go buy new album releases when they come out, but a lot of people stopped buying music.

This album is very well put together. Just about every song is at least an A- (apart from their bullet with butterfly wings cover). The choruses are very catchy, the riffs are groovey (peace out), it has everything you'd want from a great ill nio album. If that's not your thing, then you probably won't like it.

Shown as Progressive Metal, in your ears vocal over clean rocking band. Guitar licks and old style harmonic vocals very nice.Running For cover by Dimage. Another defunct band playing classic heavy rock song. Clean semi-soaring vocal over subdued rocking band. Nice, sounds dated.This Unholy War by Forte (acute accent over the e). Great high speed hard rock song with clean vocal over thrash & faster band. Nice.Up From Beneath by Uncle Slam. Defunct thrash metal band playing tight neat song w/punk roots. Great speed guitar play and vocal, 5 minute song rocks.Track 6. The Secret by Confessor. Nice Doom metal opening, shrill vocal over same play, nothing fancy.Down The Drain by Cyclone Temple. Defunct Trash Metal band, wordy vocal, band mostly in the background until their instrumental interlude which rocks, they sound great. Good song.Don't Talk About Love by Casanova. Sounding very familiar this song rocks as a 90's rock song which it is. Great strong & some screaming vocal over excellent band. Classic hard rock song, love it.Transmogrified by Solstice. Death Metal track that rocks. Speed play, guttural vocal, busy band & song. Song rules.Inspired Hatred by Elysium. Melodic Death Metal is the band's tag, this song rocks & slows sounding cutting edge and then jaded in the same song. Thrash metal roots, repeated riffs, soaring guitar, & then more. I love it then I love it less, 6 minutes. Like it.Dementia By Design from Forte (same e). Brilliant speed metal (or Thrash Metal) song, soaring vocal, fast guitar playing more, slows to breath then zooms. Love it.Paradise by Line of Fire. Soaring vocal, guitar and rocking band bring to mind Journey w/o Mr Perry taking all the limelight. Excellent song, superior vocal, great band.Resurrected by Dominance. Reminds me of early Atari Teenage Riot. Chatty vocal and spoken words that never sound good after a few plays. Nevertheless, classic Thrash metal play, 5 minutes.World War Three (Crack Party Weekend). Similar to previous track, intense high speed play (very ATR like) political lyrics, rocking band, drums & noise.Reunion by Widow. Great old style hard rock song, Iron Maiden/Judas Priest-like, cool guitar rocking song, great vocals love it.Victimize by Fly Machine. Progressive Metal song that stumbles along, jerky play and uneven vocal, you may love it.Final track Witches & Warlocks by Oracle. Long gone heavy metal band playing classic metal track. Clean vocal above strong pounding band. Heavy and safe.Released in October 2011, nudged into and immediately dropped out of the Amazon Top 100 Free mp3 downloads this week, this sampler from Divebomb Records hard rocks.Divebomb Records is the division of Tribunal Records used to reissue old material.

We have just started trying these different types of sleep sounds so my review comes from a beginner's perspective. So far we have tried ocean waves, mountain streams, African nights and now this \"Autumn Forest\". Like the other reviewer, there is not really anything in this sound loop that especially makes it \"feel\" like fall. That being said, I could still be happy with it, if not for the stupid cat meowing. There are no meowing cats in a forest. The cat meowing spoils the whole thing for us. I wish I could get my money back because we can't use this for the purpose which we intended it and I have no use for it any other time. The meowing cat ruins it.

{"text": "Ok, first of all we are big Shanghai Restoration Project and David Liang fans, having purchased most of the SRP catalog in digital format over the years. When we saw this new CD announced we actually pre-ordered the physical disc from Amazon for our newborn son to not have to worry about streaming and digital files for the nursery. My wife is Chinese and she immediately recognized all of the songs that are on the disc from her own childhood in China, and they are well produced by David Liang with his signature mash-up sort of style if you can call it that? Think a modern, electronic-influenced take on classic Chinese children's songs. The fact that they are all sung by a children's choir make them great to just have playing in the background around the house and the musical aesthetics are pleasing to us adults who may get bored hearing children's music over and over and over again (welcome to parenthood...).  We have some other Chinese children's music but as I said, this is probably the only one I can listen to and not get bored of. The style may not be for everyone as you need to appreciate the remix culture and electronic music, but definitely give the sample tracks a listen and I'm sure you will love them.\n", "val": 0.023226583376526833}

This is the best Country Project, The Oaks Have come out with, since \"Voices\", in 1999!!!!The CD'S opener, \"What'cha Gonna Do\", gives The Oaks, and edge, like they've never had before.  Richard Sterban's Boomy-Bass, is the reason, that this song is so catchy.  It's very easy to sing along with!!!!\"True Heart\", an older hit, was revived, for this recording.  It has the same rockin' feel, with a different twist.  I LOVE IT!!!!!\"Before I Die\", with William Lee Golden, singing the lead, is by far his best lead, ever.  Has the makings of a promising ORB single.  It's a keeper, for sure.\"No Matter How High\", another one of the older hits, was also revived for this project, with Duane Allen, putting his smooth vocals, on the the lead.  A different but Countrified version, with the addition of steel guitar, giving the song a newer sound.....The best recording of this song!!!!\"The Shade\", another new song, on the project....has Duane Allen putting his smooth vocals on the lead.  Has an edge to it, like nothing else they've ever done, before.  It is easy to see, why this song was chosen for this special project.  A great song, indeed!!!\"Elvira\", as special re-recording of the Oaks' 1981 Smash, was done for this project, as the song celebrates 30 years....Re-energized with the absence of the french horns, as heard on the original recording, the song has a more rockier, sound, and is very much like the version, that is performed in ORB Concerts, through the years.  Take a listen....it's AWESOME!!!!!\"Louisiana Red Dirt Highway\", orginally recorded by William Lee Golden, as a solo, for this project, it became a group effort.  Has the same feel, as the original, but now has all 4 Oaks collaborating, and harmonizing on the chorus.  One of the project's entertaining numbers.  Very cool!!!!\"Beyond Those Years\", originally recorded with the late Singin' Steve Sanders, on lead vocals,  The song was revived for this project, with a newer sound, and arrangement.  Joe Bonsall, now sings lead, with such emotion....it gives the song a newer edge.  A highlighted moment for the project, for sure.\"Wish You Could've Been There\", another new song, on the project....giving Duane Allen, some emotional vocals, it has the makings of an ORB classic.  I would have a box of klennex, ready when listening to this one.\"Lucky Moon\", another older hit, orginally recorded with the late Singin' Steve Sanders, on lead vocals.....This version, has a little more \"PEP\", with Richard Sterban, now singing lead.  It has a newer sound, with a little more electric guitar, and not as much fiddle, it is a very rockier-sounding version, revived, with the same ORB magic....Very cool!!!!!\"Sacrifice For Me\", written by Joe Bonsall, this song closes out the project, an emotional look at our Country's servicemen, and the sacrifices they paid, to keep all of us, safe, and free.  Another song, that you'd have to have a box of kleenex, nearby, when listening to it.  The best Joe Bonsall emotional lead vocal, ever.In conclusion,  \"It's Only Natural\", has brought new life to a familiar sound.  7 revived recordings of older hits, and 5 new songs, make this a must-have project, for any ORB fan!!!  The Oak Ridge Boys, have once again, given all of us something to be proud of.  A recording to last a life time.  These songs are the acorns, which tell a story, and give the listener, an idea, of what The Oak Ridge Boys, are all about.  I am proud to call Joe Bonsall, Duane Allen, William Lee Golden, & Richard Sterban, friends.  They are true to life entertainers, and ambassadors for america.  Listen to this project, and you'll hear why.  I highly recommend it!!!!\n", "val": 0.034968845546245575}
{"text": "The Oak Ridge Boys have been around for years and I've been a big fan of theirs. If country music ran an \"oldies\" show - like rock and roll acts - the ORB's would certainly be on the bill, singing their multitude of hits and throwing in some new songs too. I liken them to the Gatlin Brothers - who I had the chance to see recently and whose new CD I also reviewed.This CD - marketed to be sold at Cracker Barrel restaurants - is not unlike their previous albums and includes new songs (mostly about growing old or remembering when you were younger) as well as old. Their mega-hit \"Elvira\" is here. (It's having it's 30th anniversary!).While I really liked this album, two tracks brought my rating down a notch. \"Beyond Those Years\" has a great instrumental intro, and the lead vocal is great, but the mix seems off with the lead vocal sounding like he is standing back from the microphone. And the lead on \"Lucky Moon\" just seemed a bit \"off\" for me.But the CD still gets four stars from me because these guys are true \"old country\" legends and, like the Gatlins and Riders in the Sky, they keep on entertaining fans with great music - mixing the old standards with some new tunes and playing their instruments at the top of their game.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\"\n", "val": 0.008323452435433865}

So I was thrilled to listen to \"The Secret Bees of Ninth\" and see more of the Murphy I loved on new tracks like \"Gaslit\" and \"Rose Hunter\". The new tracks, along with an extended \"Secret Silk Society\" and the latest single off \"Ninth\" (Seesaw Sway) create a strong reminder of why Murphy has endured as an artist. I think \"The Secret Bees\" should be seen as a completion of, rather than a companion to, \"Ninth.\" Considering the fact that you can (digitally) purchase both the album and the EP on Amazon for less than ten bucks, I say get both and consider it as a whole.

{"text": "Fierce is just about the only word I can come up with so bowled over have I been by listening to this new disc from Madama DiDonato.It opens like gangbusters with the spectacular rondo \"D'amore al dolce impero\" from Armida - a very impressive way to open this recital, every  minute of which is thrillingly AND gorgeously sung.  DiDonato hurls her voice through coloratura that will practically make your head spin - showing off a more dazzling range than one usually encounters in a mezzo.  Then again, she seems to be almost channeling Colbran.The Dona del lago selections remind me of another mezzo I loved in this music, the young von Stade, with DiDonato possibly earning the laurel wreath here.  Of course 35 years ago when Flicka was singing this music Rossini scholarship and performance standards were not quite what they are now, and she was singing it live (in Dallas) with an opera house orchestra in that old barn and recorded by pirates.  In 2009 Ms. DiDonato has it considerably better - but none of that would matter if she couldn't sing this stuff and sing it she does - most impressively - and with high notes, grupetti, wild and fierce (there's that word again) variations that pose not a single problem.  Her upward scale work in the finale is just nuts!Putting away the fireworks for a minute, DiDonato summons up ravishing tone and pours her heart into Maometto II's \"Giusto ciel in tal periglio\" - I've heard many versions of this aria, and DiDonato virtually matches the tragic pathos that Sills brought to this in her La Scala debut, and with a similar quality that's both sunny and sad.  The entrance of the chorus - then her decorated line is gorgeous (and I didn't even miss the impossible high note (D#?) Sills tacks in that makes me swoon).  I DO miss that Maometto doesn't include the gorgeous cabaletta that follows (which Sills is ridiculously great in).It's fun to hear the \"e cento trappole prima di cedere\" music from \"Una voca poca fa\" pop up in the middle of Elisabetta regina d'Inghilterra's \"Quanto  grato all'alma mia\" (or was it vice versa?)  and Joyce and Co. make it soar.It's also great to hear a nice chunk of Otello (aided beautifully by Lawrence Brownlee) making me wish this opera were more popular than it ever got to become (thanks a lot, Verdi!).  I'm thinking SOMEONE needs to mount a production of this for these two.  Talk about a hit!Eduardo Muller leads the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia forces in glorious, full blooded readings the orchestra playing as if to the manner born and the choristers, clearly inspired sing with the same infectious love for Rossini as their golden tressed collaborator.I won't go into detail of every number here (you're welcome!) but the entire disc is so well conceived, so lovingly put together, the singer's phrasing, breath control and sense of drama is all so damned exciting it moves right to the top of this year's \"favorites\" pile!\n", "val": 0.017927328124642372}

Here, relying primarily on her voice and musicianship, she triumphs.  Make no mistake, there's plenty of personality present on this disc, but her singing is the glory of it.  The trills, runs, cadenzas and other coloratura feats are not merely managed, they are thrilling, delightful and amazing, all those things that real coloratura singing should be.  She is alive to words in a way which many \"bel canto\" singers simply are not, and invested in the meaning of every aria.  This is beautiful and exciting singing.The sound is superb, the conducting, playing and choral singing are dandy.  I'll go out on a limb and say this has become a desert island disc for me.  DiDonato's version of the killing ARMIDA variations is simply the best I've ever heard, and she is splendid in the blazing finale of that opera too.  (The Met should take note!)

Keep in mind - this isn't some chirpy soubrette-soprano, oh no.  DiDonato has gorgeous, rich mezzo, although she's not a contralto of Ewa Podles's mold.  The selections that imressed me the most, however, were from Otello.  This is when \"taking a break\" from trills and reprises, DiDonato is free to convey the anquish and passion of the doomed heroine, the prayer is the most touching moment of the whole album.  Universal praise has been heaped on DiDonato's technical proficiency, and justly so, therefore I won't dwell on it for this short review. An excerpt from Armida would just do the trick. But I would like to convey to you a sense of urgency - this is the modern-day opera singer of great magnitude, as if she'd stepped from the proverbial golden-age of this very-much-alive art.

{"text": "I expect that this review will attract opprobrium and corresponding negative votes, but I seriously wonder if any of the preceding ecstatic reviews are by listeners who are really familiar with some of the best recorded Rossini singing over the last thirty or so years. I dread turning into one of those old bores who intone, \"Ah, but you should have heard [insert any singer of the \"old school\"]\" but there is no way that Joyce DiDonato measures up to some of her predecessors. Technically, she is excellent, with a fine even range, a passable trill and admirable agility, but interpretatively she is virtually devoid of personality - and the top of the voice is more than a mite tremulous at times. I have for some time been sitting on the fence regarding her real worth, but have never been struck by any special individuality of timbre. I thought that this recital might settle for the matter for me - and indeed it has; I am moderately impressed but she in no wise eclipses the likes of Horne, Von Stade or Podles.Let's start with emotional heart of the recital: the extended extract from Act 3 of that neglected gem \"Otello\". I made a point of playing in succession DiDonato and then Von Stade in the same music and asking my wife to listen too. She immediately confirmed what I first thought: DiDonato makes an impressive noise, but she sounds as if she has little idea of what she is singing about and manages to conjure virtually none of the plangency and tenderness so abundant in Von Stade's Desdemona, recorded in Lopez Cobos's complete set in 1978. True, Von Stade needs more breath and occasionally breaks a phrase where DiDonato sings through it, but emotionally and interpretatively she leaves DiDonato in the dust - not to mention sheer beauty of sound. It's a great pleasure to hear Lawrence Brownlee's mellifluous tenor as the distant gondolier (recorded too close) in the haunting snippet from Dante, but the comprimario soprano who sings Emilia is blowsy and wobbly; poor compared with Nucci Condo in the older recording. Similarly, DiDonato cannot approach the verve and bravura of either Horne or Podles in the more martial arias. I do not expect her, as a mezzo, to have their vocal heft but the comparisons are revealing and I find her lacking even in direct competition with more similar voices such as those belonging to Von Stade or Bartoli. Indeed, she often sounds very like the latter without her mannerisms - but also without her personality.I suppose if you have no particular attachment to these older singers and prefer a lighter, less overt approach to Rossini, DiDonato will be fine, but I suspect that Colbran herself compensated for a declining voice with a great deal more art and maturity of expression than DiDonato is capable of here. She is a relatively young singer and clearly a fine one, but I wonder whether people's eagerness to hail a new star has warped their judgement; she really is not the Rossinian dream of the more effusive reviews and her lack of identification with the texts means that she has not made the transition from comedienne to the serious roles completely successfully. I hesitated to give this disc four stars and was inclined to award three, but admiration for her accomplishment prompted a more generous verdict.PS Am I the only one faintly embarrassed for the singer when the cover photo depicts her in full pouting Playgirl pose with plunging cleavage on display? It's not very dignified when a serious artist lets herself be presented thus.\n", "val": 8.859339141054079e-05}

Her range is impeccable, featuring secure low register, a confident mid-range and voluminous high notes. Additionally, Joyce makes technically tricky passages sound effortless. If you're a long time fan of Gioacchino Rossini and have yet to listen to any of Joyce DiDonato's Rossini recordings, this is the album you must to pick up.\n", "val": 0.03352346271276474}
{"text": "May be I am 'slow'; but I only discovered Ms. DiDonato these couple of years, and to me, this is probably the greatest vocal discovery since 2000.This is a true all-round singer - great timbre, rock-solid technique, wonderful musicality, high intelligence.Almost everything she sings are immaculate, but in this album she concentrates on Rossini.I must confess that I am not a great Rossinian fan.  Other great Rossinian singers that I found impressive include Kasarova and Florez.  But these two do not manage to rouse my interest in this composer to the extent Ms. DiDonato does here.If I found some other great Rossinians lacking some times in character, Ms. DiDonato never makes me wonder what character(s) she has been portraying. In a single-composer album like this, it is of immense importance to be able to state the differences, and DiDonato does admirably.I would only say that she not only makes me love Rossini's works, but makes me want to listen to the entire operas from which the tracks here are being extracted. This seldom happens in an album of excerpts like this one, and this is evidently the result of highly successful vocal acting and portrayal.Without a single doubt, this artist will be the one to hold up the operatic banner in the decade to come and more.\n", "val": 0.030206788331270218}

While I wish there were more songs, the songs that are there are superb, ranging from well-known tunes (Drift Away & Everything) to original songs (!). By virtue of these impressive originals, this group takes the leap from the \"cover band\" approach to acapella to real artistry. By limiting their covers, they unhinge themselves from other groups, and this only enhances their unique flavor. Their strengths are their clear tone and excellent blend, supported by an effortless timbre that only comes with \"unpractice\".Can't wait for the second album! Hopefully this album will give them the lift they need. Can't get their song \"Most of It\" out of my head. Keep hearing that major seventh in the melody....Edit: I have decided to remove a portion of my review that discussed bass issues on the track \"Everything\".

I've heard a great jazz musician from New York say that the best starting point for a recording is a great performance in a great acoustic space.  I've had the opportunity to listen to great performances in several great spaces including Carnegie Hall, Orchestra Hall Chicago, Seiji Ozawa Hall, and the Concertgebouw Amsterdam; and the Gene and Shelley Enlow Recital Hall, the site for this recording, ranks as a very special place for great acoustics.  I listened to the performance live, and I listened to the recording session through Sennheiser HD600 headphones (full disclosure: I'm credited with assisting with the audio engineering).

{"text": "Gloria Estefan is someone whose always peaked my interest musically. Having latin ancestory myself (in my case Puerto Rican) it wasn't hard to find something very compulsive in \"Dr. Beat\",\"Conga\" and \"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\". One of the key things about her and her husband/manager Emilio is their ability to maintain the cuban percussive rhythms of their own cultural musical stylings with a production style that can appeal to a number of generations of youth culture. In the 80's it was freestyle. In the 90's it was Hi NRG techno/dance. And now it's all being channeled through various dance/hip-hop varients.  And Gloria was wise to bring in Pharrell Williams as the producer,songwriter and lyricist for this album. Pharrell is very well suited to the intelligent collaborative musical process she prefers. He also is exactly what the doctor ordered in terms of bringing the two musical eras she and Emilio have encompassed into focus by bringing new flavors to the overall music. Having only just heard about this albums existance the other day, I was very excited to finally locate it today and get a chance to hear this album-from what I saw on a recent PBS interview Gloria herself is so proud of. And upon hearing it I can see why.  Considering how much time Estefan spend on producing heavily stylized ballads over the years this album will likely amaze everyone. Now a woman in her 50's this album takes a complete about face from anything that's remotely adult contemporary. It's an uptempo album,full of strong songs with strong rhythms and embracing a sound that seemlessly blends contemporary inspired electronics with a hot cuban salsa sound filled with horns,percussion and breaks. That contemporary electronic style,by the way is via Pharrell and therefore heavily influenced by 80's techno freestyle dance music. So the title song,with it's old school hip-hop beats as well as the high octane,ultra fast dance numbers \"I Can't Believe\",\"Heat\" and the hyper cumpulsive \"Wepa\"-the latter of which is the big (and a little unlikely) hit from this album. It's not exactly a commercial type of dance number for this day and age but is a perfect example of her new concept. From \"Say Ay\",\"So Good\",\"Right Away\" and \"Make Me Say Yes\" it's really just a pretty straight ahead cuban band flavor. \"Time Is Ticking\" is the closest thing to a ballad,or appears to be because it's somewhat less instrumentally thick but the point is made.  A reprise of the title song subtitled \"Steps Out\" again throws it all together,from cuban big band horns to \"retro neauvo\" freestyle. From \"Hotel Nactional\" through the bonus tracks of \"Wepa\" and \"Let's Get Loud\"...it's right back at the start: high octane modernized big band cuban freestyle with somewhat more of the modern touch.  Even \"On\" will surprise you with it's hard rocking guitar solo at the end. There will be some who might think of this album as an attempt to \"reach the kids\" as they say. But honestly so what if it is? Most generations have their share of dance music that's very shallow. Both in terms of melody and lyrics,this album celebrates the flavors that come together to make this kind of music possible and help the listener to experience the environments that might compell ones feet to move. The rhythms,beats and effects all hold a strong ethnic and cultural identification from Estefan. She's always kept it there in whatever she does. And that's why I still have the utmost respect for her artistry and approach to music. It's an album of music that is contemporary on one end but has the effect of being completely ageless on another level. That's what Gloria has been about all along. And if this is any indication she hasn't skipped a beat on that end.\n", "val": 0.031808435916900635}

Al llegar a casa busque y finalmente encontre esa magnifica colaboracion entre un grupazo y un tremenedo vocalista. Va recomendado por su integridad a lo romantico y su paso agradable bailable.\n", "val": 8.133857772918418e-05}
{"text": "Picked this up for free(!) and added it to my workout list on my MP3 player, and it has become one of my favorites. There's a steady beat going on that keeps you moving FAST. The tune is easy to follow or song along with, so don't worry about the beat suddenly changing, slowing up, or taking off in another direction. There's a couple of spots where the drums stop for a few seconds, but the song keeps the beat going and you will, too.The singer has a nice voice and puts alot of energy into the song. Certainly worth a listen!\n", "val": 0.05141982436180115}

But for his latest song, It Will Rain, the lead single from the Twilight movie: Breaking Dawn. The song isn't bad from Bruno, yet I had heard better epic songs. Still, unlike Lady Gaga or Beyonce', Bruno has some really nice songs. It is a good listen to for any fan of die hard Bruno Mars fan, but yet it isn't as good as Just The Way You Are was when it came out. I do hope when Bruno's second album comes out there can be more to hear than just raining from Twilight.Song: B-\n", "val": 0.007411176338791847}

Not only is he FINE but he is extremely talented since he sings, writes and produces most of his music.  He is truly a quadruple threat - he can sing, dance, write and act.  What he needs is a show in Vegas!  Cannot wait for him to come to my side of the country so I can see him up close and personal.  He is good on vinyl and even better in person.

{"text": "In this age of global struggle for peace and sustainable modes of living for all, the unwary may well greet \"Night Attack\" with a smile or at least a brief nod of affirmation. One cannot help but come to this album primed with hope: Have progressives committed to achieving a just and equitable society by any means necessary finally found a popular artist willing to challenge the oppressive cultural systems that perpetuate the hegemonic discourse of violence and ownership that brutalizes all of humanity? The title coyly suggests that Mr. Brushwood and Mr. Young have indeed joined arms in our struggle by challenging the overbearing constructs of \"artist\", \"listener\" and even the fictive, pernicious notion of \"album\". Clearly Mr. Brushwood and Mr. Young are asking us to embark on a de-centered, collaborative relationship exploring the pressing question \"What Does T.I.B. mean?\"Yet it soon revealed that the title is itself the grimmest of jokes, the twenty-first century equivalent of \"Arbeit Macht Frei\". Taking stock of Brushwood and Young's intellectual forebears, one can only conclude that they are most indebted to Joseph Goebbels, for what is this album if not the embodiment of \"The Big Lie\"? Posing as the avatar of innocence, the album is in fact a handbook for global domination. In the tracks purporting to represent the audio messages of \"family\" to the \"husband\", we find so brazen a message for imperialistic adventure that Cecil Rhodes, if he could, would blush. With tracks depicting a \"war hero\" and \"laser tag\", Brushwood and Young take the intellectual superstructure of global oppression to heights unseen since the dazzling, castrating cathedrals of medieval times. Opiate of the masses, indeed! Contrary to the claims of others insufficiently grounded in critical, revolutionary thinking, \"Hitler\" and \"Uncle Bilbo\" are in fact nothing more than representations of those false leaders who pretend to represent the interests of the people, but are in truth coopted by the very power system they pretend to assail and which uses these pawns to sow doubt and confusion in the minds of workers struggling to make a living in this poisonous system of radical redistribution of wealth from the people to the plutocrats. Yet what is most shocking is that Brushwood and Young do this not to raise revolutionary consciousness but rather to dull the minds of the oppressed and in this regard their work is best analogized to alcohol. For those interested in pursuing this avenue further, I highly recommend \"How to Read Donald Duck: Imperialist Ideology in the Disney Comic\" by Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart.As for Mr. Brushwood, Mr. Young, and their ilk, take heed. When the revolution comes, all that is solid will indeed melt in the air! In closing, I must stress that this review pertains only to the downloadable MP3 edition.\n", "val": 0.0002643742482177913}

That's just math. In fact, I tried to buy it again from the MP3 Store, but Amazon said no.  WTF Amazon? First you try to overcharge for the album, and then you try to limit how much of the, the awesome we can consume.You might be asking why I enjoyed this album.  Well, hypothetical man or woman, I'm glad you asked.  I think that the best part of this album is how educational it is.  For example, did you know that if you are not satisfied with your DVD copy of It's A Wonderful Reich, all you have to do is play a little \"Mexican Hat Dance\" and, bam, problem zolved?  You just saved $25 dollars that you would have wasted on the Blu-ray.  That's $4 if you've already adopted the steak standard, which, as you will learn, you should.It also answers some of life's fundamental questions:<>How much should I spend on a TIB show?<>How much meth is in that value meal, Judy?<>What should I wear to a sacrificial rock show?<>How should I raise my child?<>How do I install the newest version of iOS on the day that it's released?<>How do comediennes get work?<>Should I sleep in cotton or a G-string?<>How can I improve my self-esteem with just a bike and an iPhone?<>What is the best way to play laser tag?So, the question you should be asking yourself is not \"Should I buy Night Attack?\"  Rather, it's \"How many copies of Night Attack should I buy?\" I can't tell you the right number (but Amazon sure as hell will try); it simply depends on how much of the, the awesome you need in your life. <>\n", "val": 9.1666923253797e-05}

{"text": "since it took me until this exact moment ,albiet the first week in january,in my opinion,Michael Castaldos Christmas release,Extraqvergine is a sacred soulful,just listen to it and find yourself cd,where Michael sings on a high vibrational level,a level equal to the greatest good in a human soul,and through his sacred spiritually enriching sounds,which emenate from the soul itself of the singer,in this case Michael Castaldo. I consider this particular work excellent for all occasions,but for me,catching the breeze and listening to the cd alone not only is pleasant listening,it can bring you to that same loving ,soulful vibrational level. Highly Recommend,in fact i endorse all Michaels works,as we play lots of Michael on our Sunday Italian Show,\"Carosello Italiano\".Also another thing about Michael in case you don't know him,heres an artist who is friendly,easy going,and very detail and goal oriented. In my book,Michael and Extravergine will always be held in the highest regard,the music can also be used for yoga,meditation,anything at all to do with getting in touch with your own spirit,,BAM five stars. sincerely,joe costa,producer,carosello italiano,sundays,10-2@watr.com\n", "val": 0.031070807948708534}

Although he was born in Calabria Italy his family moved to Canada when he was 3 years old,but I think he is also a good American. He speaks flawless English and I love his Italian dialect. He is a family person and you can tell by his singing. You feel as if he is in a family group and he is singing too themHis voice comes out mellow and effortlessy but he changes style and you hear the operatic notes come out sweetly.Others have mentioned the song titles but one pleases me and I chuckle when I hear the extra notes (yah)  You will be happy listening to Extravergene ( I think of oil) but the music is like honey.Thank you Mike for all your hard work on this record and I wish it sells a million cause it is worth it.

{"text": "I was really looking forward to getting `Black Veil brides'-\"We stitch these wounds\". I am reviewing this release strictly from a hair/sleaze metal-melodic hard rock perspective (I am not at all familiar with Metalcore and the modern subgenres in general).Inevitably their image precedes them, having enjoyed almost mainstream success (for a metal band) with their video clips while also making effective use of the web based mediums of communication. With a star banner (bringing directly to mind the `Shout at the devil' front cover), a front man called Andy Six (like Nikki Sixx) and the overall make up/big hair-sleaze metal image, the `Motley Crue' influence is as evident as it has ever been on a band.Needless to say, I wanted so hard for `We Stitch the wounds' to be a heavy- rocking album and `Black Veil Brides' clearly lived up to that expectation. It is very true that a band is primarily judged on account of their vocals and lyrical themes; still I have to start from the guitars as this is the instrument that left the biggest impression on me regarding \"BVB\".The album is a true testament to melodic guitar playing as it is filled with endless amount of melodic line guitar lines (guitarists Jake Pitts and Jinxx deserve congratulations) while also demonstrating thick rhythm parts and interesting riffs. In addition the rhythm section is solid: bass player Ashley Purdy is clearly a very experienced-in the particular genre- bass player, while drummer Sandra Alvaregna is far from the stereotypical female drummer making incredibly good use of double bass drums, while demonstrating a variety of rhythm patterns throughout the album. Finally bandleader Andy Six also lays his vocals in a very melodic fashion matching perfectly the instrumental melodies (thankfully there are not as many growl/brutal vocals on their recordings). Six wisely allows his band to shine throughout this debut, instead of reducing them to a musical vehicle for his vocals.Favorite songs include: `Beautiful remains', `Knives and pens', `Children surrender' and `Perfect weapon'.I strongly feel that `We stitch these wounds' is primarily a guitar oriented album while also demonstrating significant talent on the vocal and drum part. Musically based on a very old school instrumental formation, guitar-guitar-drums-bass-vocals and very little evidence of keyboards, the `Black Veil Brides' debut should be a very appealing sound to fans of Sleaze metal, melodic metal, and hard rock.\n", "val": 0.004343838896602392}
{"text": "What do the Black Veil Brides mean to me? They are an EPIC band that makes excellent-quality music with their Indie label. For all of my life, all that I had ever heard was mainstream music. If I had heard any Indie music, I usually didn't think that it was all that good. It wasn't until too long ago that I'd heard some of the BVB's music. As an up-and-coming band, hearing their great quality was a breath of fresh air to my music collection. But, when I learned that were an Indie band, I was BLOWN AWAY!The BVBs seem like a cross between My Chemical Romance, Bullet for My Valentine and HIM. They have an interesting way of integrating the metal/screamo aspect of their music with smooth vocals.This band is TOO GOOD TO PASS UP! For those of you who question whether or not Indie bands have talent, I'll tell you that the BVBs have more talent that you could imagine!\n", "val": 0.015330064110457897}
{"text": "What a great start in the physical media world for Back Veil Brides!I granted 4.5 or 5 stars to most of the songs in the album, which makes it a great debut album. Only one song did not make it with me. Andy Sixx and his band play what I'll call \"soft screemo\". Still has plenty of punch, although I feel it could use a bit more at times. I am not a great fan of singers who roar indistinctly like they're about to puke a cat from their throat; Thankfully Andy is quite articulate and the guitar playing in every song is magnificent. Recording quality is great and crisp too, you can really hear each instrument and even each separate note.- The title song \"We Stitch These Wounds\" (5*) sets the tone to the album, although dumb as I am, I admit it took me a two consecutive listenings to the album to raise it from 4 to 5 stars.- \"Beautiful Remains\" (5*) is even more dynamic and screamo, great music, voices and rhythm all over.- \"Children Surrender\" (5*) is quite catchy, with great guitar riffs and changes of tone and voice accompaniments. One of my favorite songs after the next two.- But the highlight of the album is probably \"Perfect Weapon\" (5*) and \"Knives And Pens\" (5*). These are songs that will stay with you for life and sell you the whole album on their own merit. Check them out full length on YouTube.- \"Never Give In\" (5*) is the actual call to arms of the intro, and the sweet \"Carolyn\" (5*) is a fantastic song, both are right there with \"Children Surrender\" behind my 2 other favs.- The other 4 songs are getting there too, except for \"The Mortician's Daughter\" (3*), a slow love song that sounds like a filler. It's nice to break the screemo rhythm once in a while, but not at the cost of breaking the album's cohesion.- \"All Your Hate\" (4.5*) has superb guitar riffs, \"Heaven's Calling\" (4*) is great too, with its stereo screemo effects, \"Sweet Blasphemy\" (4.5) should be the anthem of all teenagers. I won't edit this review, but I am pretty sure I'll eventually raise these 3 songs to 5* after a few more listens.At $13 just a week after its release, you can't go wrong with this album.Oh, and disregard the 1-star rating from the angry customer that has a grudge against screemo and scene kids, and speaks mostly about the myspace site, the words in the song titles or in the lyrics, the 30-second vocal intro, but never about the music or the album.If you like debut albums, check out Sweedish teenager Johan Palm's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/My-Antidote/dp/B002610I1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Antidote</a>. Definitely not screemo, more like rock/pop (I hate stupid labels!), but it's kind of the same \"call to arms\" sort of theme.\n", "val": 0.011244555935263634}
{"text": "My first encounter with Black Veil Brides was probably the same as most people's, a viewing of their hit video, 'Knives and Pens.' I watched it twice, unable to believe just how perfectly this band fit into the popular 'post-hardcore' (a.k.a., 'emo') clique/genre. It was even difficult to believe the band actually took themselves seriously and were not just a parody of post-hardcore bands. The video has all the trademarks of the movement; when the lead singer, Andy Sixx is first seen, he is dressed in skinny jeans, a V-neck shirt, and sports the typical scene-do: teased, with way too much hairspray. He looks up, showing off his eyeliner and very silly-looking 'zombie' mouth makeup,and grins 'manically' in what he apparently hopes will be a disturbing or frightening way at the camera. (I laughed). For those unfamiliar with screamo/emo music, this is a typical move used by legions of post-hardcore bands. A few shots later, Sixx employs the use of another popular screamo move, the 'swing the microphone cord around your head like a lasso.' Yee-haw! Then he skips forward like a little girl before leaning in towards the camera to do the 'evil' grin a second time. (\"See my make-up? Ya see it? Real hard-core, huh?\")Next, the band establishes up front what kind of kids they're seeking to corrupt and get big off of through their self-pitying music by showing a little emo boy, maybe in 6th grade, dressed in skinnies, black converse, and a bandanna,  being picked on at school. The first word that Sixx sings? \"Alone.\"The song goes on for just long enough to touch on all the trademarks of screamo/emo music. Annoying, tired guitar riffs, angsty, childish lyrics, not-so-inspired screams, and of course...right when you feel it coming, the stereo-typical one chord breakdown, spiced up with a squeal here and there. Oh, and the kid gets bullied some more. But don't despair, Black Veil Brides want to help!  After the instant success of this video, it wasn't too long before some very crafty marketers and Black Veil Brides got together to conquer every Hot Topic from West coast to East coast and the band started recording. The result?The 'highly anticipated' debut album, 'We Stitch These Wounds.'Before reviewing the music, perhaps we should see what Black Veil Bride's have to say for themselves. To do this, I'll go to BVB's favorite hang-out, Myspace. In their biography, they declare themselves a 'dark rock sensation.' (Dark rock...? Jeez, I just thought it was teenybopper music for that certain group of middle schoolers that want to be different...silly me.) Later they brag of their Hot Topic shelf space, forgetting that they share said shelf space with the likes of Justin Bieber, the Jonas Brothers, and Lady GaGa. (Somehow I have an inkling that there's a negative correlation between the amount of T shirts sold at Hot Topic and the quality of the artist's music.) In the following sentence, Black Veil Brides burden us with the disturbing information that their fans refer to themselves as Bridesmaids, a nickname that apparently the band encourages. So...we have a group of guys calling themselves 'brides',(in other words, declaring that they are women), and we have their fans calling themselves Bridesmaids? (According to Wikipedia, a bridesmaid is \"...typically a young woman.\") And yet young emo boys think that they are hardcore for being a fan of this band... Lastly, Black Veil Brides 'mention' that they ranked 9th in Myspace's  Top Music Charts...in the Metal category. This is thrown out seemingly nonchalantly, but it is painfully obvious to the more astute reader that BVB's is actually attempting to convince you that they are real metal, not emo pop. After all, Myspace said so!In case this is not enough, the photos of the band on their Myspace page should be enough to convince most reasonably mature, intelligent people that the band is made up of Alice Cooper-wannabe posers. All band members are dressed in the usual scene style with ridiculously teased hair, but go to the added measure of caking themselves in unoriginal white and black makeup. Apparently too lazy to come up with something original, or perhaps just fully aware that their fans wouldn't be able to tell rip offs from the real thing, they shamelessly copy Alice Cooper's and Kiss's old makeup designs from the 70's. In case this still isn't enough, the band also resorts to overused, dumb poses for their photo shoots. Andy Sixx looks skyward with puppy dog eyes, hands together as if in prayer. Ashley Purdy raises his hand up in not one, but two pictures in an effort to be absolutely sure that his new fingerless gloves are seen by all.  Furthermore, the band also insists that they have 'over the top theatrics.' (Yeah, that's really cool, BVB. I realize that you wish you were Alice Cooper, but you are not, Andy Sixx, and won't ever be, no matter how much eyeliner you wear).  Now, onto the music of their debut. The album kicks off with 'The Outcasts (Call to Arms)'. Yes, you heard correctly. This band even has a 'call to arms' like so many other bands of the same genre. \"This record is for the Outcasts. Following our stories of Love, Life, And Never Giving In\" introduces a voice. Really? Are you kidding me? Yes, the band, desperate to fit into the annoying clique of emo screamo, even openly states that their music is strictly for the elite, the 'outcasts.' But they also have that usual ounce of hope--\"never giving in.\" That's so inspiring, Andy Sixx.Track two is 'We Stitch These Wounds.' \"You kissed the lips of evil..\" sings Sixx in the first line. Now, what that's supposed to mean, I don't know, but it's a line laced with popular emo words (kissed, lips, evil), so it works. The chorus is made up of more screams from Andy about how \"You're by yourself!\"'Beautiful Remains' falls back on that unbelievably cliche plot, fully exhausted by 2004 but still used by countless bands yearly, of the guy's girlfriend dying. She dies, he sets her on fire, because fire is cool and daredevil, after all, and he gets a little emotional because \"All we've fought for now is dead.\" Essentially, a break up song for the emo kids.'Children Surrender' does nothing that hasn't already been done before in the previous tracks, except boast lyrics that make even less sense. Example: \"An exorcise of life to cut beneath our hands,Like souls who missed their plight, we'll bleed along the sand.\" So how do you cut an exorcise of life, I wonder? And how is that 'like souls who missed their plight', a.k.a., a dangerous or difficult situation? The rather pointless use of the word 'sand' also makes it clear that it was used solely to rhyme with 'hands.''Perfect Weapon' is a standard emo screamo tune, following the promising recipe of a catchy 'metalcore' opening guitar riff, and another irritating, unoriginal 'breakdown.' The lyrics are about an emo boy who stays up at night to make lists of victims, targeting those who have hurt him. In the chorus, Andy lets loose howls of \"YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!\" Yep, more lyrics about being alone. I'm sure many immature emo kids find this very easy to relate to, and therefor inspiring,but I find it sickening. We get it, you're on your own. Now find something WORTH singing about.Next is the aforementioned Knives and Pens, another celebration of glorifying being alone and emo, with some knives and pens for company.In the next track, the band decides to provide a break from the monotone screaming and wearisome riffing by changing things up with an acoustic song. Sadly, it is no less awful. In his lame Alice Cooper impersonation, Sixx warbles along for a few minutes with the help of Auto-tune. One can easily imagine the bandwriting this song; Sixx flipping through his Big Book of Emo Words and picking those that he likes best. \"Hmmm. Funerals. Funerals are for dead people. Dead people are emo. So funeral is good. What else? Oh, this is good...'pain.' Gotta use that. What else? Hmmm...scream, haunt, bleeding, promised, loved...now, how can I string these words together?\" The result? 'The Mortician's Daughter', a song written for Andy's girlfriend, whose father is, actually, a mortician. (Thanks to whatsherface for the correction.)'All Your Hate' is basically filler comprising of more emo words. 'Lonely, holy, deadly, blood red, hate, burn,die, lost....blahblahblah. Doesn't Andy have anything more to write about than this? It comes across as bad teen poetry.Track Nine: 'Heaven's Calling'. So, from the title, we may assume that Andy Sixx is now so caught up in his romantic emo world of darkness,morticians, loneliness, and death, that he is now ready to die. After all, Heaven is calling to him! Directly after he howls this declaration, he comes back in with some \"RAWRS!\" (It's easy to imagine some silly scene girls insisting \"It's dinosaur for 'I LUV YOU!\") Well, if you ever surrender to heaven's beckons, Mister Sixx, I know at least one person who won't miss you. THIS GUY!The next track exemplifies what BVB earlier insisted their message is, never giving in. The name of the track? Never Give In, of course. In this hopeful composition written to help kids pull through being teased at school for being emo, Sixx sings \"Never give in, never back down.\" This creates an interesting chicken and egg scenario. Kids apparently credit BVB with giving them hope and helping them survive being teased and bullied for being emo, but these same kids only become 'emo' in the first place because of listening to bands such as BVB, who glorify being one and make gullible kids think it's cool to.Sweet Blasphemy: More filler about being strong in sadness. Stereotypical tune.The album finishes with 'Carolyn.' This tune stands out for being the first time BVB declare 'You're not alone.' Huh? But for the last eleven songs all you've been telling me is that I AM alone...I'm confused, Mister Sixx.Musically, the album achieves nothing but rehashing everything most terrible about emo screamo music. Although the band is admittedly competent technically, writing music is decidedly not their forte. However, if you answer yes to most or any of the following, Black Veil Brides: We Stitch These Wounds may be right for you:1. Do you delight in dwelling on everything that's wrong with your life?2. Did your mommy buy you a Medium and not the Large soda that you WANTED at McDonald's? (She must not love you.)3. Do you insist that all your clothes were bought at Hot Topic?4. Do you enjoy bands such as Escape the Fate, From First to Last, Attack Attack!, and Asking Alexandria, and feel you relate to their lyrics?5. Have you ever fantasized about killing your girlfriend so you can be together in death?6. Is your mouth open with your hands clutching an imaginary heart in your Myspace profile pic?7. Do you straighten your hair over at least one eye to show you are unique?8. Do you hate all that is mainstream, and feign an undying love for Hello Kitty, poetry, Elmo, and Dinosawrs, and have lots of other cute 'obsessions'?9. Do you insist that you are 'above the influence' yet constantly follow the current trend of acting like a  toddler?10. Do you boast of your nonexistent suicide attempts and cutting sessions, and try desperately to sound h@rdC0r3 by bragging on Facebook of how wasted you are?11. Are you under the age of 14?12. Most importantly, are you alone?If so, spend your money on this CD. BVB will stitch your emotional wounds and you won't be disappointed.However, to the rest of us, it should be clear that BVB's music is marketed specifically for young kids, primarily girls, who can drool to their heart's content over Andy Sixx no matter how awful the music is.Black Veil Brides is just the newest popular trend, one that shouldn't be followed.\n", "val": 3.795853626797907e-05}
{"text": "So finally one of the most anticipated debut albums this year, \"We Stitch These Wounds\", has finally landed on the music waves, and I have to say it doesn't disappoint.  With a fan fervor that matches the Bieber fever, the Black Veil Brides army can be satisfied with an actual full length CD that they can play over and over again.  To the new people finding out about them, their image may be a bit polarizing and off putting.  However, I think that the image adds to their overall draw.  They want to create a complete band including the good music and a particular look.  They have said that they can be whatever kind of band someone wants, and they fulfill that with this album.  With some awesome guitars by Jake Pitts and Jinxx, and some great work by Ashley Purdy on bass, they bring in those people that love A7X, BFMV, Atreyu, etc.  For anybody who loves good drummers, they will be amazed by Miss Sandra on the drums.  Yes, they have a female drummer!  She is truly a unique feature to this band.  Now, to Mr. Andy Six, he definitely has a beautiful deep voice that is intriguing to listen to.  There is intensity in his voice, but also a beautiful melody in songs like \"The Mortician's Daughter\" and \"Carolyn\".  His voice captures you in songs like \"Sweet Blasphemy\", \"Beautiful Remains\", and \"Heaven's Calling\".  Now, in saying that, this album is definitely a first step for this band.  It is a little all over the place, and the voice of this band is still being refined.  I think with getting this first album under them, and touring around for a while, they will bust out another album that will truly blow all stereotypes away.  There is true potential in this band, and \"We Stitch These Wounds\" showcases that very well.  For the fans that have followed them, enjoy having the full length album we have waited so long for.  To the people who are unsure, listen to the album and block out the other thoughts you have.  You will see potential for this young band!\n", "val": 0.027156038209795952}

{"text": "Wow. Just wow. This album was so good! I listened to it on repeat for a month straight! I learned a few of the songs on guitar (it sounds kinda like I'm playing them well) and even tried doing acoustic covers of some of the tracks. These guys seemed to bring a style to the table that I just loved. I considered them Avenged Sevenfold meets Escape the Fate. Or maybe Escape the Fate with a better vocalist (eyes on you Mabbit). The guitar work was great. Fast riffs, some heaviness thrown in with some poppy sounding hooks that helped them get noticed and shot straight up to popularity!And there's the problem. These guys put out this amazing album to get noticed and immediately changed their sound and style as soon as they had a fan base. We Stitch These Wounds was basically their gateway to try and get popular so they could eventually shovel this KISS-wannabe persona and poorly written (not to mention boring) songs they brought to us in their three albums following this one. I even saw them live in 2011 at Warped right after they release their secons album Set The World On Fire. The band performed well, though the vocalist was pretty far off his keys and his harsh vocals were just terrible. Plus, on stage Andy Sixx (another way to try and play off another bands fame) or Biersack? I guess he changed it back. Whatever. He gets on stage, grabs himself inappropriately and begins pointing to all the little Tweens there to see him tell them to blow him. I've never seen so many disappointed/pissed off kids/parents, except maybe at the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Atleast they weren't aliens right?I wish Black Veil Brides would have stuck with this style. They did it so well. I still even listen to this album. Though, I won't ever say that I listen to Black Veil Brides. Because the band going by that name now is just dissappointing.\n", "val": 0.0002477524394635111}

When i first heard of these guys i heard of there stuff from 2011-present that was hair metal, an purchased this album originally on CD(before the vinyl version) thinking can't wait to hear it when i heard there screaming. Now at first i hated it, but now i can honestly say i do like there screaming and some other bands screaming, but i am not a huge screamo/metalcore fan. The album opens up with andys grandfather giving an introduction, and then we go into the re-recorded We Stich These Wounds(which i have the original version). I prefer the original version but he one on the album is cool too. You have classic Tracks on hear such as Never Give In, Beautiful Remains, sweet blasphemy, Perfect Weapon, Knifes and Pens. What i like about this album is even thou it is a metalcore/scream album it still has some of the Hair Metal elements that would be seen in Set The World On Fire, and what Andy wanted Black Veil brides to be in the first place.\n", "val": 0.006947795860469341}

I had all but given up on rock as the players tended to be more interested in radio play then staying true to rock.. until Black Veil Brides came along. Power drums, guitar, and vocals make for an amazing sonic experience.

{"text": "Like pretty much everyone else, I found this band through YouTube. Liking \"Knives and Pens\" and \"Perfect Weapon\" I picked this album up at FYE. BTW, good sign for an \"internet band\" that their album can be found at an actual music store. Anyway, overall, I have to say I enjoy this album. It's catchy, it's melodic, and I loved the rather gothic overtones layered on top of the usual \"post-hardcore\"/melodic metal formula. (BTW, someone must explain \"Post-hardcore\" to me. From First to Last is about as similar to Agnostic Front as Lady Gaga. I must be missing something...). I'll admit I'm a sucker for bands that layer on the guyliner and have hair that dwarfs Dwight Howard, but Black Veil Brides manage to craft some actually decent songs to go with all the looks. Almost all combine fast, catchy, almost thrashy riffs with Andy Sixx's lyrical story telling and some decent lead work, then add a touch of teenage goth kid angst for flavor, making this album a dark and spooky trip through modern metal in teen suburbia. Sure, it has the vibe of the musical equivalent of a meal from Taco Bell, and if anyone remembers this band next year I will be surprised, but if big riffs, catchy coruses, and dark aesthetics are your thing, grab on for the ride, cuz it's fun as hell. If your looking for something that will blow your mind and expose you to something new or some innovative songwritting, then this won't satisfy you (although may I reccommend Opeth or Porcupine Tree? Maybe something older like Dissection or King Crimson then?) but if your just looking for a fun, catchy, fast paced goodtime, then this disc will stay in your rotation for a while.\n", "val": 0.0010846990626305342}

{"text": "After listening to this album I immediately wanted to cry. I know that this band has a huge following (mainly prepubescent girls) but I have to say that this album is mediocre at best. Among Andy Sixx's horrible screaming and BVB's cliche guitar riffs there is very little that this band offers...except for looks.(Putting akward and outdated aesthetics aside for a moment) I would like to point out that as a business man Andy Sixx is a pretty smart guy. He found a way to exploit nearly every 15 year old scenster in America into falling in love with him.On top of that he also managed to get signed by Rise Records and had the pleasure to tour with amazing bands such as From First To Last, Confide and Sleeping With Sirens. For this I gave BVB 2 stars rather than just 1.Now on to the actual review.Upon listening to this album I had come to relise that not only did they rip off Avenged Sevenfold in the song \"Kives and Pens\", Andy Sixx also managed to capitalize on Avenged Sevenfolds vocal stylings. So if you are a big A7x fan I'd be prepared to rage to the max.Below I show what listeners can find in this album based on age and social cliches.- If you are a 15 year old and are deep into the \"emo\" scene than this album is probably for you. Wait scratch that! It is for you.- If you are into some heavy breakdowns and some progressive beats I would turn away while you still can. In the song \"Knives and Pens\" the breakdown at the end is so simplistic that I could predict the rythm as I played along on my guitar. It's really that easy.- If you are an older classical 80's metal fan I'm sure you will adore the guitar work. That is if you can get through Andy Sixx's horrible monotoned vocals.But if that's what you are looking for then you should check out Blessed by a Broken Heart. They are way more brutal and much more technical. (Also, vocals are solid)My closing statement on this review is that if you really want to fall into the image of a lonely emo kid then by all means this band is exactly what you need. Just don't get mad at me in 2 years when you are selling your BVB albums to Half Priced Books because you found out that all BVB does is exploit a social cliche.\n", "val": 0.0011758272303268313}

{"text": "As Bowling for Soup would refer to it: The 3-song single. Aimed as the new single for the band's latest release - 'Fishin' for Woos' showcasing the song \"I've Never Done Anything Like This\" featuring Kay Hanley.I've Never Done Anything Like This: As soon as the song starts, you know exactly what to expect. It has that high-energy fun factor that you've grown to know and love from the band. Crunchy distorted guitars, ridiculously catchy vocal melodies and humorous lyrics.Stacy's Mom: A song that the band is notoriously mistaken for doing. Well, not anymore. A pretty straight forward cover of Fountains of Wayne's 'hit song'. More than anything to me this is just a nice nod from the band to their fans touching on a somewhat long term running joke. It's actually pretty crazy actually hearing them perform it. A good cover overall.The Bitch Song (2011): This to me is the real gem of the release. A re-recorded version of their first single on a major label. The original was released 11 years ago on 2000's 'Let's do it for Johnny!'. The recording is crisp, clean and everything you could possibly want it to be. I've always been a big fan of bands re releasing newer versions of old songs. You get to compare the two and see how the singing, playing and overall quality has changed over the years. Defiantly worth the price tag alone.All together, if you like the band I don't think you'll be disappointed with the purchase. Hopefully we'll get more things like this in the future. It's a nice intensive for those who already own the album to get excited over the singles.

All of their recordings are very good but I've always felt that the \"Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers\" CD was their best effort.  This blows that away! And the very best part is that these guys tour extensively and make you appreciate them even more after you hear the songs live.  I enjoyed reading and concur with the many fine comments left in the other reviews about this band and this album.  There really are many great songs.  I often enjoy wondering which tune will finally get them over the top to the big time.  With this album there are quite a few new contenders.  For me, I have to admit that \"We belong here\" is the song that I can't stop hearing in my head.  Upbeat / bold / entire band at their best!!!  If I was a betting man, I would put my money on that song.  When they finally get that one song that makes it big, their deserved, much larger fan base will be amazed at all of the great songs they've assembled.  *** - I hope that this one last suggestion might be help - There are also MANY excellent songs on this band's other recently released recording called One Night in Brooklyn.  It appears as all of the marketing effort is rightly going in to Gift Horse but those that can't get enough of this band shouldn't overlook that recording.

{"text": "I have loved this comedy album by the great Lily Tomlin for over 35 years.  Lily recorded this live before an audience at the Ice House in Pasadena, California, performing as Edith Ann, the world-weary yet innocent five-and-a-half year old philosopher and \"lady\", a new unsuspecting resident in the neighborhood whom she hounds.  This album is two long, richly comic monologues, on one Edith Ann walks the stranger home from work as she looks for her missing dog, Buster; the other one is when Edith shows up uninvited at the woman's house apparently the next day.  The comedy has not lost a bit of it's tang after 40 years even with the occasional reference to something topical (ie: peace demonstrations) but most of the topics here never change for new generations of children, whether it's the joy of playing in the box a refrigerator comes in, sibling rivalry, or making crafts with your momma's picture and a box of Quaker Oats.  We learn a lot about Edith Ann's never seen or heard family from her laid-off, liquour-loving father (\"every Christmas we get a new ashtray from Parr's bar.  Mama says 'Isn't it pretty? And it only costs $2,000.  It's plastic and it says Parr's bar\"), her long-suffering Tupperware hostess-mother, bullying old sister and brother, and the new baby of the house.  And of course, Edith Ann who shares her knowledge on homemade lipstick, mysteriously dirty baby booties, and x-rated movies (\"in X-rated movies, they kiss with no clothes on\".)I hope this wonderful comedy album will one day get a US CD release; it's been my favorite comedy record for nearly forty years - and most certainly, that is the truth!!\n", "val": 0.014662596397101879}

If you love metal and love classic NES tunes from Castlevania, Double Dragon, and Zelda you will most likely love this music.The tracks are 'exact' metal versions of these theme songs. Some people mess with harmony and melody when performing odes to classic game tunes, creating remixes. Remixes are fine, but I prefer the pounding metalsalute Vomitron has thrust in my ear-holes.My personal favorite track is the Zelda II medley, all the major themes from the game are represented in this one track. All of the major game tracks (Contra, Castlevania, etc) are also amazing medleys, which take you on a journey through the best music from each game. The major Tetris themes are scattered throughout the album as well (Troika, Korobeyniki, etc). This album brings back all those memories of being a Nintendo kid in the 80s.Again, if you love both game music and metal, or love either one exclusively, I can't recommend 'No NES for the Wicked' enough.\n", "val": 0.009546407498419285}

{"text": "Now, I am the type to buy discs as opposed to just mp3s because I like to have the physical backup and to not need the internet should something happen to my files.  In this case, however, I made the exception because the album only has two tracks and the discs are becoming very rare.  That would have added up to me paying 15 dollars, plus shipping and handling, for just two tracks.  Trouble is, I'm still tempted to think that it would have been worth it.Buckethead, in case you don't know about him, is a prolific and amazingly talented solo guitarist with at least 40 solo albums to his name apart from collaborations and albums as a member of other bands.  He is amazingly diverse as well, playing anything from prog rock to metal to trance.  In this particular album he plays a style halfway between mainstream rock and prog rock, so although the album has only two tracks it clocks in at about 30 minutes of music.These aren't a boring 30 minutes either.  Yes, nothing is perfect, and if I had to chose between the two tracks I would choose the shorter one but only because it is the more complex piece of music.  Track one is the shorter track, titled \"Golden Eyes,\" opening with some more mellow riffs and then adding in a very distinct bass line and some semi-funk drumming.  As the song progresses Buckethead's guitar playing speeds up until it reaches the intense shredding that hard-core fans have come to know and love.  There are some parts where the shredding can be a bit repetitive but just the fact that it is so intense for such a long time will keep you mesmerized; you will be wondering how anyone's wrists can bear such a strain.  And even though the guitar takes center stage here as usual, more seriously musical listeners will be able to enjoy the layering from the rhythm section.Track two, \"Look Up There,\" is the lesser track despite it being twice as long as the first.  Again, a more mellow feel to this song, with the guitar taking up the spotlight.  This normally would not be bad, but unfortunately the rhythm section here tend to just repeat itself over and over, making for a bit of a dull bass line.  The drums are once again excellent, and the guitars are good, but the bass line does leave you wanting a little bit more.Despite the repetitive bass of the second track this album still has an incredible pull on me; I go to it over and over again, even the second track which, even though it's the reason I can't give a full five stars to the album, still make for a very soothing and entertaining semi-prog feel.  It's only a two-track album, but there are many, many albums with four or more times the number of tracks that are much, much worse.\n", "val": 0.003470350056886673}

Heads above the rest of the guitar world in terms of creativity, Ron explores the fronteirs of music theory by proving that one is not limited by traditional boundaries.  Moreover, the band boasts and showcases talented heavy hitters in Alex Webster and Hannes Grossmann - who perform wonders in terms of managing difficult time signatures.

{"text": "Some musical geniuses ruin their music by being purely technical and sacrificing song writing ability.  Ron Jarzombek is not one of those geniuses.  In that sense, he's kind of like Chopin, who was credited as being one of the first to blend technicality with emotion.  Prior to that, people thought they were mutually exclusive.While I'm not trying to detract from the rest of the band (which is absolutely awesome), this is really a Ron brainchild, and I'm speaking about it as such.  The drumming and bass are fantastic, and worthy of Ron.  These guys are so tight.  That said, this is probably Ron's heaviest and most dissonant offering, as he kind of suspects on his page.  I can still tell a difference between this  style and Duodecimal Levorotation, for whatever reason, but they are similar.I highly recommend checking out the video that goes along with Cretaceous Chasm, from his page.  Very well done, and very bad-(first letter of alphabet, and then \"ss\").  I'm a pretty musical and technically-inclined guy, and I play guitar and enjoy performing complicated, musicically-challenging solos on my 7-string.  However, I'm still not sure I am able to fully appreciate Ron Jarzombek.  I mean, I think I can, but he's probably enough beyond me where only he can fully appreciate what he does.\n", "val": 0.0011834868928417563}

{"text": "So I downloaded this EP from Amazon and as usual was blown away by Ron Jarzombek's fret board pyrotechnics. I assume this is only a teaser for what is to come within the next year: a new full length LP. I own both Watchtower albums (Ron only played on the second album), both Spastic Ink albums & of course \"The Machinations of Dementia\" by Blotted Science. Ron is a truly gifted guitarist but though he is a technical player he writes music that has the ability to stick with you (and be down right weird as well).This EP features the famed Alex Webster of Cannibal Corpse once again handling the bass. This time we have one Hannes Grossmann of Obscura fame handling the drums. Hannes is truly gifted drummer and lends his distinct voice to this recording in how he phrases the music and along with Ron & Alex, communicating his ideas for the music.This is exactly what you'd expect from Ron and Blotted Science (or any project with him involved, for that matter). Highly technical music but with HUGE amounts of drive and melody -odd time signatures, unconventional arrangements and just plain lunacy in the highest degree of professional musicianship. They aren't just cramming notes into as little space as possible -they play with a high degree of well thought out design.An absolute must for any die hard tech-metalhead into extreme metal with bite, punch and a point.\n", "val": 0.011557810008525848}

And the new drummer is sick with those blast beats! For the Blotted Science fans out there, this one delivers! I just wish it wasn't so short.

It's one of those albums you pop in your disc changer, but months later you dare not take it out. While I have Alberta Cross' 7 song EP, and it's good, Broken Side of Time will rock much harder from start to finish. You won't skip a track. The singing croons a bit like Neil Young, but in an edgy darker way. Perhaps if Neil Young himself started today, this is what he'd produce in voice, but it rocks you like a Zeppelin album.

In the past decade, only Mastodon's Remission, The Mars Volta's De-loused, Muse's Origins of Symmetry and Oceanic by Isis made me think that something new and vital (and, yes, maybe proggy) was happening in the rock scene. This album is very different to those, but its shimmering anthemic grooves have me playing it beginning to end constantly. Imagine Canned Heat, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, and The Decemberists and you're some way towards this band's sound.'Rise from the Shadows' slithers along, built on a sinuous bass line, and then rises effortlessly into its chorus; 'Leave Us and Forgive Us' couches its La's-ish indie sound in shoegazery lushness; 'ATX' is a stomper with a chugging riff that proves they can get their rocks off; 'The Thief & the Heartbreaker' gets a fuller production than on the bands earlier EP (though some might prefer the aching rawness of the original; 'City Walls' shivers with spooky atmospherics...Seriously, there's not a dud track in sight.

With that said, this is a beautiful song and I'm so glad a friend played it for me!It's soft and sweet, never building to an overpowering crescendo - I added it to my \"lullabies\" playlist.For anyone who may be in my shoes, why not give it a listen? There are no vampire or werewolf-specific lyrics. It's a lovely, contemplative song. And for Team Edward, I would think this gorgeous number goes without saying.I heartily suggest checking it out!\n", "val": 0.001835318747907877}

{"text": "I purchased and tried to download this song for 50 cents more than the last time I purchased a song from Amazon. It was advertised as a downloadable MP3 file. However, no longer can you simply buy and download a song to your computer to play or do with as you wish: that is, for me, record it to a compilation CD I was making. You can now access your purchase ONLY on \"your\" Cloud player or through the Amazon downloader via Windows Media Player or iTunes. However, I choose not to have Big Brother following me around observing what songs I listen to and when, so I will NOT use a music player like iTunes that not only requires you to connect to the Internet but also is infamous for putting secret, unwanted \"drive-by\" installations on your computer any time you update it without giving you a choice.Bottom line: I could not simply have the song in the MP3 format advertised and, for example, record it to a CD to play on my home stereo or in my car.If Amazon had been truthful in their avertising, I would have gone out and bought the actual, physical CD at a store rather than downloading the song from Amazon (they used to be 99 cents each; now suddenly, they've jumped up to $1.49 despite having become worthless) since I can listen to my latest purchase ONLY on my computer. I'm not rich enough to afford the latest smart phones or tablets, nor am I interested in having one, so to listen to or share the song with a friend or play it at a party, I must be chained to my non-hi-fi-sound-quality computer. Making this purchase a complete waste of time and money, which I would like a refund for, but I'm sure Amazon doesn't care.I am very disappointed in Amazon's new policy and will no longer be making music purchases from this company. When I BUY an \"MP3\" file (lower quality than a .wav/.cda, which is the standard CD format), I expect to be able to burn it to a CD so that I can actually LISTEN to it without being chained to my computer. I expect to be able to hold my purchase in my hand, not have to use my computer to access it up in the clouds somewhere. >:(\n", "val": 1.905983117467258e-05}

You know the kind; one's that turn out to play the same thing as the others, and \"a mix\" consists of only a handful of songs that they play on repeat, until even the songs that you liked becomes songs you're tired of hearing for the 3rd time in 2 hours.After listening to our radio in autopilot for most of the ride home, hearing all the usual half-talents and remixes, Christina Perri's 'A Thousand Years' came on. I literally sat up and said \"wait, turn it up.. What is this? This is actually GOOD\".Even though technicaly, yes, the song was used for a Twilight film, it doesn't change the fact that I really love the song. It'd be like hating an author because one of his best books was butchered and made into a really bad movie.Christina Perri reminds me of Sara Bareilles in the fact that she actually has talent.She has a way of transporting you through her music, or at the very least capable of getting an emotional rise out of you. Its easy listening music, that you can relax to, or set on repeat and let it fade into the background.With a pleasant melody beautiful lyrics and a pretty voice, 'Thousand Years' is a song that in today's music stands out as something different. Something that can play over and over, without being boring, and something that was well worth paying .99 cents for!\n", "val": 0.008176782168447971}

Oh well.I'll stop my controversial comments about that movie, which many people practically worship, and go back to this amazing song!The MP3 itself: the sound quality is good, though I don't claim to be an expert on that sort of thing, and it downloaded well.This beautiful, sweet, tender love song is 100% worth the 99 cents I paid for it!!\n", "val": 0.03057641163468361}

{"text": "I only recently (re) discovered Robyn, before Parts 1 and 2 of this album came out.  It's been sort of a journey with her as the first release hit, and became an instant staple in my collection.  Then part 2 came out and it was simply flawless.  With the advent of the full release, she's collected the most impactful songs from the preview albums and added 5 new tracks for a musical experience that I can honestly say is unparalleled.New tracks \"Time Machine\" and \"Call Your Girlfriend\" will take your breath away.  If you haven't already heard it (released as a single), the fully produced version of \"Indestructible\" is on par with standout holdovers \"Hang with Me\" (the acoustic version from part 1 is equally good) and \"Dancing on My Own\" showing that Robyn is one of the most amazing lyricists in recent memory.  The arrangements are so rich and intricate you're not sure if you want to dance or cry.  I recommend both.I'll leave the technical reviews to those better qualified, but for anyone who is just discovering this album, it's an instant purchase.  And, if you're like me and have been following the release slate, there's enough new here to merit the purchase, especially if amazon keeps the price down.If nothing else, pick up \"Time Machine\" and \"Call Your Girlfriend\".

The 4 new songs (\"time machine\", \"call your gf\", \"stars\" and \"get myself together\") are 4 out of my favorite 7 or 8 songs out of all the Body Talk songs, which is saying a lot, they are all amazing additions. \"Call Your Girlfriend\" is the best of the new bunch, beat and melodies are amazing, and the idea of the \"mistress\" point of view is clever. My only beef is her leaving off \"Cry When You Get Older\" which imo was the best song she release this year. Either way this album is a must have, if Lady Gaga released this album almost every song would be #1 in the U.S. people need to stop sleeping on Robyn!\n", "val": 0.03260718658566475}
{"text": "As the finished Body Talk album finally is here, one cannot help but feel kind of cheated. This is a great album, no doubt, but it's hard to understand the format of the release by other means besides capitalistic logic.This album contains 15 pop bangers. They are all great songs. But 10 of those songs have been released previously on Body Talk pt. 1 & 2. On those 2 parts combined, there was an extra 6 songs available that is not available here. Those 6 songs would've been used as b-sides to the singles in the olden days. But instead they've helped Robyn and her label stretch what is essentially 1 album with 15 songs - where the singles could have held 6 potential b-sides - into 3 albums! That is incredibly clever from a business standpoint.Having said that, this is a great album. Robyn is part of the absolute vanguard of popular culture that is transforming the entire genre into great postmodern art. As I see it, there is but one artist in the world today doing what Robyn is doing better: Ke$ha (who has released 2 great albums this year, which includes even more subversive pop-bangers than the Body Talk trilogy combined).For those of you that don't already own part 1 and 2 of Body Talk, this is a must-buy!For those of you that do own those parts, you should just buy the 5 new songs as digital downloads, in an attempt to defy capitalism making you another victim. This is great musical postmodern pop-art, but it's too bad that an exciting concept turned into a monetary rip-off scheme rather than 3 individual albums.4 stars for the music, 0 stars for the format.\n", "val": 0.00031949192634783685}

I know i have a bias for the swedes, but i don't care!That out of the way, i do not feel that this album is as great as it could have been. Hang with Me and Indestructible were great songs in their acoustic forms that here on this album, get bogged down in boring, samey/same production. Of the new songs that were not on parts 1 or 2, Call your girlfriend is easily the best and time machine follows closely. But how a song like \" Stars 4-ever\" could beat out Criminal Intent, from part 2, i cannot fathom.  i would have even rather had \"include me out\" on here instead of Dance hall Queen (the weakest cut from part 1) and where the hell is cry when you get older?!I guess the problem with this \"album\" is that as a whole, it doesn't match the greatness of its' \"parts\".

{"text": "Robyn's Body Talk is the most interesting pop music I've heard in years. The closest I can come to describe it is to say it's like a combination of the oddness of Bjork, the confidence of Madonna or Lady Gaga, and the pop savviness of Roxette and Kylie Minogue. Much like Janelle Monae in the R&B genre, Robyn has found a way to innovate within the dance/pop genre while making songs with sincere emotions and a clarity of vision that is maintained throughout the entire album. The hooks and melodies are memorable, and there's a wide variety of styles, featuring some excellent, often very clever lyrics. \"Call Your Girlfriend,\" for example, takes the perspective of \"the other woman\" in a relationship, giving advice on how a boyfriend should break up with his girlfriend in the most considerate way possible. This is a wonderful concept for a song, and everything else in the song backs up the idea perfectly. I consider it one of the best pop singles I've ever heard. Just as good is the first song here, \"Dancing On My Own,\" a beautiful and emotional song.Much has been said already about how the three-part Body Talk releases came about, so I won't take time discussing that. Suffice it to say, all the releases are worth having, and I think this might just be the best of the bunch. I found the self-titled \"Robyn\" album to be excellent, if a little manic, and am pleased to say I think Body Talk is even better.

{"text": "After what felt like a long wait, I finally got my act together and bought Robyn's Body Talk, which is basically a marriage between a compilation album and an actually LP. I was afraid on my listen that Robyn wouldn't be able to top her sleeper hit dance record \"Robyn\". I am glad to report that I was wrong. \"Body Talk\" is a collect of progressive and innovative dance and electronica hits. Robyn and friends (pop music deities like Max Martin and Klaus Ahlund) continue to create great music with emotional lyrics. Ignoring Body Talk parts 1 thru etc, \"Body Talk\" captures Robyn's hard work. Gems for me include \"Dancing on my own\", \"In My Eyes\", & \"Star 4-Ever\". This is a great album to play during a workout or for that black light enchanted dance floors. My only gripe is that the album runs a little long, and there is a tendency for the songs to sound the same. There isn't enough switch in synths and bass from some track to track. Dare I say there is a point where an album can have enough techno.\n", "val": 0.006488143466413021}
{"text": "\"Bodytalk\" by Robyn is a very exciting and catchy cd that has many high-energy songs that cover the various facets of relationships and having fun.  What is great about this cd is that Robyn carefully put musical tracks that covered various facets of what can happen in life. For example, Robyn sings about keeping her guard up, and only revealing herself to the one special \"nice\" person in the edgy ballad that is \"Indestructible\".  \"Time Machine\" appears to be about her coming to terms with her past and present in assisting her in becoming wiser. \"We Dance to The Beat\", \"Dancehall Queen,\" and \"Stars 4-Ever\" appear to be about having fun and making the most of life.  \"Get Myself Together\" is also a great song about striving to create more harmony, balance, and fullfillment in one's life. \"Stars 4-Ever\" really stood out for me, but all of her other songs on this compilation are very well-put together as well. Robyn creatively projects a strong and powerful spirit in many of her songs.  It is my humble opinion that Robyn's Bodytalk cd symbolizes the creative musical growth that she has achieved since her 1990's musical days of \"Do You Know (What it Takes),\" and \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect). Please understand that I do think positively of her two well known 90's songs, but this \"Bodytalk\" compilation showcases her talent even more.  Robyn's \"Bodytalk\" compilation is very much recommended if you enjoy high-energy dance/pop music of a musician who projects much creativity and personal power.\n", "val": 0.04191034287214279}

{"text": "From first track to last, everything about Robyn's tour-de-force (a pop masterpiece) illustrates her careful consideration of both beats and lyrics. Don't mistake her for merely another menial pop queen - there's genuine feeling, pain, and (dare I say) maturity in her suggestions about relationships and love. Take, for instance, a song like \"Call Your Girlfriend,\" which could easily fall into such mediocre territory, as countless incarnations of a similar idea have before it. However, once deep into the song (or even after it), Robyn's layering of meanings becomes clear - she, having found a new man, instructs him to tell his current girlfriend the deal. Her intentions are not malicious, but personal - though never stated in the song, one can infer that a similar situation has happened to her before, where a boyfriend left her broken and without explanation. So, \"Call Your Girlfriend\" references both past and present relationships, though indirectly. Likewise, instant classic pop jams like \"Indestructible,\" \"Love Kills,\" \"Hang With Me,\" and \"Dancehall Queen\" bring appreciated levels of sophistication, along with sounding great. Wonderful to dance to, but also worthy of deeper contemplation, Robyn will be considered the real pop queen once there's time for serious re-evaluation.\n", "val": 0.013905706815421581}

I felt compelled to write a review because I just saw her live and hands down, it was one of the best live shows I've ever been to.  CD's are amazing, but if you have the chance to see a live show, do it.  You can appreciate the music so much better in that venue than listening to it in your car or ipod.The direction she went in with this music is incredible, she kills it!

{"text": "I guess I was a little confused, since I thought that the Body Talk concept involved 3 mini albums, each with completely original tracks. Instead, it's really more like Body Talk part 1 and part 2 were EPs, meant to tease the listener with morsels of the complete  \"Body Talk\" experience, with the final installment being the whole feast.And what a feast it is. \"Body Talk\" is easily the best pop album of 2010, and probably one of the best of the decade. When you hear the entire thing, without the quirky orchestral/acoustic versions of the some of the songs from the EPs, it's really an incredibly polished, consistent (and yet diverse), delightful, and fantastic electro-pop opus.It's hard to even pick what I think are the best tracks, since almost every one is a winner, but some of my favorites are: \"Dancing On My Own\", a heartfelt lament of love lost to a relentless indsutrial beat;  \"Indestructible\", (which appeared earlier in an alternate version, but the final version sounds amazing with a pulsing, throbbing soundscape); \"Time Machine\", an interesting song about regret; and \"U Should Know Better\", in which Robyn, a pixie-ish Swede, holds her own with a US rapper.\n", "val": 0.044155992567539215}
{"text": "Robyn is definitely one artist from the 1990s who stands out in my mind. I liked every song she released to radio during the 90s and that is why I gave \"Body Talk\" a chance. I dived into this album head first without reading any reviews or finding out any information on this album. Had I known this LP was a dance/techno/electronic album, I would still have listened, but I would have prepared myself since I am no fan of this genre of music.I am a lover of ballads, especially when sung by artists with voices who can carry out notes in an effective way like I know Robyn can. I was disappointed as I listened to \"Body Talk\" because I patiently waited for a ballad that never played because there are none here. Period. Instead what we have is 15 songs full of uptempo techno music. This album is an acquired taste by all means. It is geared toward those who enjoy techno music; that is what this album is filled with. Robyn still sounds great as ever, though. \"Dancehall Queen\" is an okay song. There is a Caribbean influence which is a nice touch. \"Dancing on My Own\" is a song about Robyn seeing her ex with another girl on the dance floor. It's one of the album's finer moments for sure. Snoop Dogg is featured on \"U Should Know Better.\" It was good that a rapper was added to this album for it is the only guest appearance, but he does not do a good job. The whole song is one of the album's biggest missteps. For starters, the F word is said one too many times. Additionally, the song is dumb and totally forgettable.Overall, I am not impressed.

Robyn has a unique Euro dance quality about her performances and I'm surprised she hasn't garnered more attention with her amazing dance tracks. She has a very electronic vibe throughout the whole album, starting from \"Fembot\" all the way through \"Stars-4-Ever.\" I feel that maybe one or two acoustic tracks from the first two \"Part\" EP's would have fit nicely here, but the dancepop feel is very dominant.If Robyn's new album has any drawbacks, it's that the other seven tracks from the \"Body Talk Pt. 1\" and \"Pt. 2\" EP's would have made this release feel more like an album. The tracks included here, however, make a fitting enough release to classify it as an important piece of dance material.

{"text": "Ten years ago there is no way I would have gone anywhere near an album such as this since it consists entirely of electronic dance pop and seemingly simplistic lyrics about love. I would have considered myself too cool for anything like that.  But my musical tastes have expanded quite a bit since then and thankfully so.  Otherwise I would have missed out on this absolutely stellar set of heartfelt pop songs spilling over with lovely melodies and hooky dance beats.  Body Talk is as fun as it is emotionally satisfynig which is quite a testament to the talents of its creator.The songs gathered on this set appear simple on the surface.  Robyn sings about subjects such as unrequited love, broken hearts, longing to be able to go back and do things differently and even stealing a guy away from another girl.  All of this sounds very immature, but Robyn imbues these familiar stories with true feeling and a suprising dose of maturity that seems to come from experience.  In the album opener \"Dancing On My Own\" for example, Robyn painits an achingly vivid picture of a young woman trying to hide the pain of being rejected by a guy at a party who is preoccupied with somebody else.  Instead of trying to make the dude jealous or tear down the other girl, she just keeps dancing on her own.  There is an undeniable sadness and dignity to this which gives an already beautiful song an added emotional kick.Even when Robyn sings about swiping a guy from another girl on \"Call Your Girlfriend\", she doesn't hurl childish insults and brag about her vicotry.  Instead, she encourages her new mate to let the other girl down easy--to promise her that they will still be friends and to not go into specifics about why the relationship isn't working out.  It would seem that Robyn, like most people, knows the pain of being dumped and doesn't wish any more pain than necessary on the \"other girl\".  She also seems to be more aware of how she can hurt guys by unintentionally leading them on.  In \"Hang With Me\", she tells a platonic friend that he can hang with her as long as he doesn't fall helplessly,hopelessly in love with her.You have to love pop music that is this emotiional, mature and honest as well as fun and vibrant.  There are a couple of missteps such as \"Don't[...] Tell Me What to Do\" and \"We Dance to the Beat\" which seem to be more concerned with attitude than substance, but they're not a major problem since the majority of the music on this album kills.  Sometimes you have to grow up in order to appreciate music that you used to think you hated.  And maybe in Robyn's case, you have to grow up in order to make it.\n", "val": 0.011955700814723969}

The beats are fantastic, the lyrics are funny and smart (you have to get the lyric sheet to catch everything) and the production is flawless. This was, without a doubt, the best album of 2010.

After all the glowing reviews of her Body Talk part 1 & 2 EPs, I thought I would check out what the fuss is all about and started listening to her songs online. One of the first songs I heard was \"Indestructible\". I was immediately hooked. It didn't take me long to get her Body Talk cd which combined both EPs. Asides from \"U Show Know Better\" and \"Dancehall Queen\" (the two weakest tracks), the album is addictive. I have been listening to the cd constantly.

(Also haven't cared enough to review another album since then) Her style is so different, and her songs are absolutely mesmerizing. The synth beats and sound effects combined with the musical instruments, the lyrics, and her voice are enough to take you to soo many different places in your head....it feels like time travel in another world. And only REALLY GOOD music is capable of producing that euphoric effect. I downloaded the MP3 version of this album, and added to my cd when burning it Robyn's other previous gems, \"Cry When You Get Older\", \"Blow My Mind\", and \"With Every Heartbeat\". I also switched out her original \"Hang With Me\" in favor of Avicii's remixed version. Great job, Robyn!!!!!

Naturally, I got all of the Body Talk albums, but was ecstatic to see most of the songs, plus 5 new tracks, on the Body Talk cd.  Every song on the cd is catchy and melodic.  Most of the songs have the quirky lyrics that I love Robyn for and all of the tracks are very danceable, especially \"Dancing On My Own,\" \"Time Machine,\" and \"None of Dem.\"  I also love the extra-long version of \"Fembot\" included here!I only wish that the acoustic versions of \"Indestructible\" and \"Hang With Me\" were included on this disc, but I can see why they were left off, since the final Body Talk album is a dance-pop album.

While some songs are intrepid and emphatic (\"Fembot,\" \"U Should Know Better,\" \"None of Dem\"), others are pensive, vulnerable, and genuine (\"Dancing on My Own,\" \"Call Your Girlfriend,\" \"Get Myself Together\").

{"text": "I've already reviewed the three parts to this album, and so I'm doing a little `cut and paste' action with this review.  I wasn't too surprised to see that this album was dropped as a complete disc, since that seems to be the mode (buy them one by one only to have it drop as one album when all is said and done) but this is one of the few occurances where buying them separate was the better way to go.  While this album contains most everything that was released on the individual `parts', this album is missing a few of the best tracks (like that `Dancing on My Own' remix).I'm glad I got the separate discs.That said, if you shoot for this album instead you won't be missing much, and it is still SOOOO worth owning (thus the A grade).I'm just going to break this out by the tracks included from the different parts.Part 1...`Fembot' is pretty explosive. The structure of this song is light, airy, pop-princess yumminess that totally adds the needed layers of edge that make it signature Robyn. `Dancehall Queen' may be my favorite track from that album (they are all so good though). It has an almost `Police-esque' vibe to it, with an air of Reggae influence until the bouncy chorus catches on and brings a gigantic smile to my face. Robyn has a beautiful way of making HAPPY music that is edgy enough to validate adult enjoyment.  `None of Dem' is slinky, seductive and completely engaging.  The original version of `Dancing on My Own' (which is the version included here) is heart-tugging in its context yet certainly worthy of dance-floor choreography. You get the idea that Robyn is the sweet and shafted heroine, which is soft and vulnerable in texture.  I was never a huge fan of `Don't Tell Me What To Do', but it has grown on me a great deal.The omissions from the actual singular disc include the remix of `Dancing on My Own', the acoustic version of `Hang With Me' (which is better than the version provided on this disc from `Pt. 2'), `Cry When I Get Older' (which is the least successful track from `Pt. 1', so it's omission is acceptable) and `Jag Vet En Dejlig Rosa', which is a sad omission since it is one of the most beautiful songs she has recorded.Part 2...`Hang With Me' and `Love Kills' rely on that tinge of commercial pop-quality that Robyn understands how to layer effectively. Her delivery is smooth and enticing and her songs are incredibly catchy. I got these beautiful glimpses of her 90's work all over these songs, which added a nice splash of nostalgia to the offering. `Hang With Me' has a beautiful beat and a sweet sincerity within the vocal delivery, although I really wish they had swapped this out with the acoustic version from `Pt. 1'. `Love Kills' adds that edginess that sets Robyn apart from her former self. It is brilliantly controlled, with a pulsating beat that will send shivers, and the way that Robyn sinks her teeth into the dark side of love is splendidly realized here.  Personally, `In My Eyes' is a tad generic, `We Dance to The Beat' lacks a little heart and `U Should Know Better' is a little uninspired, considering the collaboration with Snoop Dogg (the song is fun, but it just doesn't reach the heights it should have).The omissions from the actual singular album are UNFORGIVABLE here.  `Include Me Out' is stellar and should have been here.  It's one of the best tracks from `Pt. 2', as is `Criminal Intent'.  They also don't include the version of `Indestructible' here as well.  Again, this was a bad decision.  They include the version from `Pt. 3', which is far more club savvy, but this orchestral ballad should have been the version included, as it is far better.Part 3...Every track from `Pt. 3' is included here (as should be expected) and in the end I would have rather seen them exclude tracks like `Stars 4-Ever' for some of the better tracks omitted from the first two albums, but then again, I own all three `parts' so it doesn't really effect me.The redone version of `Indestructible' (the closing track to `Body Talk Pt. 2') gets the album (or EP) opened on a great note. I loved the original version (which I still prefer), but this version is totally club ready and more in line with what we expect from Robyn. It's a strong and catchy way to get the album up and going. `Time Machine' is even better. The whole concept of the song is superb. The backing chants are a great touch; the lyrics are a nice look at a common occurrence and the way Robyn delivers everything is spot on. I love the way the chorus almost feels like a different song. It is so bubbly and catchy and the verse structure has a more straightforward and darker tone. They are perfect compliments!  `Call Your Girlfriend' is my favorite track on the album. It is mellow for Robyn (despite what you may think, she does mellow VERY well) but it has her signature edge that elevates the track, and her soft vocals are stunningly effective.  And then there are the last two tracks.  `Get Myself Together', while very good, isn't anything compared to the greatness of `Time Machine' (it also feels a tad too familiar), and `Stars 4-Ever' is just kind of bad.For those of you interested, here is my ranking of the album as a whole:1) Call Your Girlfriend2) Dancehall Queen3) Fembot4) Love Kills5) Dancing on My Own6) Time Machine7) None of Dem8) Hang With Me9) Indestructible10) Don't Tell Me What To Do11) Get Myself Together12) In My Eyes13) U Should Know Better14) We Dance to the Beat15) Stars 4-EverAs you can probably guess, I strongly advice spending a little extra money and buying all three parts separately, but if you want to just get this one album know that it is still worth it and certainly contains a worthy admission to the Robyn discography.\n", "val": 0.006780500989407301}

{"text": "Prime Cuts: Sleep with Me, If I Was a Girl, I Didn'tC-cups, push-up bras and putting meat on those bones are topics you don't hear about or lest even mention over country radio.  But nothing seems sanitized when it comes to Australian songbird Sherrie Austin.  This is precisely what sets Austin out in the sea of female artists that sing about issues facing today's women.  \"Circus Girl\" is Austin's first album in 8 years since her last Broken Arrow effort \"Streets of Heaven.\"  But she has never been lethargic.  Over this hiatus from recording, Austin has honed her pen by co-penning songs for some of country's biggest stars including \"Shotgun Rider\" for Tim McGraw, \"Starting Fires\" for Blake Shelton, and \"Where Have You Been All My Life\" for George Strait.  As a result, the songs on this disc (which are mostly co-written by Austin) are cleverer in their wittier moments and richer emotionally on the more contemplative times.  Teaming again with Will Rambeaux who acts again as her co-writer (on numerous cuts) and co-producer, Austin wraps her girlish Pam Tillis vocal curls around what is perhaps her best disc since \"Words.\"In some sense, \"Circus Girl\" showcases Austin as a refulgent writer. Here she offers her own versions of 4 of her co-writes formerly recorded.  Most tantalizing of this quartet of songs is \"I Didn't.\" A track formerly cut by Trick Pony & Kristen Chenoweth, \"I Didn't\" is cleverly worded analysis of the deterioration of a relationship with the biting line:  \"Yeah, what tore our love apart was a matter of religion, he really loved himself a lot, he thought he was god and I didn't.\"  \"Tryin' to Be Me,\" formerly cut by Melanie Denard, couches a wizened tale of how the mistakes in life helped shaped our identity deserves wide airplay.  In this world of challenging relationships, Emily West's \"That Kind of Happy\" strikes a chord of realism where Austin finally throws in the towel on a roller coaster type relationship.  Not quite as stellar is Danielle Peck's minor hit \"Bad for Me,\" a track written by Austin and Rambeaux, is a sad pop-country entry about loving an unfaithful dud.Of the newly penned songs, \"Sleep with Me\" is in a class of its own.  A plaintive piano ballad about the departure of a no-good paramour, Austin wonders how she's going to \"sleep\" with herself after the breakup.  The emotions are intense and Austin's delivery is right from the heart.  \"Get Your Leavin' Done\" has an adulated big band- soul feel to it calling to mind what Ronnie Milsap used to do so well.  While \"If I Was a Man\" is a fantasy number whereby Austin details the type of girls she would like if she were a man.  Again the wit of \"If I Was a Man\" trumps on Austin's careful attention paid to her conscious litany of wants.  The title cut \"Circus Girl\" is a hook laden small town love story between a \"lost boy\" and a \"circus girl\" with dreams far too big for reality.  Austin revisits her biggest hit to date \"Streets of Heaven\" again, this time giving it a more cherubic rendition about a girl's struggles with a life threatening illness.  This is inspiration at its sonic best.The album closes with \"Naughty or Nice\" - a newly penned Christmas tune that titillates towards a jocund and sensual side in the likes of \"Baby, It's Cold Out There.\"  Frankly, there is little to facult here on what is Austin's best disc in years.  Maybe because she's financing this effort out of her own pockets, there are certainly no fillers here.  Each track is like a little child here--unique and satisfying.  Indeed these 13 cuts have brought Austin back to the centre of the circus' ring again.\n", "val": 0.004441406112164259}
{"text": "It's been more than eight years since Australia-to-Nashville transplant Sherri Austin released her last solo album. She's been busy in the interim starring in Broadway musicals (including Bonnie & Clyde and Ring of Fire: The Johnny Cash Musical Show) and writing songs for Blake Shelton (\"Startin' Fires\"), George Strait (\"Where Have I Been All My Life\") and Tim McGraw & Faith Hill (\"Shotgun Riders\"). She also spent time rethinking the writing she did for herself, and began penning songs expressly aimed at her like-aged forty-something female fans. Many of her songs (several of which were recorded previously by other artists) address unrequited desire, both humorously, with the romantic incompatibility of \"I Didn't\" and datelessness of \"If I Was a Man,\" and introspectively in the search for self of \"Tryin' to Be Me.\" There's romantic discord, both in-process and fully digested into spiteful recrimination, but it's Austin's ability to dramatize every day details and wrap them in modern-pop flavored country that will appeal to \"Friday Night Girls.\" She fits into a growing group of female country songwriters, including Matraca Berg and Suzy Bogguss, whose post-radio careers are proving a fertile perch from which to write songs for their peers, rather than for Music Row. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

{"text": "I heard excerpts from this album during an interview with Lila Downs on public radio, and thought it sounded wonderful, so I ordered a copy of the \"burned to order\" CD.  The content of the CD is of a high quality, and I was not disappointed in that regard.  Two aspects of the purchase were, however, disappointing.  The \"set list\" as it appears on a monitor, when one is playing the CD, is not that of \"Pecados y Milagros,\" but that of \"Una Sangre/One Blood,\" a different album by Downs.  This makes it difficult to select a favorite track, as the title shown will be something completely different.  In addition, although Downs is a Spanish language artist, she is billed as \"Mexican-American\" and it would make sense in this increasingly polyglot world to provide at least minimal liner notes in English, but the entire printed insert is monolingual Spanish.  Since so much of Downs's chosen repertory has socially relevant context, I should think she would be anxious to involve Anglophones in her causes, of which they might be ignorant, but this does not appear to be one of her priorities.  It's really rather surprising, after hearing the interview which originally drew my attention to the artist to uncover this bar to cross-border understanding.  In short, while Downs is a consummate artist, talented songwriter, and elegant, smoky-voiced singer, and while the album is comprised of sensitive, emotive, and thought-provoking material, my pleasure in it was dampened by the erroneous on-disc set list and the absence of any English text at all to clarify the liner notes.\n", "val": 7.619091775268316e-05}

The lyrics are fun, profound, and even a little quirky from one song to the next.  Lila Downs has a style all her own and this CD is really all that is great about that style.  A delightful mix of traditional and pop, and an equally wonderful mix of lyrics drawn on Mexican folk legends and modern day life.  I am not a Spanish native speaker, but the quality of her writing, the clarity of her singing, and just a little help from a couple translation websites makes this music thoroughly enjoyable even if your Spanish is quite limited.\n", "val": 0.05203323811292648}

Her voice transports me to a place of love and mundane transcendence. Her rendition of Tu Carcel is both melancholic and nostalgic which brings me to tears every time I hear it. Xochipitzahua is so beautiful it is reminiscent of Ave Maria and will give you goose bumps. Zapata Se Queda is both fun to dance and meaningful in its message. Lila beautifully renders homage to the sacred process of employing the Comal to make the food which nourishes us, and to the amazing women whose hands work over the sacred comal in Palomo Del Comalito. And what more is there to say about all the other beautiful, artistic, heavenly songs she sings in this fantastic album, they are all simply beautiful. Bravo Lila, keep up your God given work.

This honestly is the best over-all CD that I have heard in any genre in at least 3 years, maybe longer.The songs say how it is, how it was, and how I wish that it had been. There is a song that makes me want to laugh out loud every time I hear it. If I had lived the song Better Stories any more, I really would not have survived,My family had the dining room where we ate all meals together. It was where we communicated with each other. Craig uses the song The Whole World Needs a Kitchen as his family room. Too much truth in this song, especially since I have let my family drift away from family time.More Trucks Than Cars. Well, it's a party in the South! What would you expect?If you are a person who grew up or knows about the country, you will understand the song Country Boy Like Me. If you have ever felt lucky or blessed or like someone is looking out for you, you will understand. Good song!Show Me Your Tattoos. ;-) Nuff said.Cancer is never a popular topic. Losing someone you love is never easy. Everybody handles it differently. If it matters, I understand the song I Didn't Drink.Fish Weren't Bitin' is a great mutual seduction song. I'm smiling as I think about it. Very cool song.Corn Star is a tribute to those wonderful country girls.Everybody needs a good ballad. The4 song Summer Moon is the best ballad on this CD. For me it ranks up with Magnolia by JJ Cale and for me THAT is a heck of a statement.Being Alive and Living is a celebration of making time and doing what makes you happy.Love Loves a Long Night. Well, use your imagination..........AND now the title song, This Ole Boy sets the tone for it all. The whole CD starts with a great song and gets better.I am not exaggerating, this is a well put together CD musically and lyrically. Craig has out done himself.

Once dubbed,  \" country music's champion of the Everyman\"  he is best known for monster hits that espouse  the core  values f the genre:  Faith, \" That's What I Love About Sunday\", good times,  \"Redneck Yacht Club\" and helping others,  \"Almost Home\" We get much of the same on \"This Ole Boy,\" his first new music in three years and debut with Black River Entertainment. Disappointingly, the patriotism, religion and love thy neighbor themes are buried deep in songs so laden with redneck stereotypes, you expect to see Gretchen Wilson credited somewhere in the liner notes.

I'm at a point in my life where I'm extremely comfortable.  Extremely confident. I feel good about my family, friends, and my career. Looking back, I think the songs I picked reflect that.\" They certainly do. Every track (he co-wrote 7 of the 12) is right in his down home country boy wheel house.

But you can get many better collections here on Amazon for a better value.  It left me disappointed.In general, classical music is a great accompaniment for reading.  I use it to soften the mood at home and at work, where I read and write for most of my day.  What one ideally wants to avoid are surprising loud crescendos and fast energetic works that can sometimes distract you from what you are reading or working on.  Unfortunately, too many tracks chosen for this collection fit that category.Some of the most recognizable pieces from classical music are compiled here.  Schubert's Ave Maria is presented here nicely.  Brahms' Waltz #15 (Opus 39) will sound familiar even to those who don't listen to classical music.  And of course you have the oft-overworked pieces from Debussy's \"Clair De Lune\" and Pachebel's \"Canon In D.\"  Handel's \"Largo\" and \"Serenade\" are both also very recognizable and pleasing to the ear.  But so many tracks fit into those categories that this devolves into a \"greatest hit\" collection instead of a carefully crafted compilation.They did make some nice surprising choices here.  The prelude from Wagner's Lohengrin is perfect for such a collection.  Massenet's \"Thais Meditation\" blends in nicely, as does Debussy's \"Nuages.\"  And Albioni's Adagio in G Minor is another choice I enjoyed, where the dramatic moments are nuanced instead of jarring.By the time you get to Strauss Jr.'s \"Wine, Women & Song\" with cymbals crashing, it becomes clear that this compilation was not made with reading in mind.  That fact is punctuated by the Adagio from Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Lizst's Liebestraume #3 is perhaps a little more energetic than I would ideally like in such a compilation.  And \"L'Arlesienne Intermezzo from Suite Number 2\" by Bizet is at times lovely and at other times ominous to my ear.  But Schubert's \"Trout\" quintet's frenetic piano solos make it distracting despite starting out soft and soothing.  Even much loved works, like the \"Spring\" movement from Vivaldi's Four Seasons and the \"Morning\" movement from Peer Gynt, are full of too many dramatic moments to make them ideal for such a collection.CONCLUSIONIf you want an affordable collection of classical music, this is an acceptable choice.  But you will get a much better value with an alternative like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rise-of-the-Masters-100-Supreme-Classical-Masterpieces/dp/B005VZRBR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rise of the Masters: 100 Supreme Classical Masterpieces</a>. Even picking one of the composer specific collections, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bach-100-Supreme-Classical-Masterpieces-Rise-of-the-Masters/dp/B005WW94ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bach - 100 Supreme Classical Masterpieces: Rise of the Masters</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Brahms-100-Supreme-Classical-Masterpieces-Rise-of-the-Masters/dp/B005W26TVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Brahms - 100 Supreme Classical Masterpieces: Rise of the Masters</a>&nbsp;is probably acceptable.  In my opinion, this compilation has too many dramatic and distracting moments to be ideal for reading.  If you don't mind reading to the boisterous symphonic movements included here, you certainly won't mind anything in any of those collections.  And they provide much more musical value.  This is still worth getting, but I highly recommend you don't get it for the purpose of reading.Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.006835619919002056}

It was great on parent visit night to hear the entire group of children singing this song at the top of their lungs.

He is usually a non singer but not with this song, if he hears it, he sings along.  The NEWSBOYS were always our family favorite group and we wondered where the new sound with the group would go.

{"text": "The first time I heard this I really loved the song because the reference to Jesus as the Lion of Judah. \"He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion... He's roaring like a lion!\" Often people think of Jesus as some sort of milksop who is so eager to please that he will let them trample him under foot. This is not the case. Jesus is the Almighty. None can stand against him. He is mighty to save! He will roar like a lion, driving away the wicked and protecting the righteous under his care. The Lord is mightier than man: \"he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.\"The lyrics bring to mind the song Miriam (Moses' sister) sang about the Lord's victorious triumph over Pharaoh. Love this song!Isa. 31:4 - Like as the lion... so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.Hosea 5:14 - They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.Rev. 5:5 Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed!\n", "val": 0.009006254374980927}

Lyrically it is both soothing and uplifting, spiritual and relational.  Excellent!Walk Out of the Rain - I'm madly in love with this song.  It has such a rich, old-country, George Strait vibe.  As a Texas girl at heart, there ain't nothin' better than a George Strait vibe - unless its done by Sawyer Brown.  Smooth, two-stepping, hold your partner close kinda country.  Gotta love it.Cool Night - Speaking of smooth - it's like butter on your breakfast toast.  When the cd Six Days on the Road came out I was so tingly surprised by how suited the band was to cover This Night Won't Last Forever - Cool Night feels the exact same way.Ain't Going Out That Way - Lets talk anthem songs. I had heard Sawyer Brown do this live a couple of times and absolutely adored it.  I love the whole concept of this song.Y'all Ready - Yea babeeee!  Classic Sawyer Brown.  Talk about dancin your donkey off!Along those same lines, let's include New Set of Tires as classic SB.  It easily rivals Race and Some Girls.Come Along - Ernie Haas and Signature Sound - such a nice touch.  I grew up on southern gospel - my dad and grandfather sang in gospel quartets.  It's like coming home for me.  The vocals layering is rich and textured.  If you loved Mission Temple - you'll love Come Along.And, there simply are no words for Travelin' Band.  Most. Amazing. Song. Ever. Period.\n", "val": 0.037771593779325485}
{"text": "Charts, schmarts. What charts or not is not an indicator of quality, only popularity: weak music sells all the time. This effort, on the other hand, is Sawyer Brown's best album to date, bar none. If there is a weak cut, it's maybe the cover of \"Cool Night,\" but that's it (and please note the \"maybe\"). The songs Mark and Hobie wrote for this one are great and their writing just gets better and better. This band did not start on Star Search. They were playing clubs for a couple of years before that show was even a gleam in Ed McMahon's eye. Did it help them at the time? sure. But they're still playing many, many dates through each year (34 years into it and 30 years post Star Search) and are still one of the best bands to see live. If you're on the fence about \"Travelin' Band,\" fall off it and land on the \"Buy\" button, right now!\n", "val": 0.020443346351385117}

It may even get me out to a tent revival!!  Track 6 is also very good. After that it drops off quickly to the other nine tracks which are in the average to above average range. On a plus side there are no duds. All have merit.  As a negative the jewel insert is trite. There is nothing besides the funky front sheet and a track listing. The publisher earns an F.

The happy, tappy, shake your tailfeather songs (Come Along and Ya'll Ready).  The easy, breazy, let's just chill songs (Cool Night, Deliver Me).  The sensitive, tender, gonna make you think songs(Walk Out of the Rain).Then there is the quintessential Sawyer Brown - Travelin' Band.  What a wonderful tribute.  The poignancy of the title track reminds me over and over why I love their music.

{"text": "Note this review is about the music on \"If It's So\" not this particular CD release, which is apparently not official or at least well recorded.Frank Zappa once said (I'm paraphrasing), \"Rock criticism is written by writers who can't write, about muscians who can't play, for people who can't read.\" Much of the rock criticism from that era completely missed the mark, and overlooked great bands like this one. Note how Rolling Stone has \"re-written\" many of their reviews of now recognized classics such as \"After The Gold Rush\", etc. Black Sabbath was dismissed as \"junk rock\", but I'd be hard pressed to find anyone now who won't recgnize Iommi's brilliant guitar riffs and playing on \"Supernaut\" or \"Tomorrow's Dream\". I digress.These great muscians from Long Island made funk rock, hard rock, blues rock and soul harmonies a big part of the Illusion sound on their first two releases. However, songs like  \"You Make Me What I Am\", \"Run, Run, Run\", \"Happy Days\", and \"Angel\" from the first two Illusion albums are not funk rock, and sound similar to songs on their final and greatest (in my opinion) album.Which bring me to \"If It's So\". The Side 2 \"suite\" advances the muscianship, songwriting, harmony, and melodic sensibility of the group. They had matured as artists. I think \"If It's So\" is less dated than a lot of the more popular bands of that era. Both sides of \"If It's So\" hold up today. These guys could play, sing and write songs. My only regret is that I never saw them perform.I won't argue whether the \"Five Song Suite\" on Side 2 it is better than \"Did You See Her Eyes\", but consider this: the chorus and guitar at the 3:30 mark of \"DYSHE\" is highly derivative of Sly and the Family Stone. I love Sly, and I also really like \"Did You See Her Eyes\".  But \"Collection-If It's So-Life Cycle Theme-Dr. Stone-Recuverdas De Alhambra\" from \"If It's So\" are an original five song cycle, and one of the great album sides from 1970, possibly from that entire era.\"Achoo\" has indicated this is not an official release, or is a poorly made one, which is too bad.

{"text": "Wow! I have now listened to the whole album five times straight through and some of my favorite tracks over and over again. This is lyrical theology at its best and in my opinion is Shai Linne's best album yet, which I thought would have been impossible after Atonement. Granted, I need more time to make a statement like this, but at this time my thought is that this may simply be the best single album ever made.Shai Linne's rapping is understandable and theologically accurate, and most importantly worship-inspiring. Each track focuses on an attribute of God. This means that from beginning to end the focus is on God. How refreshing! And the theology is presented in such a way that I find myself praising God for who he is, often in tears of worship, adoration, repentance, and devotion. The album seriously plays like a good book or sermon set to rhythm and music.Shai Linne is not near as lyrically complex as some HHH rappers, but the simplicity is far from childish and instead makes his message easily understood and reflected upon. I have found that the result is that few rappers are able to consistently move my heart to worship God like Shai Linne. His lines and beats are brought in such a way that I never go away saying, \"Wow, what a rapper,\" but rather \"Amazing God!\"The music and beats are very good. As one of the other reviewers pointed out, the hooks and the beats are not the best. This album will not make the best \"background music\" or \"mindless music\". The lyrics carry the album not the beats. That said, I really do enjoy musical aspect of the album. It is very well done and enjoyable--I think the best Shai has done yet--but sometimes a bit repetitive. The lyrics do carry the day with this album and the music is a good and appropriate complement.I cannot recommend The Attributes of God too highly.\n", "val": 0.046287234872579575}

{"text": "I strongly recommend you listen to all the samples before buying.  i tend to go with my educated hunch and buy albums I expect to be amazing.  Shai Linne's last album amazed me in the legacy of his successes for the Kingdom however this album let me down TREMENDOUSLY.The Word is as solid as any Shai Linne album but the passion feels far from the beats and overall reception.  The tracks I like are amazing just as expected but the many tracks i dislike are so simplistic it almost feels like what I would hear if my 50 year old dad decided he would \"all of a sudden\" make hip hop.I wasn't diggin any of the songs with the kids choirs(seemed like a good idea but wasnt, artistically, in my opinion) nor did many of the hooks seem well thought out(you know if you asked a 5 year old to make a hook how it might sound SUPER simple?  Thats how many of the hooks felt).Im sure many people will try and religiously look at me like Im the devil for having an unreligious, authentic, Kingdom minded(honest construction) opinion.  I mean we don't hire Christians to do brain surgury but we hire QUALIFIED surgeons and pray that they are of the Kingdom even for their own sake.So outside of false encouragement, from one honest adult to another , I admit I will not be listening to many of these tracks again.  Who knows...maybe the tracks will grow on me however I doubt that my \"earbuds\" will thirst for more bland artistry.  Best track on the album is the solo by Timothy Brindle in my opinion.Bottom line: Most of the beats are unbearably lame in my opinion and unfortunately the sharp theology and far too repetitious lyricism was not able to redeem those tracks. The good tracks however are traditional Shai Linne richness.  The album feels real ambitious yet I don't feel like God's attributes are done much justice nor Shai Linne's capabilities.  im glad i bought this for the sake of supporting the preaching of the gospel and I hope many people disagree with me AUTHENTICALLY for that sake alone.Artistically however, i will be more on my toes because this has happened to me before(with Trip Lee's last album among other people) and I found myself very disappointed by the artists I esteemed \"SUPER INSPIRING\" and effective in using art to win over the minds of listeners for the Kingdom.  I pray all the Lampmode artists be encouraged but on the real:  I am looking forward to Json and Hazakim's new joints(because they are among the very few who seem to be getting better instead of losing the skill that merits results).If the samples give you the same feeling as me, look into your heart and if you have the money, please support your Christian brother.  if you dont, please wait for some low quality Youtube videos to pop up in which you can hear the full songs once and call it a day.  Shai Linne's 1st and 3rd albums however are MUST BUYS in the HHH community with MANY powerful tracks guaranteed to stir the mind of the unbeliever and backslider.  Please support and encourage him in his efforts for the Lord and the Kingdom.\n", "val": 0.00013934347953181714}

{"text": "If I'm going to review a rap album, I should probably come clean up front:  I'm a white guy in my mid-thirties, which means I probably don't have much credibility when it comes to analyzing rap or hip-hop.  However, I will also say that I've had a long running closet fascination with rap music, and I own more rap CD's than I would want to admit to my friends.  I also haven't liked admitting it to my church, because I've always thought that the best rap came from some of the most secular artists.  I'm happy to say that has now changed!In my opinion, Shai Linne is not just the best Christian rapper, but one of the best rappers period.  He is the first Christian rap artist I have found who does not let me down lyrically, stylistically, or both.  His lyrics are substantial, his rhymes intricate and multi-faceted, his alliteration alluring, and his theology impeccable.  I feel like I am back in seminary listening to his music, because the theology is deep and hard hitting.  And yet I can listen to it again and again, and each time through appreciate a different aspect of how the song is put together poetically and rhythmically.The most impressive feat, by far, on this album, is that every song is radically Christ-centered.  Each track focuses on a different aspect of the character of God, and every single one relates its attribute to the work of Christ on the cross on our behalf.  This would seem easy with a track about God's love, but he does the same thing with the tracks about his wrath, justice, faithfulness, jealously, etc.  I highly commend this album to both your ears and your soul.\n", "val": 0.020783953368663788}
{"text": "Truly, I did not know what took me so long to buy Shai linne's album.  It is ridiculous how knowledgeable this man is theologically and biblically and how spiritually gifted he is.  This project is a perfect description of God's attributes; God is worshipped, magnified and his Sovereignty is highly and clearly preached in this album.  This album helps remind me of the fact that we tend to diminish God's standards once our vision gets blurry because of temporary circumstancial barriers that don't seem to move out of our way, but this project clearly helps us realize WHO we are dealing with, HE IS the Alpha and Omega, no matter the degree of what we are facing HE's still THE ALMIGHTY and SOVEREIGN GOD.  Nevertheless, what a way to deliver the message through powerful and intriguing lyrical contexts with the hottest beats and melodies.  This guy does not sound like any other christian rappers out there, which makes him stand out unique in his God's glorifying journey.  If you'll ask me? Don't even second guess, this album a MUST HAVE, from the first to the last song, it will totally renew your perspectives, if not remind you about The ATTRIBUTES of GOD. And you will truly be blessed!\n", "val": 0.028740813955664635}

There is great variety, and the songs get better with time. I am new to Hip-Hop/Rap, but I can at least say that this blows away all other \"Christian\" music that I've listened to before. My family is enjoying learning these songs together-- it's a new thing for us, but it is so exciting to learn about God's attributes together. Thank you, Shai Linne and the others who put this together, for all the work you put into this for the glory of God!\n", "val": 0.011344426311552525}
{"text": "For much of my unsaved life I was a big fan of hip hop. I listened to all the famous rappers and knew nearly every line. When God saved me, one of the things that changed was my dislike for worldly music that did not give him honor. So when I first heard of Christian rap I was a little skeptical given my past obsession with that kind of music.But I can truly say that this CD by Shai Linne has been a tremendous encouragement and edifying for my soul. Not only is this CD filled with fascinating lyrics and awesome beats, it is also easy to understand what is being said.What is it about these lyrics that are so good? Shai Linne gives us a biblical perspective on who God is and what God has done. God is beautiful, holy, glorious, patient, loving, faithful, etc.  God is also gracious in pouring out his grace and mercy to us who have sinned against him. So  we can now get to know this God because of the work of the triune God in saving us.I believe if you will listen and digest this CD about our glorious God you perhaps will learn more about God than most people who sit in church for a lifetime under shallow teaching.Personal favorites: Faithful God, Mercy and Grace, and the Lord of Patience.\n", "val": 0.017325492575764656}

There are even some tracks that I pray will make it to the mainstream. I know that Christian Hip Hop artists rarely get exposure in this dark world, especially guys like shai, brindle, christcentric, lampmode, etc. This album offers something for everyone, while bringing God Glory as well as keeping it theologocial.

{"text": "All week long I've been listening to Shai Linne's newest album, The Attributes of God. I can't recommend it highly enough! I've long been a fan of his \"lyrical theology\", and his latest project continues to raise the bar for excellence in that area. \"Attributes\" has taken a huge leap forward musically as well. In a recent interview, the artist said he was \"looking for an overall sound that was epic and cinematic, like a film score\". He has certainly succeeded in that regard. Each track has a very different feel, providing significant musical contrast and interest, while the album flows seamlessly together as a whole.The theme of the album is, as the title suggests, the attributes of God. Linne walks us through the list of characteristics which God revealed about himself in Exodus 33:18-34:14. Each song explores one or more of the attributes, arranged in the same order that the LORD gave them to Moses.Even if hip-hop is not your usual favorite genre, I encourage you to check out this album and others like it. The genre lends itself particularly well to exposition, as it allows for many more words than most song forms. And if you think you don't like hip-hop, I'm convinced that the more you listen to it, the more it will grow on you! I'm also thankful for Shai Linne's clarity of articulation: I can understand every word he says... which is not always the case among rappers!The theme used to summarize this album was \"Do You Know Him?\" I can think of few better ways to get to know \"the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom [He has] sent\" (John 17:3) than listening to \"The Attributes of God\".Soli Deo Gloria\n", "val": 0.019733309745788574}
{"text": "This album is an awesome and true expose of the one and only Triune God!  Through this offering Shai and all contributors did an excellent job of depicting the High and Lofty One in His true position as the Matchless Creator and putting man in his place as a sinner completely lost without God's grace, yet eternally hopeful as that grace is extended via His Son Jesus Christ.  If you love God's character, person, holiness, justice, grace, mercy and truth then you'll love this album.  If you think that God is here to serve us and is obligated to bend to our carnal cravings or that He is persuaded by the will of man, then you'll probably hate this album.  Also, from a lyricist standpoint and raw rap talent, this album is par excellence.  I've listened to some Christian rap artists and gotten the feeling that because they were rapping about the Lord that ensuring the lyrics and delivery were on point didn't matter.  I'm pleased to say that such is far from the case here or for any music from Lamp Mode for that matter.  I would put this album up against any secular hip hop artist anyday!  Hmmmmmm.....let's see, true spiritual substance which is able to incite the listener towards salvation, worship, adoration and holiness with excellence of skill vs. secular garabage with zero talent which only serves to rot the soul.Check the Attributes of God ya'll: the lowercase m.c. exalting the uppercase L-O-R-D!!!

{"text": "Oh my God. I have been waiting forever (like 5 years) for Girls' Generation aka SNSD (Leader: Taeyeon, Yoona, Tiffany, Jessica, Sunny, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Seohyun)to come out with an English song and I miss their debut by like 3 months. What kind of fan am I? I absolutely adore these 9 girls and quite simply, idolize them. From the very beginning with their Korean debut \"Into a New World\" to their international sensation \"Gee\" in 2009 in Korean and 2010 in Japanese, Girls' Generation have challenged their music industry over and over again. Selected at very young ages for training (I think as young as 9 years old), the girls have lived together, trained together, choreographed their dances, singing, everything together this past decade, yet maintained their separate and unique personalities. They are variety show hosts, they are variety show stars, they are very busy and hardworking with an unbelievable work ethic. With Jessica and Tiffany as American born, the group has a slight edge in reaching out to the American music industry in terms of translation in composing their songs.The Boys showcase Girl's Generation at the current height of their fame and popularity. Not as cute as they were in \"Gee\", this song, especially the video, shows the girls as strong young women, pushing the edge on sexiness and glamour without going overboard. They look elegant, not trashy. The song itself contains all the different elements they have used in the past: strong vocals, especially from their leader Taeyeon and the other two strong singers: Tiffany and Jessica with the increasingly impressive Seohyun ; the use of synth and electronic elements; rap, changes in the beat and type of the song midsong, and amazing dancing. The girls do about 2 to 3 performances per day when they are not hosting shows, touring, doing variety shows, or commercials, so the dance steps are not as complicated as they could be, since the day Jessica fainted in their performances from the exhaustion of multiple performances on the same day in a 90 degrees stuffy gym. That's why I'm super impressed with the dancing for this song in their music video.The girls are between the ages of 20 and 22. Yoona is the face of SNSD, and quite frankly, the face of Asia. There is no other perfection like her in terms of looks, personality, confidence, and sweetness. Taeyeon is the leader and the best vocalist. Jessica and Tiffany are also amazing with their vocals. Seohyun is the youngest, but budding as a top vocalist. Sunny has the most experience in the industry, and aside from being cute and the growing stronger vocals, is the protective one of the bunch. Sooyoung and Yuri are the most beautiful girls in the group, in my opinion, they also have the most interesting personalities, being practical jokers. Hyoyeon is by far the best dancer in the group. Each girl has their different strengths and they work together like a perfect team, as sisters.So, feel the heat! ;) It's warm and friendly, cute and sexy, modest and glamorous. And I hope you enjoy their other songs too. And I wish, I pray, I hope that they will come out with more songs in English!!!! <3\n", "val": 0.0028787776827812195}

{"text": "Let me make one thing very clear: I'm not a Kelly Clarkson fan. Her recent songs (particularly \"Already Gone\") really annoy me due to how the arrangments are put together, her-not-so-phenominal singing technique, and how fans will cheer on even her most repetitive themes. She does have talent, but her music hasn't had the opportunity to show it for a while.This song brought me back a little with Clarkson. The arrangment, while building a little too strongly in the third verse, stars out with a quiet music box theme and a guitar sneaking in. I think this choice was great in portraying that secret, darker thing in the back of your mind, which is what the song is basically about. It's too bad the song has to give into Pop music's temptation to \"rock\" and abandon that softness, but it's still a nice opening and closing. The lyrics are at times a little clich and predictable (particularly \"don't run away, promise you'll stay\") but having a song like this is good for the Pop scene. With every non-romance song being about self-empowerment and overcoming inner conflicts, this song is more like accepting inner demons and asking someone to stand by you even with them. It's about living with the bad and moving onward, rather than abandoning the bad for good, and to me, that rings stronger than your average, light-hearted song out there. It certainly is a nice change of pace from Clarkson's break-up-but-coming-back material.\n", "val": 0.006877128034830093}

{"text": "When it has came down to Kelly Clarkson, she honestly hasn't had very strong songs, since her first few records. While she has had the most success from her American Idol days a decade ago, she has had a few songs that don't really show a drive in the ballad. Her latest song Dark Side, the third song from her latest album Stronger, isn't actually as driven as a the songs she had done before. The chorus of the song feels a bit oversung from Kelly, and not as driven from the voice alone. I really didn't find the song to be all of Kelly as she showed before. Maybe, when Kelly Clarkson comes out with new music soon, something will come along to a brighter side.Song: C\n", "val": 3.765603105421178e-05}

{"text": "This is without a doubt one of the best duets I've listened to in recent history. Both Jason Aldean and Kelly Clarkson did an amazing job with this song. Jason and Kelly make a beautiful and harmonious recording pair in this song. Their voices and the lyrics and music to this song linger on in your head long after the song has ended. And I NEVER get tired listening to this song. I have Jason's \"My Kinda Party\" CD playing in my car, and it's a great album. There's a reason why Jason's album and \"Don't You Wanna Stay\" have been #1 on the country album and country song/country radio airplay charts, respectively for many weeks. Watch Jason and Kelly's 2010 CMA Awards \"Don't You Wanna Stay\" live performance (you can view it on CMT, YouTube, etc.). Both Jason and Kelly sang with their heart and soul, both in the recorded version, and in the live version. Their \"Don't You Wanna Stay\" performance was honestly one of the best live duets I've seen in a long while. I give a big thumbs up to this song!\n", "val": 0.03835497796535492}

I was not surprised by it, but after Mr. Know It All, I had expected better from Kelly's music.

For me, Faces is the exception to that rule.  I listen to EVERY song EVERY time!  Neil proves his talent several times over with catchy tunes such as Captain Lane and title song Pale Blue Jak and smooth melodies with songs such as D-13 and Candlestick.  There are a few surprises, Neil's take on Bruno Mars' hit Grenade for one and Neil's own Paperboy.  Neil does show his sensitive soul with Life I Once Had and Lost and Tender, two beautiful songs that can easily make you cry after the head-bobbing prior tunes .

For a special treat be sure to get the Celtic Thunder Christmas DVD available here on Amazon. When Neil lays down the guitar and dons his jacket to begin singing \"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" I thought WOW, this isn't just another Christmas album. Their version of \"Amazing Grace\" is one of the best I have ever heard.\n", "val": 0.004276593681424856}

There are many fine recordings. One that springs to mind is a live Horowitz recording of L'Isle Joyeuse, which is very exciting.  Ivan Moravec is also a great Debussy player - and his recordings are available in decent sound.For the orchestral works the Boulez recordings with Cleveland (both the older releases on Columbia/Sony and the later DGG recordings) offer great detail and balance.  There's a beautiful new recording by Nezet-Seguin/Montreal of La Mer that I have on SACD and recommend highly. Karajan did a couple of spectacular Debussy recordings on DGG.You must have a recording of the great Debussy string quartet. It's frequently paired with the amazing Ravel quartet, which is also a must.  I have never found a recording of this piece that entirely satisfies me.  I've heard some great performances of it in concert.  But certainly there are many worthwhile recordings.  I wish the wonderful Chiara String Quartet would record it.

I tend to fall asleep to this music as well. I am a hermit and I have no friends or family so I welcome the music. It is comforting, soothing, and invigorating. I do have one complaint = You're paying for 100 tracks and they separate each \"piece\" by their movements and count each movement as a track. frankly it should be 100 individual masterpieces, it is a bit misleading. I have noted that most of these collections are made up in that format or they only play a single movement of the piece.On the flip side of this, I prefer this one over the ones that split it and only play one part of the piece. for example the sonatas I'll take the Sonata no. 12 in F Major for Piano as a prime example: It isn't a sonata without the other two movements. That is part of the sonata form without it you have no \"sonata.\" A suite has multiple parts and same with a symphony you can't just leave one section out for one portion. It would be like boasting a great collection of movies but only playing part of the movie through in favor of fitting more in.I highly recommend this album. I would absolutely die if I couldn't hear the full sonata no 12 in F Major. It didn't become a masterpiece just by a small excerpt, it was the full piece they considered. Otherwise, we would have millions of masterpieces. It could be a couple decibels louder on some pieces. To remedy this, I just stick my phone or tablet on my wooden desk to increase the level. An easy fix.\n", "val": 0.010906780138611794}

{"text": "If you need to fill holes in your Mozart collection, or you're looking to replace that lost or broken CD.  Or, if you've never bought a Mozart CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by the greatest composer of all time.  There's the Jupiter Symphony and his Requiem Mass among others.  Between the piano pieces, the chamber music, the orchestral pieces, then orchestral with choir, everything is fully covered.  This is music at it's best!  Mozart was clearly a genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for relaxing, meditation, or as the background for your life.  It's simply beautiful!FOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong, even if some aren't perfectly executed.FOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself. At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussy.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!

{"text": "I'm not the biggest fan of Handel (he always seems to be \"Bach Lite\" to me), but I figured that for $1.99 this would give me a good sampling of one of the Baroque masters. Before buying this collection, I only had \"The Messiah\" in my collection, although I was familiar with most of the works in this collection. The performances in this collection are particularly excellent, for the most part. I really enjoyed Suzuki's \"Messiah,\" which had a surprisingly organic feel to it - probably due to the period instruments being used. There's actually one quick exception to the Messiah's greatness - the Hallelujah Chorus, which is one of the worst versions I have ever heard. It lacked the emotional punch that I'm accustomed to. Otherwise, this is a fine collection at a fantastic price.\n", "val": 0.004362061154097319}
{"text": "Looking at my CD collection it sometimes seems I have every Bach CD produced.  When you look at the other High Baroque master, Handel, well my collection has been rather lacking.  Until now....  Even if I throw out the repeats from my collection (mostly the Messiah) I am still left with perhaps 3 hours of music.  And listening through, the recordings are all relatively high quality.  Maybe not the greatest ever, but I am very happy with them.One of the good things about this collection (besides it only costing 2 bucks) is that most of the music is complete.  What I mean by that is that all movements are included - I hate budget sampler collections that give you the popular movement of a piece but leave the others out.This is a great way to get a large chunk of Handel's music (after Bach the greatest early 18th century composer) in your collection for a very small price.  Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.021366702392697334}
{"text": "These collections are often mixes of the same pieces that have been presented in other low price collections of music on the BIS label. I don't have a lot of these but know that those who do often complain about the duplication. My view on this is that if there are enough new tracks then the packages are usually worth buying.In the case of this Handel release there are some gems that are worth the price of this collection alone. The performance of Handel's Messiah by Masaaki Suzuki and the Bach Collegium of Japan (using authentic instruments)is one example. The tracks included here do not include the opening \"And Without Controversy\" reading from (I Timothy 3 : 16)which often precedes the music in performance,but not always on recordings. It is on the original Suzuki recording though, but I imagine only purists would complain about its absence here when otherwise this is a fine complete performance with both English and Japanese forces (leading at times  to some quaint stresses from the choir) that has been reviewed well elsewhere. Although not the top recommendation it does stand up well, and at this price is certainly worth a place in your collection.Other favourites in this collection are the Concerti Grosso played by Arte de Suonatori under Martin Gester, a Polish Baroque Orchestra, who give fine performances of four of these Concerti fronm their well-received collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Handel-G-Concerto-Grossi-Op-6-Arte-Dei-Suonatori/dp/B002WP1JS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Handel, G.: Concerto Grossi, Op. 6 (Arte Dei Suonatori)</a>. These are stylishly played in an authentic manner with authentic instruments.Another \"authentic\" group are the London Baroque who, apart from a lovely G minor Trio Sonata are joined by top English baroque soprano Dame Emma Kirkby in Handel's short Salve Regina in G minor from the CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Emma-Kirkby-Handel-Sacred-Cantatas-London-Baroque/dp/B00005K2AX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Emma Kirkby - Handel: Sacred Cantatas / London Baroque</a>&nbsp;but not, it seems, otherwise available as a download.

This is sweetly and stylishly played: harpsichord, cello, violin and recorder.We are treated to an Organ Concerto and an Oboe Concerto as well as a couple extracts from pieces - a single oboe concerto movement played with a very full tone by Jiri Krecji(couldn't we have had the whole concerto?), and a single movement from a keyboard piece suite, this one a sarabande based on the \"La Folia\" motif played on piano by Alisa Bratslavskaya. We hear the full G Minor Oboe concerto payed by Krecji and the Slovak Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Bohdan Warchal in a muscular performance that has character and beauty. I like the oboe tone, rich and clear with great fluidity of style in the faster passages.The Organ Concerto (No. 10, Op 7) is played by Harald Feller and the Capella Istrapolitana with Paul Kantschieder, a band well known for some excellent baroque performances on Naxos. This is sensitively played. The opening meditative adagio is an unusual start to a concerto and gets us into a receptive mood for the following movements which then rise to greet the heavens in with some majestic, but not heavy, playing from Herr Feller, a German organist well known for his performances of the German repertoire.A few Handel favourites are represented here by the \"Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\", The Largo from Xerxes, \"Lascia Ch'io pianga\" from Rinaldo as well as the 3 Suites from the \"Water Music\" and \"The Music for the Royal Fireworks\". These latter are well known in various performances, from the grand style to the more recent \"authentic\" styles. Great music like this can cope with being played differently (just check out the different Messiahs), and it is more often a question of taste rather than which is \"best\" in choosing recordings. What collections like this enable us to do is to  hear different perfomances that we may not have chosen but which can still offer new and enlightening interpretations.The \"Water Music\" Suites and the \"Fireworks\" music are played here by the St Petersburg Radio Symphony Orchestra under Stanislav Gorkovenko. From the start I knew I was going to like his Water Music. The the water is deep and has a steady flow, the overture taking us into a collection of movements that are varied and well played. They don't have the sparkle of a Marriner but there is sense of cohesion in the balance of the instruments that may not have been there on a boat on the Thames but suits a recording well. Whilst this is outdoor music it doesn't have to rise above the sounds of boats and waves in our living rooms! Sometimes the performances may seem a bit understated but overall they are enjoyable.The Fireworks Music for me has to compete with Sir Charles Mackerras' performance from the 1960s recorded in the middle of the night with all available players from the London orchestras<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Music-for-the-Royal-Fireworks-Cti-a-Due-Cori/dp/B00006L3X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Music for the Royal Fireworks / Cti a Due Cori</a>. This, of course is the original version for Wind Orchestra for outdoors performance with  fireworks. Here we have the orchestral version with strings which doesn't have the same wall of wind effect of Mackerras' recording. I found the recording and performance more understated than I would like - but well played with verve and style.Handel's Largo always goes down well and this performance by Yoshikazu Mela with the Japan Philharmonic comes across as a pleasant addition to this collection - Mela is a countertenor with a pure voice that rises above the orchestra with a rare beauty. He is also represented in the Messiah presented here so we are treated to a real talent. Countertenors vary in their tone, some are true countertenors - men with a true vocal range, others rely on a falsetto style to take their, often tenor, voices into the upper registers - never quite as satisfactory in my opinion. None these days are \"castrati\", for whom some of their repertoire were composed.All in all, then, an excellent collection of music played with a mix of authentic and modern instrument bands. At the current price you can't go wrong with this.\n", "val": 0.012284324504435062}

{"text": "For obvious reasons, the \"Rise of the Masters\" series of recordings rings with a certain atmosphere of suspiciion - after all, two- and three-dollar prices for a hundred tracks suggests not necessarily a great deal, but more likely a mix of poor recordings.  In some cases, this is at least partially true; the obscure orchestras featured in the Tchaikovsky and Brahsm sets give acceptable, but less-than-stellar performances of their symphonies and the chamber music, while generally well-played, contains recordings from live performances with the occasional interruption by noisy audience members and long applause sections.This set of recordings, however, is a fantastic grouping, for many reasons.  First of all, many of the songs are played by original instruments groups, which are capable of playing the music with a flavor and spectacle modern instruments never good; there is an energy which pervades their recordings which is often lost with modern instruments.So, for the price, and for the quality of the recordings, this is one of the better \"Rise of the Masters\" recordings, and, as they all are, one of the more fantastic deals in music.\n", "val": 0.003297297516837716}

{"text": "Of all the \"Rise of the Masters,\" I have thrown out the most from the Handel disk. Having paid a couple of bucks for it, I don't really mind.Especially good: Messiah Exerpts, anything with Arte de Suonatori, and Emma Kirkby.The worst were the pieces performed by the Slovakian Chamber Orchestra. I have high school memories of their performances on the radio. Being poor, and cheap, I would record pieces onto tape, but even then I would reject that group. Yes, they are just as bad as I remembered.Others that got deleted, Alisa Bratslavskaya's piano rendition of \"La Folia.\" It's a classic case of trying to make a piano sound like a harpsichord, and it comes across wooden. The recording of the Water Music is technically OK, but there are many far better ones out there. The St. Petersburg Radio Symphony Orchestra displays little or no knowledge of Baroque performance practice. Displaying more knowledge, but with a somewhat disappointing performance of the organ concerto is Capella Istropolitana's rendition. It's worth keeping if you have nothing better out there.London Baroque, Ensemble Collegium Musicum, and I Quattro Temperamenti do well, and Yoshikazu Mela and Japan Philharmonic Orchestra do a nice job on their pieces.I must say, though, that one group has impressed me again and again on the various Great Masters baroque composers, the Bach Collegium Japan led by Masaaki Suzuki. I had been vaguely aware of the group before, but their presence on the Handel, Bach, and to a lesser extent the Vivaldi offerings, helps make the series. They need wider exposure, as their performances are never less than first rate.\n", "val": 5.6124874390661716e-05}

At almost 8 and a half hours, it includes many of the polonaises, etudes, mazurkas, waltzes, concerti and sonatas that make up a major portion of Chopin's canon.  Other recognizable pieces are included, such as the 4 ballades, the Barcarole in F-sharp major (Op. 60), the Bolero in C major (Op. 19) and the Fantasie in F minor (Op. 49).  Sound quality is good to very good.For those obsessed with not having any duplication of downloaded works, a good portion of the tracks that are included here are also on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-99-Most-Essential-Chopin-Masterpieces/dp/B002XNI37E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The 99 Most Essential Chopin Masterpieces</a>.  Both are produced by the X5 group, and some are not just the same pieces but the exact same recordings.  A good example would be the nocturns, all of which are the same tracks that are performed by Peter Schmalfuss and included in the other set.  So if you own the other set, that may deter you from purchasing this one.But as a purchaser of the other set, I think this collection is well worth purchasing despite the duplication.  Here we have an additional ballade as well as the lion's share of etudes from Opus 10 and 25.  Here we have an additional polonaise from Opus 61.  The Sonata in G minor for cello and piano, tracks 39-42, is a new addition to this set.  The other collection includes the Sontas in B-minor and B-flat minor for piano from Opus 35 and Opus 58.While most of the same nocturnes are here, we have lost 2 from Opus 27.  The mazurcas include additions from Opus 6, Opus 50, Opus 56, and Opus 67, while we have lost movements from Opus 7, Opus 17, Opus 33, Opus 41, Opus 59, Opus 63, and Opus 68.  There is a similar mix and match of waltzes, with the subtraction of waltz number 2 from Opus 70 and the addition of waltz number 3 from Opus 64.  Preludes numbers 6, 8 and 17 have also been added from Opus 28, while number 2 has been left out.There is an argument to be made that the other collection includes better quality performances.  A good portion of the pieces that are duplicated are interpreted by different musicians and orchestras.  Concerti 1 and 2 for piano and orchestra, for example, are performed here by the Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra while the better known recording by the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra and Abbey Simon is including in the Essentials compilation.  And the waltzes are performed by Dubravka Tomsic, while the Essentials collection includes a mix of performances by Abbey Simon and Dubravka Tomsic.  Yet all the performances in this set are of a high enough caliber for any lover of classical piano music to enjoy.I only have one minor complaint as it pertains to the sound.  While I enjoyed the ballades as performed by Freddy Kempf, there seems to be a  resonance in the way they were recorded.  I don't think it detracts from the recording, but it is noteworthy.CONCLUSIONWhile perhaps 30 to 40 percent of this collection is comprised of the same pieces from the Essentials collection, the majority of those are by different performers.  And the flow has been much improved with the additional works that bridge the included ones.  While the other collection includes great performances, there are not too many things to complain about here.  This is a great collection for lovers of Chopin and classical piano. Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.011959453113377094}

{"text": "I was very sceptical when I listened to a few previews of this album, you get what you pay for and all that, but for $1.99 I didn't care if it sounded like it was being played in a garbage can by a three year old. Boy, was I ever in for an incredible surprise.First and foremost, the sound quality is great, not at all like the samples seemed to be online, even listening to them on the 400 watt system hooked up to my computer. Full range, rich, razor sharp sound that begs to be listened to at concert hall levels.The biggest discovery for me is the breathtaking artistry of Freddy Kempf! His rendition of the four Ballades is nothing short of astounding, teasing phrases out with liberal rubato, never before heard dynamics, and amazing tempo interpretations. He takes Chopin to a whole new level, thrilling with virtuouso perfection and exciting with his grandly emotive playing. It's amazing when you listen to the album from the beginning; first Kempf on the Ballades, then a bunch of others (don't get me wrong, they're good), then all of a sudden, the Fantasie Impromptu starts and it's so distinct, you \"get\" Kempf instantly.Freddy Kempf is the second great young piantist to refresh, reinvigorate and push the limits of what you thought Chopin's writing was all about (Evgeny Kissin is the other.) Simply put, Kempf is explosive, revealing Chopin at his most insane. His version of the second Ballade is a case in point. If you're a strident traditionalist, his playing may not be for you--but some of the other players on the album are far tamer so buy it anyway. For Kempf's playing alone, I cannot recommend this album highly enough. And for $1.99, how can you go wrong?\n", "val": 0.03192852810025215}

You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by the one of the greatest Romantic composers of all time.  There are the ballades, the etudes, the preludes, the nocturnes, the mazurkas among others.  These are primarily piano pieces - but oh! what piano pieces!  They are complex, lyrical, sonorous, uplifting, radiant piano pieces that are the signature of Chopin.  No one writes music likes this other than Chopin.  This is music at it's best!  Chopin was clearly a genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for relaxation, meditation,reading, or as the background for your life.

Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself. At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussey.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.

I grew up listening to my father's classical records and continue to listen to quite a bit of classical music on record. I'm used to a little bit of imperfection. As a result, I tend to focus more on performance quality and the emotional resonance of the music. In this collection, you get solid renditions of the \"best of\" Chopin. The only reason to pass up this collection is if you already own most of the music in this collection. Otherwise, even if you aren't a huge fan of Chopin, this collection is well worth the current $1.29 price tag.

{"text": "Undoubtedly Chopin is one of the most beloved piano composers in history and with his countless pieces it's hard to capture them in a single purchase especially one that's less than 2 bucks.  Well, not any longer!  To have this many Chopin pieces in a single album, including both concertos is a phenomenal value.  So what's the catch...  First catch is, although the performances are well done, they are performed by relatively unknowns(albeit talented and capable artists).  I would say they are all formidable performances. Second catch is, the recordings are not particularly high quality.  Specifically, many of the performances are a bit distant sounding and a bit muddled, IMHO not to the point where it's a problem though.  This purchase are for those that love Chopin and don't really care who's playing it as long as it's being played well.  It's also for those who love to have Chopin playing the background for hours on end.  This purchase is not for those who can't stand anyone else playing Chopin other than Argerich, Ashkenazy, or some other legendary pianist or for the audiophile who needs the mics scientifically placed to capture every nuance.\n", "val": 0.00011615877156145871}

{"text": "Here we have a terrific collection of the most popular music from Tchaikovsky, plus some that is less well known. The highlights are the symphonies and the violin concerto. The performances and recordings are generally very good to excellent.The Violin Concerto is given a tour de force interpretation by Israeli violinist Vadim Glutzman, with British conductor Andrew Litton conducting the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. This is a concerto that deserves the Tchaikovsky's erratic passionate nature to be transmitted from both the soloist and the orchestra. Here the first movement by itself leaves you exhausted from the drama that this combination is able to create. It is a delightful respite when Glutzman is able to convey the lyrical beauty of the slow movement (which also has its passionate moments). The third movement starts as it means to go on, passionate momentum and fireworks from the violinist, but also tender and beautiful playing from the winds in the orchestra. As with most of the pieces in this collection the recording is second to none, with great sharpness of detail and undistorted climaxes.Glutzman also gives us a piece that was new to me: \"Souvenir d'un lieu cher\" a poignant and playful memory of a \"place that is dear to one's heart\", once again played with the Bergen and Litton combination. This is reminiscent of Elgar's violin pieces from the same period, fairly light and romantic, played by Glutzman without schmalz but with occasional bravura.This collection includes most of Neeme Jarvi's set of the major Tchaikovsky symphonies (not the Manfred, that is played by the Moscow Radio Orchestra under Gennadi Rozhdestvensky) in his acclaimed series with the Gothenberg Symphony Orchestra&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tchaikovsky-The-Symphonies-and-Orchestral-Works/dp/B004OTY1EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tchaikovsky: The Symphonies and Orchestral Works</a>&nbsp;along with some of the  shorter orchestral works from this collection ( Cappricio Italien, Voyevoda (2 pieces) , Romeo and Juliet, Francesca de Rimini,Eugene Onegin (2), Festive Overture). The recordings are superb, as are the performances, with pin point recording of the instruments and a broad spread and acoustic.The Bamberg Symphony Orchestra under Jose Serebrier gives us the Marche Slave, The Tempest and the \"1812\". Pretty standard Tchaikovsky fare played well but unmemorably. The same orchestra, this time under Leif Sagerstam provide support to Roland Pntinen in a lively and well played performance of the famous Piano Concerto no. 1.I didn't know the Trio for Cello, Violin and Piano and enjoyed this spirited performance by the Trio Amati. Once again this is performed with great passion and virtuosity, at times a little exhaustingly. This is a surprisingly long piece for a piano trio, just over 48 minutes. At one time this would have filled an LP record and now its a kind of filler on a 14 hour compilation!The cello also takes centre stage for the \"Roccoco Variations\", played by Victor Simon with the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra under Vladimir Fedoseyev. Simon was principle cellist with the orchestra, which, I understand, is now known as the \"Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra\". The orchestra tours under this name and this recording was released under this and in Simon's honour, just before his 70th birthday in the year 2000. The Variations are nicely played with excellent support from the orchestra - it's not quite Rostrapovich/Karajan but in this context a worthy competitor.We are fortunate here to be offered the complete Nutcracker Ballet, offered elsewhere in these compilations as less than complete. (There are many overlaps in this set but their significance will depend on how many of the other (\"Essential\" etc) BIS compliations you have). The Bonn Classical Philharmonic and Heribert Beissel are the players here, a real orchestra with a real conductor. Such is the German commitment to classical music that it seems that every town or city will have its own orchestra, or two (Bonn also has its Beethoven Orchestra). Here we have a complete ballet, with all the numbers, some of which are less memorable than others. It's good to have it complete,and the playing is more than competent, even if we don't have the string perfection of the Berlin Philiharmonic.We also have the suite from Swan Lake - played by Hungarian State Orchestra and Emil Edlinger - another competent performance and recording - and a few piano pieces, including a nicely played Barcarolle from The Seasons.This is a compilation that is priced a little above the usual deal prices of 99cents, or $1.99 but I think it is worth it if you don't have too many duplicates in your collection. In my opinion the symphonies and violin concerto are worth this by themselves.\n", "val": 0.03543836995959282}

There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself. At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussey.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!  Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Grieg, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Composer Compilation\n", "val": 0.00392848951742053}
{"text": "I don't listen to a lot of Grieg.  OK, there is the piano concerto which everyone knows.  And, of course the Peer Gynt Suites, with the famous Hall of the Mountain King from the first suite being particularly famous.  Besides these, before this set I only had a handful of Grieg, such as the Lyric Suite Op 54, in my collection.  Well, for a couple of bucks and a short wait while they were imported into iTunes I now have about 8 and half hours of Grieg, not including the repeats from my existing collection.I've listen through a couple of times now, concentrating on the music that is new to me.  Although I usually listen to 20th/21st century music I do like that of the late Romantic and Grieg is no exception.  Listening to these pieces I hear some of Schumann's influence but a lot more Liszt, though with a lighter, more Mendelssohn touch. His great influence was Chopin but I don't hear a lot of it in the pieces included here.  Despite his influences most of this music is obviously from one singular hand - we still listen to Grieg instead of the numerous forgotten composers of his age because he did have a unique voice.  Grieg also had nationalistic leanings and incorporated the sound of Norway in his music.The music is well performed and recordings are all good.  Most of the pieces are complete instead of just single movements.  In other words, this doesn't sound like a cheap collection.You may not listen to this all of the time but for 2 bucks you owe it to yourself to give the music a try - you just may find your new favorite piece.\n", "val": 0.012020174413919449}
{"text": "I bought this collection mostly for song 5 - Hall of the Mountain King.  Since Grieg was a 19th century Scandinavian, this song is about a Scandinavian fantasy.  Basically the hero enters a hall of trolls and tip-toes in, giving to the soft mood of the song.  Then the trolls see him, creating suspense.  Eventually the king of the cave sees him and he runs away, creating the most frightful part of the song when the cave collapses, killing all the trolls and king.Unfortunately this collection made my iPod untidy.  I expected the ipod to show 100 songs with the creator to be Grieg, but the iPod instead sorted them by the philharmonic that played them. What a drag.\n", "val": 2.6695377528085373e-05}

Indeed, the French master, Claude Debussy used Grieg's String Quartet as a template for his own String Quartet.Apart from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto #1 and perhaps the two piano concertos by Brahms; Grieg's Piano Concerto is probably the best piano concerto of the Romantic Era.Grieg's Piano Sonata might be the greatest piano sonata of the Romantic Era bar none.All of these outstanding works can be heard in this collection of Grieg's music; and you get it for less than $3.While I'm not familiar with any of the performers; my reaction was that the playing was sincere and more than adequate.Apart from the above mentioned works, and the very popular \"Peer Gynt\"; are also Grieg's piano music and songs which are all quite lovely.To the novice, I would advise that this is not thunderous music along the lines of Beethoven or Brahms. Don't expect to hear anything big and brassy. Grieg composed a smaller scale creating lovely little flowers as opposed to powerful mountains and delicate snowflakes as opposed to raging storms.\n", "val": 0.0325874462723732}

{"text": "If you need to fill holes in your Tchaikovsky collection, or you're looking to replace that lost or broken CD.  Or, if you've never bought a Tchaikovsky CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by one of  the greatest Russian composers of all time.  There's The Nutcracker Suite of course, and then there's Swan Lake, The 1812 Overture, The Romeo and Juliet Overture, Symphonies 1-6, amongst others.  This is some of the best and well known classical music outside of some pieces by Bach, and Beethoven's 5th.  The 1812 has been in so many movies, and every xmas they play Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy, or some such.  The same is true for R&J, and Swan Lake.  You couldn't get out of the way if you tried.  Don't get me wrong, this music is timeless and gorgeous.  It doesn't get better than this!  Tchaikovsky was clearly an inspired Russian genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for relaxing, meditation, reading, or as the background for your life.  It's simply hours and hours of beautiful music!FOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong, even if some aren't perfectly executed.FOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself. At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussy.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!

{"text": "If this is still available at the Black Friday price then you should buy it, if only for the fact that it includes many excellent performances on authentic Baroque instruments.First lets get the Musici San Marco out of the way. This is a fictitious group that, on my old cheap CD (\"Vivaldi on Authentic Instruments\")were labelled as being conducted by Alberto Lizzio - rumoured to be a nom de plume of Alfred Scholz. The violinist, Josef Merten, is also likely to be fictitious. However the tracks here (as on my CD) reveal spirited and well recorded music making. Of course, these are now duplicates in my collection but I am prepared to put up with that because of the quality of the tracks generally, especially the two vocal/choral pieces: Stabat Mater\" and the \"Magnificat\" - performed by Jakub Brurzynski, a Polish counter tenor and conductor of \"La Tempesta\".I note that a movement of the Stabat Mater was included in another BIS collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-99-Darkest-Pieces-Of-Classical-Music/dp/B0048NUUS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The 99 Darkest Pieces Of Classical Music</a>. It is quite darkly done. with Brurzynski offering a darkly toned countertenor and ominous colours from the orchestra, appropriate for a piece which tells the \"Sorrows of Mary\", a mood which is continued in the short piece Sonata al Santo Sepolcro, RV 130. The \"Magnificat\" shows rather close microphone placing for the small (one voice to a part?) choir and a rather more energetic countertenor than in the Stabat Mater. I enjoyed this less than the other piece, finding Jakub Brurzynski's singing just a little too strident, even if technically sound. He is balanced, though, by some good singing from the women in the choral group. The orchestral playing is of a good standard. My final judgement on this is that it is enjoyable, if not at the highest of standards.I've discovered the excellent recorder playing of Dan Laurin on some other of these inexpesive offerings. Here he joins the Bach Collegium Japan and the Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble in some well recorded and spirited performances of well known Vivaldi flute concertos. The Drottningolm group also supports well known players Monica Huggett (violin) and Jakob Lindberg (Lute)as well as Nils-Erik Sparf on baroque violin (who also might actually lead this group). Sparf performs that old chestnut the \"Four Seasons\" in a performance that has been deservedly well reviewed elsewhere and is worth listening to, rather than skipping as \"just another four seasons\". His playing is accurate, spirited when needed and dark when appropriate.Von der Goltz is a famous name in the world of baroque music. Gottfreid has been the leader of the famous Freiberger Baroque Orchestra and it would seem that the Conrad von der Goltz Chamber Orchestra is named after (and led by?)his father. His sister, Kristin plays one of two cellos in the concerto RV531 in this compilation, joined by Ute Zimmermann in what is a delightfully and skilfully played rendition.The London Baroque are an established group that are well respected in the world of authentic interpretation. This collection contains two pieces - the \"La Folia\" variations and the Sonata no 3, Opus 2 for violin and Bass Continuo. These are well played and satisfying interpretations that are recorded well.Against this background of excellent authentic recordings there are, unfortunately some disappointments. The recordings by Camerata Rhenania and the Janacek Chamber Orchestra do not match those of the other ensembles in this compilation. The recording of the Camerata is not of the same standard as the rest of the package here. There is coarseness in the upper register which makes for a tiring listening experience, even though the performances are adequate- using baroque trumpets by the sound of it in the concerto for two trumpets. The L'Estro Armonico Op3 piece played by them is similarly recorded and a rather turgid performance. The Janacek Orchestra also provides some lacklustre performances of the other L'Estro Armonico pieces. This is a rather old-fashioned style of performance, but the recordings are better than the Rhenania group and in the end I have gone past my initial reaction and quite like them. Modern instrument recordings and performances ofetn don't stand comparison with recordings on authentic instruments and in what is often a more spritely style that befits the dance origins of much of the music.The St Petersburg Soloists provide another modern instrument performance with Vladimir Kurlin playing the Concerto for Oboe no 8 (Vivaldi wrote at least 20) - this is nicely played and stands well alongside the other recordings here.As with most of these BIS collections there will be duplicates if you have other selections on your computer or MP3 player - for instance the Dan Laurin \"Il Gardelino\". In my opinion it's worth having a few duplicates. This collection is slightly higher priced than the traditional offer prices of these BIS collections (99c or $1.99) and will no doubt increase after the Black Friday period. If you look the range of pieces and what it would cost to buy these in their orginal forms then they can still be a good buy.In conclusion this is a set that is worth a lot more than the price of a cup of coffee! The quality of the recordings and performances is in general high and a worthy addition to anyone's collection, even if they do have 10 other versions of the Four Seasons!\n", "val": 0.004294158890843391}

Less well known artists perform the works and the sound is adequate.  The major drawback for this album as it was for previous collections of composer masterpieces is that the titles of individual works begin with an all inclusive \" concerto\" with a numerical listing  -- 1,2,3,4. and not the real luj of the piece nor whether it is for mandolin, lute, etc. nor key.  The Amazon compilers of the \"Rise of the Masters\" series were obviously not knowledgeable that for classical music the composer, then the work and then the artist or key are important.  In addition, the yahoos often list the artist as the composer (by) so and so.  Consequently you can find such gaffes as:  Concerto by Guarnieri --the quartet of musicians that performs the piece -- which is really annoying.\n", "val": 5.362014417187311e-05}

{"text": "I'm looking at my collection of Vivaldi 100 Supreme Masterpieces, and noticing I have lots less than 100 pieces here. The track numbering goes like this: 1-12, 23, 35-79. That's an attrition rate of over 40%. I'm not that picky, either.Who survived my pruning? The Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble. Most of what they do is very good, and their 4 Seasons is a very nice, \"not crazy,\" rendition. You also get another piece from opus 8, number 10. These are incisively played, and the ensemble plays with very good attention to detail.Likewise, when they team up with Jakob Lindberg on the Vivaldi lute pieces, the results are as good as you will find, even if the music is a bit light weight.The group London Baroque gets a couple of chamber pieces here. They should have gotten more. The variations on La Folia are fun. They play with more vibrato than the Drottningholm Ensemble (which essentially uses none).Dan Laurin teams up with the Drottningholm Ensemble for a couple of pieces and also with the Bach Collegium of Japan. Laurin is a good recorder player, but he tends to \"noodle around,\" particularly in the slow movements.The Musicians of San Marco are a group that appears mainly in compilations. The reason? They don't stand out. They are not well recorded; they sound distant and muffled. None-the-less, the second movement of the violin concerto Il Ritiro is quite good. The rest of what they do is passable.La Tempesta is also recorded at a distance. They aren't too bad on the instrumental pieces, but the Magnificat sounds like it was recorded in an echo chamber. It doesn't help that the counter-tenor can't sing runs, and the soprano tends to go sharp.The Conrad von der Goltz Chamber Orchestra plays Vivaldi in that good old 1950s style: Recorded at a distance, and everything sustained as long as possible.The Petersburg Soloists are recorded somewhat closer, the better to hear that tremendous vibrato, and all the other 19th century add-ons.I've haven't heard of the Camerata Rhenania. Their recording of the trumpet concerto uses slow tempos, partly because the trumpeters don't sound like they could handle anything faster. The concerto, op. 3, no. 11 features slow tempos, and lots of vibrato. The recordings are distant and mushy.The renditions of Vivaldi's L'Estro Armonico by the Janacek Chamber Orchestra aren't too bad, however. Their ensemble playing is sloppy, and they know very little about Baroque performance practice, but they play with some verve, even if their Allegros are all the same, exact tempo. I didn't keep them because I already have three better versions of the complete set.Bottom line, currently the set costs $2.00. Get it and keep what you like.\n", "val": 0.004640830680727959}

His music is a little hard to pin down genre-wise -- it's more soul than anything, but with a bit of a reggae feel in many of the beats.

It's a great set for those who want to listen to the complete works as the composer intended.  This set includes some of the same works, including complete works, and is a better value.  It has about 1 hour less of music but is about half as much.This collection features many performances by the Bach Collegium Japan and Masaaki Suzuki, while in the full works collection they are only represented in the Cantata (BWV 147) and the Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D Major (BWV 1068).  Also duplicated are the 5 tracks that make up the performance by Conrad von der Goltz of Partita Number 2, while the other set does not include the 6 tracks devoted to Nobuko Imai's rendition of Partita Number 3.This set also contains a number of works present in the other set but by different performers.  Orchestral Suite Number 2 in B Minor (BWV 1067) is performed here by the Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble and Penelope Evison, while the Masters set includes a performance by Camerata Rhenania and Eugen Duvier.  Similarly the Sonata in E-Flat Major for Flute and Harpsichord (BWV 1031) is performed here by Sharon Bezaly and Terence Charlston, while in the other set it is performed by The Moravian Trio.  About a quarter of the same works are similarly presented on the other set by different performers.CONCLUSIONThis set includes a nice variety of high quality performances at a great value.  There is definitely tremendous value to those who want to listen to these works sequentially with all the movements.  While both sets provide some complete works, and the other set still has sufficient variety, the Rise of the Masters collection is a better value at this time.  I hope you get to purchase and enjoy one or both of these collections.Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.0034439084120094776}
{"text": "We're seeing more of these classical music collections on Amazon, and this one is superb. Nearly half of the tracks are from the outstanding Bach Collegium Japan (BCJ), or its conductor, complemented by an assortment of other skilled performers. Here's what we have in this album.Tracks 1-3 Brandenburg Concerto No. 3, BCJ -- Performed at an astonishingly breakneck pace (especially the third movement), the strings are skillful and lyrical. At this very upbeat tempo, the third movement becomes an unfolding of changing textures, in the spirit of Philip Glass, which is an interesting change from other slower performances. Like all the BCJ tracks here, the recording is superb.4 Toccata and Fugue in D Minor -- A polished and enjoyable performance, like many other recordings of this work. For a very different interpretation that I like better, filled with energy, check out Bach Organ Blaster, with Michael Murray as the organist.5-7 Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, again with the BCJ. -- Very nice, and well-recorded. The harpsichord solo in the first movement is not my favorite interpretation, but it's fine and precise in every way.8 Prelude in C Minor for Solo Lute -- Mellow, nicely recorded.9-13 Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D Major, BCJ -- Another fine performance from the BCJ, and wonderfully recorded. A gem.14-20 Orchestral Suite No. 2 in B Minor, Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble -- Very good sound, and a solid performance in the European style. Includes the famous Bourree which does not disappoint.21-26 Partita No. 3 in E Major -- This virtuoso work for solo violin is performed by the very accomplished Nobuko Imai. Solid. The Rondo in the third movement is one of my favorite Bach pieces.27-31 Partita No. 2 in D Minor -- Another virtuoso work for solo violin. Recorded in a larger hall than the previous Partita, so it has a different sound. Conrad von der Goltz is also very good. I think I like Nobuko Imai's performance of the No. 3 a bit better.32 Sheep May Safely Graze, from Cantata BWV 208 -- This is performed by a brass band, which is a very different sound than the usual baroque orchestra. It's a very nice mellow sound.33-42 Cantata BWV 147, BCJ -- Includes the famous chorale Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring. A beautiful performance of the full cantata, very nicely recorded, with excellent soloists.43 Fugue in G Minor for Solu Lute -- Very nice performance of music that Bach also used in different settings.44-49 Six Schubler Chorales -- Performed by Hans Fagius, organist. The sound is very spacious and pleasing. Fagius uses good voicing on the organ.50 Aria and 30 Variations from the Goldberg Variations -- Very nice harpsichord, and very well recorded.51-53 Sonata in E-Flat Major for Flute and Harpsichord -- Very pleasing performance and recording, but to my ear not distinguished in any particular way.54 Adagio in B Minor from the Easter Oratorio, BCJ -- The Easter Oratorio is one of my favorite Bach works. The Adagio is slow and plaintive. Nicely recorded as are all the BCJ tracks.55-60 Suite No. 1 in G Major -- This is a virtuoso work for solo cello. Torleif Thedeen's tone and technique are great. And it's recorded very nicely. You'll often hear more than one string on the cello played together. This is a difficult technique to master, and integral to this work (and also to the earlier Partitas for violin). Solid.61-66 Concerto No. 2 in E Major, BCJ -- Another wonderful performance from the BCJ. Just beautiful in every way.67 Fugue in G Minor -- This is the famous Little Fugue for organ. This is performed on a small organ (or at least with small voicing), which suits the piece well. The tempo is very moderate. I'm accustomed to hearing this played at a somewhat more upbeat tempo. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable recording.68-73 Suite in E Minor for Solo Lute -- Again by Jakob Lindberg, this is a polished performance. The solo lute is mellow and relaxing. Try this one as background music over a romantic dinner.74-76 Double Concerto in D Minor, BCJ -- Yet another very fine recording from the BCJ.77-79 Double Concerto in C Minor, BCJ -- Also from the BCJ, and excellent in every way. The solo oboe is beautiful and lyrical.80 Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor -- An organ work performed by Otto Winter. Fine in every way, but also check out the very energetic recording of this on Bach Organ Blaster by Michael Murray.81-85 Inventions for Harpsichord -- Performed by Masaaki Suzuki, founder and conductor of the BCJ. Excellent performances, and very nicely recorded.86-88 Concerto in A Major -- Solid performance in old-school European style.89-91 Concerto in G Minor -- Another performance in the European style. The tempo should be a bit faster, in my humble opinion. But a nice recording, very enjoyable.92 Suite No. 3 in C Major -- This virtuoso work for solo cello is performed very nicely by Torleif Thedeen. Romantic and lyrical.93-100 Mass in B Minor (highlights), BCJ -- The B-minor mass is one of Bach's best large works. The perfomance is solid, the recording impeccable. Excellent chorus and soloists.In summary, this is an excellent collection, and an impressive value. Most of the performances are superb, and there aren't any real losers here at all.

{"text": "The \"Rise of the Masters\" series is phenomenal not only because the price is low, but the performances are top-notch. What you get are selections from BIS label artists, and they are not slouches. On this recording, you have solo, choral, and orchestral pieces from the Bach Collegium Japan, led by Maasaki Suzuki, and he knows his stuff. The lute and cello suites are masterfully done as well. Hans Fagius gives a few of Bach's most popular organ works, and does justice to the voicing, as other reviewers have noted. You also cannot quibble with the selection; Bach produced a lot of fantastic music, but these are selections of his most popular across all genres, so you're not missing out. In fact, a great place to start with Bach. Not many of us have lots of money to spend chasing great performances by marquee artists, but what's wonderful about this set is that with performances of this quality, there's no urgency to acquire Hilary Hahn playing the same violin concertos. Bravo to BIS!\n", "val": 0.019231298938393593}

{"text": "Maestro Bach! I'll probably right, if I note that his music laid the foundation for the classics. Brilliant Bach was a pioneer of musical styles. He was considerably ahead of its time. But contemporaries did not appreciate his talent, since it is known that the great composer's life dragged out a miserable existence. His fate was heavy and largely unhappy. But his work is permeated with the light of love and many centuries later, his music inspires the desire to live and to admire his genius. This album beautifully conveys the genius of the composer. Thank you very much!\n", "val": 0.01849828101694584}

The diversity of music is really nice, and it made me discover the work for lute which I was totally unaware of.A fair half of the recordings are good (including the Brandebourgeois concertos [note: I generally don't like these concertos, so the fact that I liked these versions indicates they are really good], the Mass BWV281, the works for lute (new and refreshing) and harpsichord), but the other half seems a little bit old and outdated (especially the violin concertos) and you may find better versions elsewhere. However, the price is ridiculously low, and would still be very low even if you kept only the best half of the box, so overall it is an excellent quality/price ratio.\n", "val": 0.004850856959819794}

The story of Bach's life is fascinating.  He was the court composer, under orders to quickly churn out masterpieces one after the next for the pleasure of the Royal Family and it's court.  And did he ever!I adore pipe organs and harpsichords and it's the songs on this wonderful collection with those instruments I particularly get off on.  But there isn't one masterpiece here that is any less than the rest.  The music soars, creates magnificent fantasies and tapestries in my mind, and tells the story of how one man's brilliant musical brain was chock full of the most amazingly rich fabrics of composition of anyone who ever lived.This starts off with the beloved Brandenburg Concerto.  There are a multitude of masterpieces, but the one I love best is one I had not heard before called Fantasia, on the pipe organ.  What an incredible, brilliant experience to listen to this on great speakers at a good volume, to emulate the true pipe organ experience of feeling the sound vibrations of the lower notes.I listened to this while eating some Belgian chocolates, drinking fine champagne, and looking at some coffee table books of Van Gogh, Matisse and other artists, with a huge vase of oriental lilies on the table in front of me.  It was perfect;  a classical sensual overload.  Some may not understand, but others will know what I'm talking about.

Or, if you've never bought a Bach CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by the greatest Baroque  composer of all time.  All the known standards are here.  The Toccata and Fugue in D minor, Jesu, Joy of Mans Desiring, Sheep May Safely Graze, Minuet in G, The Brandenburg Concertos, the Inventions,  The Mass in B minor (which includes dona nobis pacem), amongst other things.  There is so much beautiful music on this MP3 download it absolutely boggles my mind.  This is music that most people have heard before, but may not have known it.  Between movies and tv, it's amazing what you're exposed to without knowing it.  This is music at it's best!  You get piano, orchestra, orchestra plus choir, everything on this download is worth more the price of admission.  Bach was clearly a monumental genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for relaxing, meditation, or as the background for your life.  It's simply hours and hours of beautiful!FOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong.FOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself. At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussy. You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!

I was seeking some songs from my childhood, as my dad was a big fan of classical and opera, and this album did not disappoint! Also found some new (to me, anyway) material that I've never heard. (Please pardon my lack of expertise or \"classical music vocabulary\"- I'll try to get across what I mean as well as I can, even though I don't know all that much about classical music. I just know what I like, not the terminology.) This album is full of BIG music- kind of more \"hardcore\" classic, more powerful stuff. It's very moving, very kinetic music, with more energy than I'd have thought this style of music would have- it's kind of emotional, not flat and dry. My usual types of music tend more towards alternative, classic rock, and older pop, so this album and the other that I mentioned above are a little off of my usual path, but I'm really enjoying it. I would heartily recommend this album to anyone who wants to dabble in a different genre than their usual- it's a lot of material, hours and hours of it, but it's not boring, and makes for great background sound for cooking and cleaning up around the house. It's a vacation from the usual noise, and priced very, very well. Give it a shot- you won't be disappointed, and it'll give you an idea of how other forms of music evolved, too.

I noticed that Amazon does not show the composer for these, but the composers are tagged in these MP3s, so if your software supports it (mine does) it will show you who the composer of each piece is, so if you like something, you know who to look up.My one small con is that, \"The Planets\" is prominently listed in the title, but there are only two movements in this compilation and Holst's \"The Planets\" contains 7 movements (Earth didn't count and Pluto had not yet been discovered, although Pluto IS STILL a planet :)).

{"text": "Robert Randolph burst onto the music scene more than a decade ago with The Word, an instrumental gospel-blues project put together by fusion jam band stalwart John Medeski of Medeski, Martin & Wood, and the North Mississippi Allstars as a vehicle for Randolph to show the kind of \"sacred steel\" music that had been played for years in a few churches that relied on steel guitars rather than organs.  The album was jaw-dropping, and Randolph was the undisputed star.  For his first proper solo album, he went the live route with Live at the Wetlands.  The album showed him incorporating more funk and rock into his sound, which had dazzling highlights based around his incomparable pedal steel chops.  However, that album was not flawless.  Randolph comes from a musical tradition based more around riffs than melodic exploration, so when put into a conventional jam band mold of long improvisational passages, he tended to repeat his riffs a bit too much for some people's tastes.  That was the standard criticism of him at the time, and he took it to heart, although perhaps too much.  He released a series of studio albums that went more for concise songs accented by Randolph's bursts of fiery playing, and continued his exploration of funk and rock.  However, those albums left me wanting more of his instrumental work.  Like Goldilocks, Randolph was searching for a balance that was just right.  Here, he seems to have found it.  As a comparison, the longest tracks on this album are shorter than the shortest track on Live at the Wetlands, and far shorter than most of those tracks.  I'm an Allman Brothers fanatic, so when I see a jam band album, my default preference is for longer tracks since I like elaborate melodic explorations, but for Randolph, slightly shorter tracks aren't a bad thing.  It just means that repetition is kept to a minimum.  When Randolph solos here, every note counts, and the band plays with real power, surrounded by occasional guests like Susan Tedeschi, whose gospel-inflected blues voice is perfect for Randolph's style.  Besides, she is apparently used to singing along-side slide guitar virtuosos (if you didn't know, her husband is Derek Trucks, with whom she released a fantastic album last year).  Live In Concert is the album on which Randolph's sound really gels.  The music is now a completely distinctive hybrid of blues, funk, rock and gospel that has obvious roots in sacred steel, but sounds like no other sacred steel player (even aside from the fact that no other player has Randolph's chops).  Randolph's solos have more punch to them because he doesn't just repeat riffs in order to stretch out the length of the songs to satisfy jam band cliches.  Randolph is now clearly \"going in the right direction,\" to borrow a title from one of his earlier songs.\n", "val": 0.00576104037463665}

{"text": "There is no question that when it has came down to Coldplay over the last decade, they have been the most distinctive group when it has came down to melodic music. But they haven't yet done a collaboration with their music for their fans with other singers. They have decided to give it a shot with Rihanna on Princess Of China, the third single from their latest album Mylo Xyloto. The song is very melodic from the music alone, yet it doesn't even come that way in tems of the chemistry Rihanna has with Chris Martin & company. Sadly, she has absolutely no connection with the song that has made Coldplay so distinctive this past decade. In fact, she kind of makes the song very wimpy, and lacking chemistry. I think it would've been better off from Chris's voice alone, or if they has teamed up with someone whom had a better voice. This is Coldplay's first time teaming up with someone else. While I do love Coldplay, this wasn't as strong as Paradise and Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall brought out.

Indeed, if you have a collection of over 600 Christmas tunes or so then - like adding spice to a soup - mixing-in such a collection of architecturally-echoing narcissism might indeed randomly spice up that \"broth\" a bit --- add some old-world charm --- anything else would encourage narcolepsy.So while one gets over 40 chants for a mere .89, until I caught the spirit of this album (yes, it is there) l felt like demanding my money back.

{"text": "This review is more to explain what's occurring on this album. I saw some reviews saying that this is not Christmas music and well, some of it is and most of it is Advent music.First a short history lesson. These chants all relate to the old mass (and also the pre-Vatican II Divine Office), what is now known as the Extraordinary Form (EF) Mass (or the Tridentine Mass) after Pope Benedict XVI's Summorum Pontificum. The Mass grew from the early Church, was codified by Pope St. Pius V at the Council of Trent (16C) and existed (and continues to do so) until the Novus Ordo Mass (the one that the vast majority of Catholics only know) came into being in 1969. If you're a Catholic who is lucky enough to have an EF Mass offered nearby (approved by Ecclesia Dei of course) then these would be the chants or prayers you would hear during the Advent Masses.A few notes on the parts of the EF Mass (some of which still exist in the Ordinary Form). Intriotus (or Introit in English) is the opening prayer of the Mass. It occurs after the procession and the prayers at the foot of the altar. Graduale (or Gradual) is the prayer between the Epistle and Alleluia. The Hallelujah (or Alleluia) is prayed between the Gradual and the Gospel. Offertorium (offertory) is prayed during (choir) or before (priest) the priest makes the offerings of the gifts. Communio (Communion) is rayed during (choir) or after (priest) Communion.For each track:#1 - Conditor alme siderum comes from Vespers (Evening prayer of of the Divine Office). It's a hymn for the Advent season. It would be prayed every evening during Advent (until Christmas Eve) by all priests and religious as well as any laity who take part in the Divine Office#2 - is the Introit for the first Sunday in Advent#3-8 are for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Alma Redemptoris Mater is the Marian Antiphon for the Advent and Christmas Season (ending at the Feast of the Purification-Feb 2)#9-11 are for the 2nd Sunday in Advent.12-18 are for the 3rd Sunday in Advent. Although note that Kyrie (Lord Have Mercy prayer), Sanctus (Holy Holy Holy Lord prayer) and Agnus Dei (Lamb of God prayer) would be for every Mass. The setting of these Chant can differ by season or feast. This is Mass setting XVII which is for Advent & Lent.#19 for the 4th Sunday of Advent#20-26 are called the O Antiphons. Each of these start with \"O\" and are a name for Christ mentioned in Scripture (Wisdom, Lord, Root of Jesse, Key of David, Dayspring, King of the nations, With Us is God) and are chanted before and after the Magnificat as part of Vespers in successive days from December 17 to December 23.#27 - The Magnficat (or the Canticle of Mary) which comes from Luke 1:46-55 and is prayed every evening as part of Vespers.#28 - A Solis Ortus Cardine is a hymn sung as part of Lauds (Divine Office-morning prayer) on Christmas day.#29 - The Introit of Christmas Eve#30-32 - Christmas Day introits. There are three types of Masses for Christmas: night, dawn (or morning), day. Dominus Dixit As Me is for night, Lux Fulgebit for dawn, and Puer Natus Est Nobis for day.#33,34,38,39 - Mass VIII (de Angelis) versions of the Kyrie, Gloria (Glory to God in the Highest), Sanctus, and Agnus Dei35,36,37,40 - all from the Christmas day MassTo make things shorter, the rest relate to the actual Christmas season from Christmas Day until the Epiphany (January 6th)Hope this is helpful for everyone.\n", "val": 4.489690036280081e-05}

{"text": "Gregorian chant is its own medieval style (think roughly 800  to 1200 A.D.), so don't expect any organ swelling or jingle bells tinkling.  Until you become familiar with it, you probably won't know one piece from another.  That's doubly true if you don't know Latin.  The slightly hypnotic effect of the chant does not sound \"Christmassy\" to modern ears--nor should it, since pretty much the same style of chant was used year round.  But that's okay--you can still fully enjoy the calming effect of music designed purposely to refocus the listener's attention on the eternal and sublime.The chief seasonal difference is in the lyrics, which are prayers, Masses, and scriptures proper to the Christmas season.  I was delighted to hear again several selections we sang in choir when I was a girl.  Catholics who have ached with longing for the rich musical heritage so seldom heard nowadays will appreciate this album.The performance is spot-on, with excellent intonation and pace, and voices nicely blended.

{"text": "Chant is kind of hard to mess up.  If the singers are skilled and the recording equipment is good and the producer knows how to get the right reverb (or records it in a church with natural reverb) it's going to be fine.  This album is nicely done.The Christmassiness of this is not particularly relevant to me, although i could see where it might possibly be to someone who was a real scholar of chant.  I listen to chant often, throughout the year, and many of the chants on this album i already know from other albums i have, therefore they have long since lost any connection they might have had with the Advent and Christmas seasons.  I like to listen at bedtime or just when i am in a contemplative mood, and i don't pay much attention to what the occasion of the chant is or what the words are.  So for me, the fact that this chant is the Introit from the first Sunday of Advent and that chant is the offertory from the Sunday after Epiphany doesn't enter my mind at all.For those who love choral chant, be aware that some of the tracks do involve soloists, but i think they do a decent job, i did not find the solos to be distracting.I don't like including things like price in my rating of the music but have to say the price is great; this is a huge amount of great music--equivalent to three or four CD-fuls--for next to nothing.\n", "val": 0.0012709153816103935}

I have many recordings of classical music, opera and jazz, but since I discovered Dave a while back, I've listened to his music more than all other genres and artists combined.

The CD's instrumentals, the back up lady's voice are nothing less than outstanding.  Dave's work is so refreshing to listen to because all you get on the radio today are the big name C/W sounds that mostly sound canned, over-produced, whiny and nearly the same with real hokey, sappy  lyrics.Dave is not only a great singer, he's a great songwriter whose lyrics always tell an unforgettable story and go right to the heart...some joyful, some nostalgic, some sad.

{"text": "Superb long-form piece that goes through a number of progressions (duh) whilst maintaining upbeat and positive sounding throughout - a real high energy tonic! Jon Anderson is on a roll with this music and is clearly enjoying it. He has some great musicians alongside him, though the band sound does miss the trademark YES inflections that would propel it to even greater heights.To this listener OPEN has provided a real mood changer and renewed hope on the subject of YES MUSIC, coming a few months after the truly dire FLY FROM HERE album from his ex-bandmates that came out this Summer. Its great to hear Jon Anderson having fun and NOT sounding like he's just simply in it for the money.If there are are any minor negatives I would have to say that Jon Anderson's vocals are, in parts, incredibly nasal. I'm not sure that this is due to his relatively-recent respiratory illnesses but it can obscure some of the beauty of the multi-layered melodies. The final effect on the track almost sounds like a giant 'blowing of the nose', to prepare for the next opus....hopefully coming soon!Run on, Jon!\n", "val": 0.01967262290418148}

There are plenty of inspired musical ideas, but Jon's somewhat damaged vocals come across as under-rehearsed and are pretty sloppy.

Too bad Squire and Howe refuse to work with him; with enough work this could have been a great Yes piece. As is, it's an elaborate though quite rough sketch of what might have been.\n", "val": 3.455992919043638e-05}

Jon is in great form here, as his health issues are clearly a thing of the past. His voice is strong and clear and it is good to see him being so creative now. I can't get my mind around his being gone from Yes, as he is the missing ingredient. This song would have made a great side one of a great new Yes album.After his wonderful, \"Survival and other Stories\", album, this is a welcome addition that, to me, at least, reassures us all that the man is still here and will be for some time to come.As for the disparity of the pricing between iTunes and Amazon, only they know why. Not that either 3.99 or 7.99 is pricey, it's the big difference between the two.But as for the song itself, it is worth every dollar! Kudos to you, Jon Anderson.\n", "val": 0.0462958961725235}

{"text": "As far back as I remember, my daughter has been a huge fan of Audrey Hepburn. The movie, \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\", was her all time favorite. Little did I know that the song, \"Moon River\" was the song she had always dreamed of playing as she walked down the aisle at her wedding. This past February, my \"little girl\" got married, but that's not all of the story.See, not only am I her father, I am also a pastor. Not only did I have the great privilege of walking my baby girl down the aisle but I was also given the privilege of presiding over the wedding ceremony.As the song \"Moon River\" began to play, I looked at her and she at me, smiles on both our faces as well as tears beginning to flow from both our eyes, I could still see that same \"little girl\" who was now a grown woman who had made her daddy so proud for so many years. We began that long walk down the aisle with the eyes of many watching us, most filled with tears, just like us. When we finally reached the altar and my close friend and fellow pastor asked the question, \"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?\", I once again looked at her, now seeing the beautiful woman she has become, and uttered the words, \"I do.\" Then, taking my place in the pulpit, I saw her and my now son-in-law looking at one another with a love so intent.I have listened to this song so many times since that day and hear it afresh each time, praying that not only did this little song fulfill my \"little girl's dream\" but that all of her dreams with her husband and my grandchildren will always be fulfilled. Thank you Ms. Hepburn, for recording a song that made a dream come true.\n", "val": 0.022351671010255814}

The weeds on either side of the path are brown and the trees are dropping their leaves gently upon the ground.The last track, \"Night Mist\", is the sort of song that would accompany an evening that one would spend on a cold autumn night with family gathered around the fire.I would recommend this 100% every day for people who love Celtic Music.\n", "val": 0.021843453869223595}

For sinking into your daydreams, or safely into nightdreams, giving you a generous meditational session, or just as long-playing mood background for contemplative, creative work; for any of those things, this album is just about a \"must-have\".

Each song is a twenty-minute escape into tranquility. I especially fell in love with \"Night Mist\", myself, but bought the album because the other two pieces, once discovered, are treasures also.

Yes, I know it most likely as is the case with many other bands that fall under this category, due to a range of factors, but the one thing I think that more bands today in comparison to let's say 50 years ago had is a leg up on marketing. I don't know if any of you have noticed or not, but we live in a generation where texting mom upstairs what's for dinner is not only common but a widely accepted way of communicating. As such, with the OVERWHELMING resources (i.e. mostly the internet) that the world has to offer these bands now a days is a much more forgiving and friendly avenue for spreading the word about one's talent. I haven't used MySpace in about 5 years now but I'm almost certain that the trend of it being used predominantly as a free medium for band profiling/showcasing is still what it's predominant use is today. Bands can have a URL but it directs straight to their MySpace page because in reality, it's free and why have essentially two web pages that convey essentially the same information? I tend to go off on tangents when I'm emotionally uneasy of something and as I mentioned, bands like this that are either discredited or overlooked due to poor marketing just breaks my heart.

I noticed he's also on Verity Records now, and although it maybe a great move for him financially, the project seemed tampered with. Like as if there were too many hands on the project. On the first half, its like I could picture \"other\" gospel artist singing certain songs. Then by the 8th song \"Nothing Without You\" it shifts back to Jason's own unique style & sound. Anyway its a solid CD I like it, however, his first project spoke to me more, and maybe this one needs to grow on me.\n", "val": 0.00014974342775531113}

{"text": "Jason's voice shines on \"Shifting the Atmosphere,\" which is honestly the best song on the entire CD. He should have selected songs that showcase his smooth vocals, such as that selection.  He has little need for background vocalists or vocalists who echo what he sings; that's for vocalists who really can't sing, IMO. Jason is much too talented and his voice alone is so powerful.  I must admit, I was disappointed overall, because I heard background singers doing the majority of the singing on many of the songs. The songs that feature him as a soloist (and the duet) are what I enjoyed the most. He should do more worship \"ballads\" and write songs that compliment his beautiful voice; songs that bring the listener directly into the presence of  the Lord.  I trust he'll do better on his next project.\n", "val": 0.00968122761696577}

That's Exactly is a good crossover song.  I really like the Beatles-like guitar riff on In Your Arms.  Hard to get out of your head.  There is a Way reminds us all of the love that Christ has for each of us - the Truth and the Life and the Way.  All around one of my favorite albums.\n", "val": 0.02836764045059681}

{"text": "What an awesome album!  I saw NWS at a small concert and the Holy Spirit was STRONG.  The music on this album just makes you want to rejoice and praise Him.  Every song has a small message and it's a little different than the typical music on the radio.  You Set The Rhythm tells how God can just set the whole pace of your life if you let Him.  God take care of your needs and make you feel safe and secure like In Your Arms.  No matter your situation or the obstacles in your life, There Is A Way to the Lord.  Do Your Believe In Love speaks of just how powerful God's love is.  Both Rocky Road and Weary get right down to the heart of some old time Gospel.  And the song Jamaican Praise Medley is just a plain, outright fun praise to Jesus and the Holy Ghost!When you're done with this one, or see them live, you can't help but feel moved.

{"text": "I own everything Jaci has recorded and love just about everything she's done. Although this project is well produced and recorded, it leaves me feeling that she was trying to fit into the current \"style slot\" for contemporary Christian music instead of being distinctly Jaci as her work has been in the past. Many of the songs lack that \"something\" to make them stand out and sound different from all the rest getting airplay - a trait that has traditionally distinguished Jaci from the pack. Most of the songs on this CD did not make it to the Jaci playlist on my digital music server in the house or onto the hard drive in the truck.

{"text": "(This is Gaila's son, Jake)  I've been a fan since I was 3 ,and this CD is no dissapointment!!! Diamond is amazing!!!  You regret it if you buyt his album!!!  Just listening to the samples of this album made me fall in love with!  I love it!  The songs are magical!  Jaci pours her heart out on this record!!!  It's Jaci at her best.  If you weren't a huge fan of Love Out Loud, don't worry!!!  DIAMOND is way better!!!  The songs have great messages and great tunes.  BUY IT!!!!!  5 STARS!!!!SONG REVIEW...DIAMOND - GREAT OPENING!!!  It's perhaps the most beautiful  magical song with it's music and graceful lyrics!  It talks about how God can take anything one who is broken and sinful and turn there life around and make it shine like a diamond!  Jesus molds our lives; we need to let him take control!  He'll let us shine for him, just trust what He is doing.  (2nd favorite)GIVE THEM JESUS - This is my favorite song on the record!!!  It's very fun and catchy.  It's the lead single and a great one!  This song is one I would choose for a theme song for a mission trip.  It calls us as Christians to be witnesses and help people, but the greatest thing we can give is tell them about Jesus!!!  The song also has great vocal from Jaci!!!  Every kind of of voice Jaci sings!The Sound of Your Voice - This song is so picturesque!  God is the creater of everthing and His  creation is shouting out to Him !  We need to listen to the sound of His voice.  God's kingdom is going on right now!!  He invites the broken from all nations to hear His voice!  He is the one constant through all of time! (4th favorite)Stay - Very jazzy feel!  It's fun with a beaty sweet melody!  The song is about her youngest son.  So sentimental!!!  (7th favorite)Fall For You - Mastered song!  So precious with a pricelss message!  We can never loose Jesus when we receive Him!  We never have to walk the road alone taking on all the hardships and falls.  Jesus paid the price for us and took the fall for us!  (5th favorite)Con El Viento a mi Favor - Great spanish song!!!  The song is very powerful and majestic!  (11 favorite)Tell Me Again - We do need to be reminded that there is someone watching over us and loving us no matter what!  Jesus loves us and He loves to show us His love, so Jesus, please tell me again because this world  can put awful doubt in our heads.  (6th favorite)Girl - May be the most fun on the CD!  Very funky but flavorable tune!!!  To all the girls and even boys that think they don't measure up, don't listen to the world.  You are living to please God, not man.  (10th favorite)Trust in You - This song keeps reminding me the only thing I need and can do is put my trust in Jesus!  I don't need to see what's ahead because then I won't lean on Him.  There will be times of change, but God is there for us and will help us if we trust!  Reach out to Him!  Magical and fun!!!  (8th favorite)Guilt - This song touches me deeply.  Many people struggle to hide their pain and be something they're not.  We live a lie when we do that, but the blood that Jesus shed on the cross sheds of our guilt!  AMEN!!!  His love has saved us and He takes controls and convicts us and makes us pure.  We have to get out of ourselves to find our way to Him.  Because of His perfect love and truth we don't have to ve guilty anymore!  I love the mysterious, but intriging feeling of the music.  (3rd favorite)Good Morning SUnshine - Great ending!  It's beautiful and sweet.  It's about her oldest son.  She expresses her love for him in this song.  Sounds like a orchestra playing a lullaby!  (9th favorite)PLEASE GET DIAMOND!!!  You will be blessed!\n", "val": 0.03172022104263306}
{"text": "Prime Cuts:  Good Morning Sunshine, The Sound of Your Voice, Fall for YouThough it's not quite Velasquez's diamond anniversary, she sure has been along for a long time. Since her debut in 1992, she has been indispensable to Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) with staples such as \"On My Knee,' \"Adore\" and \"God So Loved.\"  Four years since her last disc \"Love Out Loud,\"  \"Diamond\" is Velasquez first album for InPop Records.  Like her predecessor, this new collection follows her tried and true path of pop anthems and lushful ballads. Such consistency is the fruit of her song writing team which includes CCM's most notable scribe Tony Wood plus Chad Gates, Barry Weeks and Velasquez herself.  But on several occasions, Velasquez does the detour for some jazzy excursions, a back to her roots Spanish song and even a techno-dance praise workout. Most commendable though is that this seven-time Dove Award Winner never eschews from grand truths of Scripture in her songs vis--vis the worship anthems as well as songs that addresses how we function as children of the Almighty God.Calling to mind Isaiah 61:1 where God can bring \"beauty from ashes,\" the title cut \"Diamond\" is a sanctification piece about how God can intervene in our lives to mould us to greater holiness.  While the lead single \"Give Them Jesus\" is a radio made pop song that encourages Christians to carry out the great Commission with a catchy tune and Velasquez's daring vocals.  Velasquez does not just speak of God in the third person on the techno dance flavor \"Trust in You\" she expresses her faith in Jesus despite the hardscrabble of life's trials. Despite having an easy going Jazz-lite Jason Mraz carefree feel, \"Stay\" goes for the malleable territory of the heart where Velasquez steps into the shoes of a mother bidding farewell to children.  Such rawness of emotions is palatable.Nevertheless, the highlight here is album closer \"Good Morning Sunshine:\" listen especially to how the song bespeaks of hope in God within the sonic soundscape of beautifully arranged strings lushes.  This is indeed a faith instilling song.  While the beautiful Darlene Zschech-like worship ballad \"The Sound of Your Voice\" slowly starts off slow before climaxing in a powerful chorus of longing to hear from God.  Lyrically, \"Fall for You\" has one of those ambivalent lyrics that could apply both in a romantic setting or also in reference to God.  Nevertheless, it can work as a devotional prayer to God that opens again our hearts in love for Him.  Not forgetting her roots and her legions of Spanish speaking fans, she throws a little bone with the easy going ballad \"Con El Neuto A MI Favor\" which roughly translates means \"Wind in My Favor.\"However, there are a few cuts that tries too hard to be relevant. \"Girls\" is Velasquez's advice to teenagers not to compromise who they are.  But despite having a relevant message, but it's the kind of songs many CCM artists such as Rachel Chan, V. Rose, Rachal Lampa have done.  \"Guilt,\" as the title suggests, deals with forgiveness over a pretty pedantic melody pop line.  Nevertheless, `Diamond\" is a refined beauty with many glistering facets that lead us to worship, contemplate, pray and draw us closer to holiness.  Just as the diamond is precious, the content of this disc is indispensable.\n", "val": 0.012361288070678711}

Reith is almost a mix of Eminem, tobymac, and some other funky music I can't think of, but really like.  He also just seems to have a lot of fun in his songs which is really refreshing.

Different from previous albums in that the production feels a little scaled back (not scaled back bad, but just scaled back).The musicianship and arranging are great.The lyrics on these tracks are great. A great mixture of songs about love lost and about the love of God. B does an excellent job putting words to the plight that some face and an even better job speaking about the amazing love of God. Very encouraging.Great rhymes. Great singing.Excellent features.Lecrae is solid. Lisa Gungor kinda sounds like what you expect b. reith's sangin sister to sound like if he had a sister....and PJ MORTON!! I'm a big PJ morton fan. I love how he brought his production style to for once in my life.My favorite tracks are \"for once in my life\", \"i'll get by\" and \"made for more\".This album is worth your money. If you're unfamiliar with b. reith, give him a chance and you will be pleasantly surprised. If you're still concerned about spending money, I'm pretty sure that he has a free EP (the forecast) for download floating around on the internet. Get that and then try not to part with your $9 for this album :o)\n", "val": 0.03643258661031723}

{"text": "Pete Holmes has quickly become one of my favorite working comedians with his Comedy Central half hour, this album and his podcast You Made it Weird. The title \"Impregnated with Wonder\" is a line from one of his jokes, but it also very aptly describes Pete's entire comedic disposition. He has an infectious joy about his performance. He is like a giant puppy doing stand-up comedy, and I mean that in the best way possible. He has the general life enthusiasm of Chris Hardwick and the general silliness of Paul F. Tompkins (especially the silliness of Tompkins riffing). I'm also a huge fan of comics that are more prone to going to dark places like Louis CK, Bill Burr or Marc Maron, but I find myself going back to Impregnated with Wonder more often than the albums of those other artists because not only is it hilarious, it's just FUN to listen to. If a Doug Stanhope album is the Requiem for a Dream of comedy, where you watch it once and it's really great but you don't want to watch it again for a while, Impregnated with Wonder is like the 40-Year-Old Virgin of stand-up albums. It's just as much fun the 5th time as the first.You'll probably like this album if you like:Mike BirbigliaJim GaffiganPaul F. TompkinsChris HardwickOther similar recommendations:T.J.

Many bits had me laughing so hard my sides hurt. The one about being a kid being terrible was hilarious and I identified with that one quite a bit. My only complaint was it seemed a bit short but that is probably on me to be honest. The run time is about a hour and it's likely that I was just enjoying it so much the time seemed to fly.

The way he plays with words and premises can be similar to Patton Oswalt and his silliness does remind me of Paul F. Tompkins, but he simultaneously radiates/hurls/projects jokes at the audience. His energy is infectious and his outlook on life (from what I can see from his jokes) are that of an optimist. He seems to being playing throughout his act, enjoying himself as much as the audience, if not more. His material takes the funny positive outlook on media/internet culture, emotions, and annoying human interactions. He isn't quite my cup of tea, but I enjoy his happy-go-lucky style, word play, and his genuine comedic outlook. Also, I dinged this CD because there was an obvious visual jokes that are lost to audio owners.\n", "val": 0.00807089451700449}

{"text": "After listening to my favorite comedians over and over -- (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Louis-C-K/dp/B001L5VSOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Louis C.K.</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Paul-F-Tompkins/dp/B002XI062Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Paul F.

Lately, I've been culling new comedy names from Doug Benson's podcast, Doug Loves Movies. Pete Holmes is a regular guest on that show, and he's always a lot of fun to listen to. Likewise here.The cover of this album aptly summarizes his style. He has a wide-eyed exuberance that's truly infectious, and even though it is delivered with a flair I can only describe as childish (meaning that as a compliment), his jokes are tightly written in a fun-house cerebral style that is reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Patton-Oswalt/dp/B002LCCTU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Patton Oswalt</a>&nbsp;at his best. Most of Holmes' comedy is self-deprecating, but it isn't with the angry or glum perspective you might get in other comedians. Instead, there's an \"aww shucks\" hue to it that makes it even funnier.I only have two complaints about the album. One is that several jokes involve a visual element. Pete's audience for this album was absolutely stellar (he does a fantastic job incorporating them into his bits), but their favorite joke by far involved no punchline, but Pete standing in a particular way. Obviously there is no way for listeners of the album to know what the stance was; it's more than a little bit of a tease for the listener to hear what is ostensibly the funniest bit when said bit needs to be seen rather than heard. One would think that, when recording a set for an album, that a comedian would avoid material like this.The only other complaint is a small one, and it might be specific to me. I have a few pet peeves about comedians (you can't listen to as many comedy albums as I do without consistently loving and hating certain quirks), but the biggest one is this: I am always turned off by comedians that laugh at their own material. I'm not sure why. Maybe, to me, it seems gauche or unpracticed. A giggle here or a chuckle there isn't bad, but when the comedian laughs at his own punchline with the same length and volume as the audience, it puts me out of the set. Pete is a funny guy, but he also knows he's funny, and there are multiple moments where his delivery is swallowed up by the fact that he starts laughing half-way through the punchline. Again, this is particular to me. You might feel completely different.If you don't like comedy that deals with weighty, political, controversial, or angry topics, or if you prefer comedians to be silly, effervescent, and relentlessly cheerful, then Pete's your man. Definitely worth picking up, and it even has a high re-play value, which is a huge plus with albums like these.\n", "val": 0.003499875543639064}

{"text": "If you like Ray Wylie Hubbard's style on \"Grifter's Hymnal\" then you will like this artist. BTW, Ray Wylie helped produce this CD and thinks very highly of this young artist. I can see why, they seem to be cut from the same mold, unique vocals and great writing skills. Both storytellers to the \"nth\" degree. Durham credits Hubbard, his musical mentor with teaching him a lot of what he knows.Durham is the real deal, authentic blues-roots music for the soul. When he started out, Durham never intended to be a solo act. His solo show has been well received. \"People really started talking about it and really digging it because it's a lot of volume. I don't mean loud as in `hey, I'm going to knock you down with this.' It's just a full sound. Anyway, people started talking about that and so I thought, well, I'll just stick with what people are buzzing about so that's really what I'm doing. It was never fully intentional; it just kind of happened,\" Durham explained.I read...\"There's the redoubtable Rick Richards on drums, a sound that is central to the songs here, and a whole lot of guitar, dirty, slip-sliding, barbed wire guitars. Many of them are vintage and their heritage shows. These are guitar that have been played and loved. Durham is joined by fellow string seductors Jeff Plankenhorn, Derek O'Brien, Ray Wylie Hubbard and George Reiff. All add tone, texture and tenor to the songs on offer. Songs delivered in Durham's suitably sand-papered and distressed denim voice. These songs resonate with these times. They speak of \"living this hard\" and of \"people of the land\". They are swamp-drenched, wrecking-yard blues and rock 'n' roll vignettes drawn from the darker corners but strangely addictive and energizing.\"...By Lonesome Highway, Dec 9, 2011.He is a young talent strutting like a veteran bluesman, singing with a raw, gritty style, very brooding with dark undertones at times. Plays a rough around the edges guitar style with an even rougher vocal delivery.His material speaks for itself, very poetic at times like Hubbard, Durham wrote all eleven tunes himself. Intelligent lyrics that are distinctly his own, grassroots, gospel and soul with a huge helping of the blues. Tales of hardships and dreams lost, reeking of Hubbard's style. A laid back ride,loaded with melancholy but very listenable.\n", "val": 0.009286039508879185}

Revelation, as always, comes at the end, when Armik finally switched off his drum machine and other artificial keyboard-generated sounds and plays an insightful solo.My suggestion to Armik for the next installment: why do not you invite a good percussionist and an acoustic bassist and give us a truly naturally sound in an improvisation album?\n", "val": 0.0009385895682498813}

{"text": "5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this song, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon.  Thats right!  Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too.  In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.  Anyway...enough of my rambling.This song is great!  At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?And don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check hereFREE SONGS:From Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> FreeFREE ALBUMS:From Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Albums by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free\n", "val": 0.00654657743871212}

While admittedly I don't know much about Tony Elman, he clearly possesses talent and anyone else who collaborated on this with Tony certainly did a fantastic job as well! This is terrific not just for the holiday season but all year round! The guitar, flute and more all combine to make this a truly fine version of \"Greensleeves\" and there's a part of it that has an imaginative, jazzy flavor to it that sticks in my mind and makes me want to listen to it again.I recommend this music by Tony Elman.

Specifically what makes it a cut above is harder to quantify, but you know it when you hear it.As a poet I would rank Leroy Virgil alongside of Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark, John Hiatt, Willie Nelson, and Gordon Lightfoot. His voice is in a league all its own; best ever.The band is exceptionally tight on this album, which makes every track awesome.  Most of us have favorite tracks we skip forward to... I play this album through.There are those songs (like Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird) that you know the first time you hear them, they will be with you for life; You Better Hope You Die Young is that moving.Is it country? Is it Rock? Who cares.  I love all the Hanks, and heavy metal, and Hellbound Glory.At the end of the day they are just songs, but I agree with previous reviewers about them getting under your skin, I bought two Hellbound albums back in February, and that's pretty much all I have been interested in listening to since then.My wife in an enthusiastic fan, as well.

{"text": "As 2012 kicks into gear, Hellbound Glory get set to kick some more rear. Their third album, Damaged Goods, is a take-no-prisoners set of high energy outlaw country. Like the original outlaw country artists, Waylon, Willie, and David Allen Coe, Hellbound Glory do things their own way and don't much care for rules. But unlike the original outlaws whose central message was, \"I'm gonna do wrong, and if I hurt you in the process I'm sorry.\" Hellbound Glory's message is, \"I'm gonna do wrong - deal with it!\" With the first track on Damaged Goods, \"Bastard Child,\" they let you know where they stand: \"I was born a bastard child, but I wear it with no shame. For any good or bad I've done, I'll take the credit and the blame.\" And again in \"Til The Lights Go Out,\" they warn you that, \"This ain't my first fight in a bar parking lot.\" Listening to this album, that's easy to believe. Clearly no strangers to hard living, their songs paint a bleak picture of life on society's bottom rung. There are no happy endings in songs like, \"Knocked Off The Horse,\" \"Better Hope You Die Young,\" and \"Gonna Be A Goner.\" In each of these songs death becomes a more attractive option than living in despair. But despite the somber lyrics, the music is full of energy and attitude; as if death itself is just another barroom fight. Listening to Damaged Goods might not make you a better person, but it will certainly make you feel thankful that you're better off than some. And it will definitely keep your toe tapping along the way.\n", "val": 0.0026812527794390917}

HbG is like that for me, I listen to them with the familar beats I grew up on, the life events they sing about brings me into there stories.As I listen to the music I live the stories they tell, hearing them brings back my early rock days. I didn't even know I liked country this much, guess I do because I find myself listen to all of thier albums.I have seen them several times live, talked to the band members when they played in the parking lots after a show, because they really do like to play.

{"text": "The music of Hellbound Glory may portray a lifestyle of sticky dive bars, fights, and varieties of vices.  It's a life that the band lives and uses as musical inspiration.  So, if you are \"sensitive\" to foul language and drug/alcohol references and use, skip this one if not ... get ready for a dose on honest country music.You won't hear talk of pbr, dirt roads, pickup trucks from dudes wearing $100 jeans and earings here.  This is the darker side of country music where the heart and soul of the musician comes forth through the music b/c it's all the musician has.  No multi-million dollar contracts, no makeup artists working with them.  It's a life on the road from one dive to the next playing GREAT MUSIC.Damaged Goods is an energetic romp through life on the road, self-destruction, and relationships.  The steel guitar plays a prominent role in setting the tone of the album as does the driving energy of the drummer on the high tempo songs (ex. White Wolf).  Bar Room Beauty is a heartfelt ballad that exhibits the range of the band ... but (in my opinion) Hellbound shines when the tempo picks up and the crowd starts moving.If you like true country music, I think you will enjoy this album.

He's definitely that mental support we all secretly yearn for when things get rough and we need that critical push pass our challenges instead of being allowed to throw in the towel. I've never heard another motivational speaker like him. He doesn't get deep into your emotional baggage or where you're at in your spiritual journey, he just makes sure you know that your success is nothing more of a matter of how bad you want it. It's a tough pill to swallow but according to E.T., there's no way around it: work hard or forever fail.His YouTube clips are a great way to start the day.

Crazy I haven't noticed this before so I went about getting the song so I could enjoy it again.  I prefer to buy the digital versions and not bother trying to record from the old records.  This is the original exact version of the song that I was looking for.I want to mention buying this through Amazon instead of iTunes and other sources.  I have really grown to appreciate Amazon's service, delivery and the incredible thought they have put into their music management system.  You can buy this song, immediately listen to it via the Amazon Cloud player, but even nicer is the ability so simply click to download it and Amazon crafts a download that not only downloads the original ready to go MP3, but also imports it for you into your iTunes if you also have that installed on your system, with album art and all.

{"text": "Not the 8 minute plus 'disco' 12\" version, of course, but pretty close. Does not have the 'rap' section the 12\" version has--this appears to be the album cut--not the 3 minute AM version, either. That version was a number one hit for the Stones, their last if memory serves. This album was wildly popular. It was as if the aliens who took over the Stones in the early 70s finally up and split, and the boys got back to shaping rock and roll and stopped following trends. Sounds like making a disco version of a song in 1977ish would be following, not leading, but 'Miss You' is not a cookie cutter disco tune. It's very danceable, but then the Stones have always been the band that if your party was falling flat you put on a Stones album and that drunk girl would think she was at a Stones concert and take off her tube top. Good times. You may be able to find the 12\" version somewhere--or you might have to get one of those digitizing USB turntables and copy the 12\" to your music files. I understand that a studio remix of the 12\" is available on the UK version of a compliation disc from the 90s--not 100% sure on this.

But every so often, even with great songs around, there is a moment or two where you can be a good group, but not with the best song made.

The song honestly is fair, but comparing it to their modern-day classics like Far Away, and Savin' Me, it honestly isn't one of their better songs. Still, at leats it honestly is better than those overexposed acts like Beyonce' and Lady Gaga have forced themselves to overexpose their music to sell well, rather than letting the songs speak for themself.

The combination of Stephen Bray's beats and Michael Beckwith's wonderful messages are so uplifting, so inspiring, and so life-enhancing!!! I have started following  the words printed in the CD's insert, and, along with music, they have ascended me to higher spiritual awareness. My life has been enhanced by Beckwith's teachings on CD's and his books.  However, the rhythmicity of \"Transcendance\" provides spiritual nourishment while motivating you to move your feet, shake it and dance as well - - you REALLY feel it in your bones.  I also like that a few of the pieces can be used in a quieting meditation.

Even though I have always enjoyed his books, I was never inquisitive about his music. This CD is truly amazing and has sparked my interest in the rest of his CDs.  There are 5 tracks that I looooove.  If you want to feel good, be uplifted, and feel that you can conquer the world again, listen to \"One Day in Heaven\" and you can do just about anything!

For her latest single, 25/8, the second single from her My Life II: The Journey Continues isn't really as strong as she showed before with her music. It just wasn't as strong as her other vibes like Real Love and Be Without You had shown. I hope she does find better songs to come out with soon. Something that can be a bit more in the week than just 25/8 brought. It's alright but not really stronger with each note.Song: C+\n", "val": 2.0995687009417452e-05}

I mean it's ok...but I don't even think Drake saves this one (if you can't recall, he was also featured on Mary's first single, \"The One\" from her 2009 album).The beat is alright, the lyrics are ok and the tempo is fine.

While Be Without U was very distinctive to a broader audience, and still hits a deep nail on the head, Mr. Wrong didn't really shine from start to finish for me, as much as she could've made it to be.

{"text": "Straight No Chaser always impresses me with their incredible ability to deliver a cappella renditions of classic songs and ballads--they put their own stamp on them with their remarkable harmonizing and the members of the group never miss a beat! They possess a keen sense of timing, excellent diction and sophisticated phrasing that invariably leaves me wanting more--and this CD is no exception!There aren't too many tracks on this album which is a follow-up (Volume 2) of \"Six Pack;\" but everything we get here is top notch, high quality control singing and performing all the way through. \"Get Ready\" is quite dynamic and Straight No Chaser performs this with lots of energy right from their hearts and souls. It all works well, too--I love the sounds of their version of this song! \"Like a Prayer,\" a song I first heard by Madonna, gets the royal treatment from Straight No Chaser and I really like this number. Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" (mixed with \"Poison\") shows their ability to do a two song medley with panache and listen for yet another gem of a two song medley with \"Rhythm of Love/Can't Help Falling in Love.\" \"Buddy Holly\" is most impressive and the album ends strong with \"Let's Get It On.\" Awesome!Straight No Chaser again proves they have the vocal chops to remain a fine a cappella group for however long they wish to be performing together--and hopefully for us that will be many years to come! I highly recommend this album.\n", "val": 0.04539605975151062}

The beauty of their music is their ability to vocally mimic rhythm instruments in the background, and their ability to provide some of the tightest harmonies that I have ever heard from any group.Their rendition of Like a Prayer, is without a doubt one of the best versions ever - and I am a big Madonna fan.They are also very creative in combining two different songs togethers and blending the melodies and interweaving the tunes.  On this album, they have two compilations.  One that they pull off flawlessly - the other a rendition of Michael Jackson's Billy Jean and  Poison - this feels contrived, and the vocal pieces are not up to their normal superior flow.They do some fun tunes that I always enjoy - Buddy Holly and Let's get it on.

{"text": "Once again, I did my yearly search for decent scary sounds and music. There are so many albums to choose from that it's quite difficult to decide which one to go for, and sound quality varies considerably. However, this album encompasses the best of everything! Not only does it include some very creepy music like the Halloween Theme, it has a vast array of horror sound effects and they're all movie quality. The idea of playing this album on shuffle, or random play is clever because you get some genuine frights. There are some terrifying bangs and screams, amazing low-end rumbles that sound like they're coming from upstairs, and all of the standards you'd expect from a good Halloween SFX album; Werewolves, rattling chains, ghosts, Thunder, creaks etc. To summarize; this is a great value album with very high quality, and truly scary sounds, that will make any haunted porch or Halloween party stand out from the crowd - highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.025680065155029297}

{"text": "Aloha!  Here's the review I wrote for my free ki ho'alu (slack key guitar)  ezine:This release is a must have for any Hawaiian slack key music  lover. It includes 13 cuts with one vocal and one performed on the  autoharp. Led demonstrates his talent and skill with recordings in 6  different tunings.Although it was hard to pick, my favorite cut is his  nahenahe version of Dennis Kamakahi's Koke'e. Soft, sweet, and soothing, it  speaks louder to the soul than any vocal piece ever could. And I feel this  is why slack key music is so often moving emotionally to people... without  words, the music touches the heart and soul.Punahoa Special honors his  Uncle Fred Punahoa who recorded this in 1974 as Slack Key Instrumental #1  on The Waimea Music Festival. You may recognize Aloha Ia No O Maui which  was part of the medley titled Maui Serenade recorded in the late 1940's  (available on the History of Slack Key Guitar - Hana Ola Records). This  song was written by Maui singer Alice Johnson. Led has also included two  Tahitian songs.And surprise! A duet with Leonard Kwan. Wow! You'll love  it. George Winston accompanies on piano in 'Akaka Falls.Hopefully,  Ledward will get to come back and spend some time being inspired here in  Hawaii and writing more original music. Until then, all you folks on the  mainland can enjoy his extensive touring.\n", "val": 0.014397197403013706}

{"text": "Review of Ledward Kaapana Black Sand (Dancing Cat 38015) for Amazon. Com Ledward Kaapana is so committed to music that he hones his genius by  playing up to thirteen hours each day, alternating among several guitars  and ukuleles, a banjo, a steel guitar, an autoharp, and probably anything  else with strings.  He plays his regular gigs at the Hawaiian Regent Hotel  in Honolulu (Tuesdays from 6:00-9:00) and I Love Country Caf in Mililani  (Fridays and Saturdays whenever he doesn't have commitments on the  mainland, Asia or Europe).  Afterwards, he often drops in on other  musicians and performs as a guest, gratis.  With more than 60 album, CD,  and/or video titles to his name, Led is a prolific musician.  Although he  is only 51, Led is a living treasure who has played music since he was five  and performed professionally since he was nine.  Ledward continually  expands his horizons.  In Waltz of the Wind  (Dancing Cat, 38016, 1998) Led  entered into a musical \"discussion\" among slack key, country,  blue grass, and Cajun with some of the finest musicians of these  non-Hawaiian types.  In Hawai'i I Ka Pu'uwai (Leo Nui Productions, 1998),  Led and his group Ikona played mostly Hawaiian music, but included a  frenetic rendition of the surf song \"Pipeline.\"  In Black Sand,  Led creates another musical dialogue, this time between slack key and  classical guitar.At least three themes unify this subtly spectacular CD:  tribute to his musical mentors, tribute to places in Hawaii and other parts  of Polynesia, and the yin and yang of destruction and creation.These  are some of the mentors honored.  Uncles Fred Punahoa and Abraham Konanui  Kalauli, along with Led's own parents, first trained him as a musician.  Queen Lili'uokalani, as one of Hawai'i's greatest composers, serves as a  mentor to all musicians.  Sonny Chillingworth and Leonard Kwan preceded  Ledward as slack key greats and shared their techniques with him.  Kwan  joins Led for a duet of \"New 'Opihi Moemoe,\" Kwan's own  composition.  George Huddy lived in poverty but wrote some of the songs  that helped Led's original group Hui Ohana become what we now recognize as  the greatest Hawaiian group of all time.  Musicians from Tahiti taught  Ledward to expand his repertoire to include the music of all of Polynesia.  And living musicians and composers Keith Haugen and Dennis Kamakahi are  close friends with Led.  Led honors his producer, George Winston on their  guitar/piano duet.  Finally, two hymns, \"Kanaka Waiwai\" and  \"O Maria\" honor the ultimate Creator.Haugen's \"Mokupuni  Nui\" is the only vocal on the CD.  Its lyrics could be alternate  Hawaiian language liner notes.  Its title means \"The Big Island,\"  the island of Hawai'i where Ledward was born and raised.  The title cut,  \"Black Sand\" honors the Kalapana region where Ledward spent his  youth and teenage years.  \"Akaka Falls,\" with its water image,  depicts an area of the island of Hawaii that remains lush and fertile.  Other songs honor Mau'i,  Kaua'i, the Windward coast of O'ahu, and  Tahiti.Connected to this honoring of places is the powerful theme of  destruction and creation.  Kaimu Black Sand Beach pictured on the CD cover  is history, covered by tons of lava in the volcanic eruption that continues  to this day.  \"Ninipo Ho'onipo\" by Queen Lili'uokalani depicts  this destruction in another way by referring to the myth of Madam Pele and  Hopoe in which Madam Pele turns a captured maiden to stone.  However,  destruction is in reality part of creation.  The other regions honored in  Black Sand began as lava formations but are now such magnificent sites as  Koke'e or Akaka Falls.Akin to cosmic creation is musical creation.  In  addition to honoring his mentors and colleagues with their songs, Led  includes two of his own creations.  The title song \"Black Sand\"  is a song that Led originally wrote for Na Leo Kano O Punahele, his first  album after the break up of the Hui Ohana. \"The Highway to Hana\"  is Ledward's most complex composition yet.  In it Led, solo, both creates  harmonic effects and a surprising, almost new age sound.  This parallels  other work Led has done with George Winston, such as his accompaniment of  Kenny Loggins on a New Age song entitled \"The Island\" on the  Windham Hill anthology Wood and Steel.The flow of Black Sand emphasizes  its variety.  Led starts and ends with pure slack key songs.  However, in  between he ventures into a vocal and into classical and new age sounds.  With fifteen songs and more than an hour of sweet music, Black Sand is a CD  that gets richer and fuller with each hearing.\n", "val": 0.02690492756664753}

I used two of her songs placed in different parts of the mix.

Great album.\n", "val": 0.006728106644004583}
{"text": "Four years after Oh(Ohio) and after a very prolific '00s, Lambchop is back with another sumptuous offering of its progressive lounge music.According to interviews Kurt Wagner--possibly the most unlikely front man in popular music--composed these songs in tribute to the late Vic Chesnutt. It's not that lyrics address the loss of Chesnutt directly as far as I can tell. But two songs here--Nice Without Mercy and Kind Of--sound very much like songs written by VC that you'd find on a VC album--very slow, poetic songs with minimal accompaniment that take their time to unfurl.Everything here is very well composed, orchestrated and performed, just as you would expect from Wagner. Unlike 2008's Oh(Ohio), which to me seemed somehow unfinished and rushed, Mr. M is a lovingly crafted set. Much of the idiosyncrasy that defined the early period of the group is back, but it is incorporated seamlessly with Lambchop's post-Nixon sound. Kind Of, Buttons, 2B2 and Never My Love are my favorite tracks.Can't finish this without acknowledging drummer Scott Martin and bass player Matt Swanson...they provide a flexible, nimble foundation for Wagner's challenging songs.Perhaps a career defining release. Certainly it joins How I Quit Smoking and Is A Woman at the top of their catalog. I gave this 4 stars originally, but after several month of heavy listening I have to give Mr. M. the highest rating.\n", "val": 0.014739776961505413}

It's unique quality is one that should be heard by more people. The music is also very relaxing. I teach high school and I played this for my tenth grade students. They loved it. They all wanted to know who that band was and wanted to know more about them. This lp is definitely a timeless classic. I will be listening to it for years to come.\n", "val": 0.04362807795405388}
{"text": "Dear Music Appreciators,The only Lambchop related music I'd heard before this was the song \"65\" off a Josh Rouse/Kurt Wagner EP released way back in 1999.  Good tune, but Kurt Wagner didn't even sing on that one, so I'm pretty much a Lambchop virgin.Now that I've  finally gotten around to officially meeting this band (through this, their latest record) I'm not 100% sure how I feel about them personally.  This may be a relationship I want to pursue, or I may decide it's just too much work and (despite a very real brilliance factor) let them drift off my radar forever.  Time will tell, but in the meantime, here are some thoughts on what the new record MR. M has to offer:Kurt Wagner seems to be the kind of guy who does what he wants artistically-speaking - the kind of guy who can drop an F bomb in the first line of the first song and then proceed carefully through fifty-six minutes of subtly beautiful and uniquely unconventional songs on love and loss without missing a beat.  String and woodwind arrangements, piano, and gently played acoustic instruments abound here.  The vocals are delivered in a blunt, matter-of-fact conversational style.  The lyrics are poetic - \"And I won't be connected/or be easily infected/by the growing sense of self-inflected routine in our day\"These songs take their time and true to their creator, they do seem to do whatever they want.  Some are purely instrumental, some literally almost put me to sleep the first time around, a few are instant accessible, but all the songs on this album reward the dedicated music appreciator by slowly revealing their true qualities over the course of repeated listening.If I had to choose one word to describe my impression of the music on MR. M the word would be...Cinematic.With or without words, these songs seem to be patiently telling a story and weaving a tapestry of tone that could easily drape itself along the soundtrack of an art house picture about life or love or loss with a capital \"L.\"  I say \"an art house picture\" because this is evocative and thoughtful music for thoughtful people and I'm guessing any future decisions about whether or not I wanna get my Lambchop on will depend on  how thoughtful I'm feeling at the time, and unless you're already a dedicated fan, perhaps it will depend on the same thing for you too.Sincerely,Constant Listener\n", "val": 0.006785303819924593}

{"text": "When it has came down to what Rihanna had shown musically, it honestly has been too tongue and cheek, not even close to enough of her voice. Sadly, it has also drowned out her talent she had in her, and made her one of the most overexposed artists of the past several years. Her latest song We Found Love from her album Talk That Talk, feels like it is a weak mouse, that lacks in the polish she brought in when she came out in 2005 with Pon De Replay. I really felt it showed poorly just like the songs from her Loud and Rated R records had shown. I think personally for Rihanna, she should take a long break and find herself all over again. Then, she could fins a way to talk that talk for her fans, and for herself.Song: D+\n", "val": 2.1124771592440084e-05}

{"text": "You know... every single damn time I hear anybody take a chance with Euro-trance these days (in a major US single), it always strikes me as MA$$IVE, and it's no different this time: it's BEYOND massive; the song has all all kinds of game. The problem is that Euro-trance simply doesn't move the units here in the states, a thing which has LONG left me scratching my head. I mean, I really just don't get that: trance moves HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of SKU's in Europe, and yet here in the US it basically amounts to a rounding error amidst aggregate sales for the majors.This time, however, I think we might actually get a shot at seeing some trance break heavily on the American big chart -- WHERE is an engraved invitation to re-mixers, for starters, plus with 60 million VEVO views at YouTube (in 45 days!) you can't really say it didn't get a push... although it really does sound (to my ears, anyways) as if it were crafted (much) more for the singles charts in Europe. I am genuinely a bit surprised they decided to drop this to American radio (although I am glad that they did).Tell you something: What the people behind the board here have done is to take basic trance breakdowns and \"punk-ify\" them. Listen closely, and tell me you can't hear the punk buried in there. Listen again. That's a punk riff done in trance, my friends (and sterilized for US radio). Oh YES, it absolutely IS. Stop arguing with me, here. Listen again, and listen FOR THE PUNK. Too, the timing & arrangement of R's vox strike me as following the syllabification pattern of Adele's ROLLING IN THE DEEP. YES, again, I'm telling that's EXACTLY why it sounds so familiar at first listen. Stop arguing with me, already -- you KNOW I'm right. It's a by-the-numbers hit done mostly by the book, but with enough different (the punk influence buried within the electronica, in particular) to make it damned interesting.It's good work; the whole thought process here is brilliant.It's a Euro single made accessible for the US market.Rihanna: more of this, please.\n", "val": 9.086261707125232e-05}
{"text": "The song itself is a bit \"drive on the coatails\" of \"We Found Love\". A definite club song, well engineered for FM, it's classic Rihanna in this stage of her career stating with Only Girl In The World. If nobody has noticed, radio is now more driven by the beats and Dance Hall/House/ Trance influences now, vs the heavy Hip Hop/Rap that was a few years early. The european influence has finally moved into our top 40 frame of mind with a vengence. (take her work with David Guetta, Jump Smokers, etc).This is moving fast on the dance charts.This will not be the blockbuster of lets say \"We Found Love\", but is a good 10 5 single. As many have stated, she may no be getting a bit overexposed, but it does not diminish her talents of the strength of her music. This is a good single, well worth listening to, and will be on many a DJ's list, But for the future, it's time to seek out other styles as well, maybe a few back to her Barbados routes, or more unique duets, (no more Chris Browns please). Also we have not really scenne a definitive ballad from her yet,.This young lady is sooo talented...her management needs to look at her next 5 years more rather then the quick cash in. Her talent is just to damn good.UPDATES..now the single is of the \"past\" and the predictions were correct. While very popular. it did not achieve #1 (Billboard charts), and was a club favorite, especially the remixes. Her next album and singles as I hoped changed styles, the first a bit more mainstream ( Diamonds) , then R&B and raw (Rude Boy type)(Pour it Up), and now a top 5 excellent ballad, As usual with reviews of superstars, it you dare to not say \" excellent\" or \"love her\" you get negatives.  I do have all her releases, Club mixes included, and will continue to buy them. She is the type of artist that you can buy unheard, she is that good.\n", "val": 0.007725558243691921}
{"text": "There is no doubt that Rihanna has really been suffering musically with lackluster songs and overexposure. Her music has taken a turn for the worse, and that overexposure is really gotten to her voice. Where Have You Been, the 3rd single from her lackluster record Talk That Talk, is really not at the par she could make in her voice. She feels very robotic, and not really in tune with trying to set herself apart from her past songs like Umbrella and Only Girl In The World. I really was not very impressed with the song, and I feel Rihanna has a lot more to prove in her voice, than repeating herself in beats. Honestly, she should take a break from singing, and find a different tune and then she will know where she has been.Song: D-\n", "val": 2.162449345632922e-05}

I know the sample doesn't truly tell you much about the song, but that sample was enough to do for me. I thought You Da One would have the same sound and that I would hate it. I was wrong, just from hearing the 30 second sample, I loved it. I purchased this song a few days ago and I've listened to it continuously since then. I recommend this song...I'm not sure to who, but I say it's good and has the potential to be a hit, especially since it's not full of the vulgar lyrics that she as been trying to push lately. This song definitely has some qualities that remind me of Umbrella, not sure it'll explode the same though. So yeah, that's my review.\n", "val": 0.024881945922970772}

Her latest single from her album Talk That Talk, You Da One is absolutely poor. She really doesn't have the strike in her voice that she once had awhile ago. I honestly think Rihanna needs to definitely take a very long break from singing and find herself as a growing woman all over again.

{"text": "When it has came down to Rihanna, musically she has made some of the worst song out there for the past several years. She has been so overexposed, and yet she still needs to really find her voice. Her latest song, Birthday Cake from Talk That Talk was really short absolutely disgraceful from start to finish. Not only is it terrible and short, but what really gets me angry is the remix of her song, as she collaborates with the man whom had assaulted her and abused her at The Grammy awards 3 years ago, Chris Brown. It definitely has wasted Rihanna's credibility away as a performer by a lot, and when I said she really needs to find her voice, she definitely doesn't feel like she has one anymore. Maybe, Rihanna should just go away for a long while, then come back as a real singer.Song: F\n", "val": 4.838511085836217e-05}

It amazon looks at the results, they loose more in customer goodwill and business then worrying about someone copying it then \"returning\" it.

Sadly, instead of taking her time and finding the right notes, she has rushed herself into making another mediocre set of songs with Talk That Talk, and her latest single Where Have You Been, hasn't really been as driven or inspiring as she could've made it out to be in her voice.

{"text": "What a treat, and especially for the bargain price. Usually collections like this are filled with marginal selections - B-side stuff - or familiar tunes performed by unfamiliar bands. This, however, is the real thing: a collection of some of swing's most recognized anthems performed by some of the iconic bands of the era.Like many bargain-priced collections, though, a few songs slip in that do not really fit. In the case of this collections a few tracks of jump blues, very early R&B and even proto rock managed to get included. Probably because those tracks swung and were from the era. I am not complaining because even those tracks are great. If you are wondering which, they are the ones by Louis Jordan, Roy Brown, Julia Lee & Her Boy Friends, and Ella Mae Morse. Click on their sample tracks above to hear what I am talking about.My only complaint - it it's more of a wish than a complaint - is THE swing anthem, Sing, Sing, Sing, is missing. But then, had they included any rendition except Benny Goodman's January 16, 1938 Carnegie Hall concert I would have complained about that. The truth is with or without my favorite performance of a personal favorite song, this album is an absolute bargain and over five hours of swinging joy. I'd be a jerk to quibble. Especially given the selection of tracks and the great sound quality.\n", "val": 5.652042091242038e-05}

{"text": "The Assassin's Creed games for me have often been just as much about ambiance and setting as story and in the past, music has figured largely in my estimation of the games overall.  Revelations had good music, but compared to other installments in the series, I found it a weaker entry, though I did enjoy the varied instrumentation and styles offered.  I love both Jesper Kyd and Lorne Bafle for bringing their unique and wonderful styles to the table, but I just didn't feel like it was their best.  I love the music, but I simply like AC 2 and 3 better and found the tracks more memorable.  With Revelations, for the most part, I found myself enjoying the music in-game, but forgotten when I turned the game off.  I did have my share of favorites, mostly the quiet, contemplative tracks, but also enjoyed some of the more thrilling tracks that with their intensity, set the mood for the action of the game.  Favorites include the hauntingly beautiful Main Theme, the calming and slow-paced Byzantium, the lighthearted Fight or Flight, and of course the sweeping masterpiece of sound that is Labored and Lost.  All in all, another intriguing offering in the Assassin's Creed musical line-up.  If you enjoyed the tunes in-game, then I definitely recommend the soundtrack.\n", "val": 0.016605418175458908}
{"text": "Jesper Kyd has begun to replace the household name of Hans Zimmer for me, simply because he has the ability to tell a story already being worked out on screen, and the re-telling simply adds layers and dimentions the average gamer takes in stride as the expected result from a game title that has a rising star. But without the music of Jesper there would be no Ezio Auditori da Firenze. That character would have passed by like thousands of others in the history of gaming.Instead he is a vibrant, likeable character and that is a debt that Ubisoft owes to Jesper for finding the tone for him and for his time. The progression of the themes (from AC2 - AC Revelations) is so interesting because just as Ezio becomes more seasoned and refinded as first a passionate youth, then a dedicated middle age (for the time period) freedom fighter and finally a old veteran with the expereince and seasoning that only age can bring, so do his themes.First simple but honest, then with a hint of darkness and danger mixed in (in Brotherhood) and finally by the time of this game he is simply Ezio, not Ezio the Assassin, and his music story reflects that growth. When he fights the music reflects refinement and not a movement wasted, when he is stalking it reflects patience and almost an enjoyment of the hunt, when he takes the time to interact with fellow Assassins or other friends it shows humor, respect, compassion and appreiciation for those around him, and woven though all there is the theme of the city he is in, coloring all that he sees, and giving you a glimps into the impression it leaves on him. Lorne Balfe has a few incredible moments in this soundtrack as well, and possibly if the themes had been his they might show more refinement but for the true talent here the set and its most rich peices belong primarily to Jesper. Great Music!!!\n", "val": 0.018161999061703682}

{"text": "The Assassin's Creed franchise has been one that has always kept trucking along these past years. The game, while quite fresh and new at the start, has begun to wear thin as most games do after half a dozen entries. One constant aspect of the games though has always been Jesper Kyd. Jesper has been the voice of this franchise from the beginning, and fans all over have identified his sound with the franchise. So, I found it quite interesting that Lorne Balfe of all people joined the franchise very late in the game. While I have loved everything Jesper has done so far to this point I can't deny I was looking forward to what Lorne was going to bring to the table. Lorne had apparently done a trailer for the game and the folks at Ubisoft loved it so much that they asked him to join Jesper and give the game a cinematic flair. With Lorne Balfe coming off the successful Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 he was ripe for the job. Now here's the interesting part; the two composers have never met or have even talked.It seems that Lorne did his stuff and Jesper did his own, and neither of them knew what the other was doing. So with that in mind I find that the overall experience is quite impressive. This game has lots of music and a lot of it is represented here in this 3 disc's worth release. Jesper's signature sound mixed in with Lorne's grander textures combine to make one great experience. Lorne gives the game an anchoring theme and an overall cinematic scope while Jesper keeps the story flowing through the gameplay segments. It's a great 1-2 combo and given that the composers never discussed their approaches I find it incredible the result is what it is. There are some discernable contrasting styles, which has to be expected. So the flow maybe isn't as good as it could have been if the two worked together. Then again if you were to listen to the score not knowing the information I already told you then you'd be hard pressed to tell of any flow problems. The execution is top notch and in the end makes for a worthy listen even if 3 disc's worth can be a bit exhausting.Assassin's Creed fans will enjoy the soundtrack immensely as it expands on the world Jesper has built over the past games. Lorne adds some new flavors that are most welcome, and the textures he brings give it a fresher feel. While Jesper Kyd is totally capable of handling the franchise on his own I'm always in the mindset of \"the more the merrier\". The 3 discs may grow tiresome for a few, but if you want to enjoy some great cultural flavors I say jump on in.

Jesper Kydm along with Lorne Balfe, put together some amazing compositions! I've been listening to it now for two solid months as both background music while I am at home and also while I am writing or studying. Get the Complete Collection if you can afford it.  The only downside is that I did notice at least one missing track from the game;  this is the one that is during the wagon chase near the beginning of the game.  Other than that, the music will definitely not disappoint!\n", "val": 0.01774970442056656}
{"text": "There are no spoilers here just a review. I will get rid of the negatives that I have for this soundtrack first and then move on to the positives.I was extremely excited for a new Assassin's Creed game. Not only because of more gripping story but for more beautifully composed Jesper Kyd tracks that in my mind is essential to telling the story of this game. I was a bit let down after seeing that out of 80 tracks, Jesper Kyd has composed only 30.Enter Lorne Balfe. New composer to Assassin's Creed. Lorne has composed the other 50 tracks to this game. Though it seems out of those 50 tracks, 26 are actually included in the story. The other 24 tracks are songs that accompany the multiplayer aspect of Assassin's Creed Revelations.Where do I begin with with Lorne? Well first, let me just say this is in no way a review to bash the guy. I enjoyed some of his music but obviously enjoyed more Jesper Kyd's music. Lorne seems to have come out of nowhere. The first I even heard of him and his music was the ujam contest to have your voice be in one ACR's songs. I listened to his ACR theme and got my first taste of his style. Thankfully, it worked. The ACR theme that was featured on ujam was a beautiful dreamy song and with the winner Madeline providing vocals made it even better. They really made the right choice picking her. Her voice is angelic and perfect. I was looking forward to what he had to offer after I heard the ACR theme...that is until I actually played the game and heard his music.Jesper Kyd has created a distinct sound within the Assassin's Creed series that is extremely hard to replicate, even harder to overshadow and impossible to imagine not in an AC game. Lorne's music however is easily forgettable. It just seems like most of his songs he tried to go overly epic with strings possibly in an attempt to make the game sound Hans Zimmer-y? However, for me this only worked in the intense action parts of the game where the main focus is the action going on in the game. His forgettable music essentially makes most of his contributions hard to listen to outside of the game as opposed to Jesper's more versatile tracks that you can easily listen to in almost any situation. By \"forgettable music\" I mean there's no real melody to it to go back and hum to at any given time besides his ACR theme. Yes the ACR theme he created was beautiful and stands out as his best work here. Unfortunately, Lorne has overused his own theme throughout the game.(Granted, Jesper is guilty of this too in the AC2 soundtrack but thankfully since then he's rectified this.)Out of 26 of Lorne's tracks that were in the story of ACR, I count 17 songs that are either blatantly re-using or in some way re-using his ACR theme. By the end of the game a once beautiful and meaningful track became annoying. He overused it way too much and that sort of ruined the experience of certain scenes of ACR for me. I understand that it is the actual theme of the game and perhaps it should be strewn here and there to make reference to it but to rely too heavily on one track to lay the foundation for the majority of your work in a game's soundtrack is a definite \"no-no\" for obvious reasons. I would've been content with maybe 3-4 tracks using the theme. One short cut of it in the start of the game, 2  medium cuts of it randomly dispersed at important moments in the middle of the story and the true full ACR theme playing at the end. I was honestly expecting more from Lorne but instead I got the same theme over and over in different tempos and different accompanying string melodies.That isn't to say I disliked all his music. For sure Lorne's \"Assassin's Creed Revelations Theme\" stood out as his best work. Besides that one song there is another I'm assuming he composed that I absolutely loved but is NOT IN THIS SOUNDTRACK. It is featured in Desmond's journey part 4: Metropolis. My only description for the sound of the song is it sounds like something out of Tron Legacy. Very club/trance. The song fit perfectly within the context of what occurs in Desmond's Journey part 4. Noteworthy tracks that are either entirely devoid of the ACR theme with some originality or having little of the theme within that I enjoyed:-Master and Mentor-Scheduled for Deletion-Labored and Lost-Abstergo Industries\"Master and Mentor\" especially, felt like the type of work I was expecting from Lorne. Giving that \"prince of persia/arabian nights\" feeling. But as with most of Lorne's work on this soundtrack, his talent shined only few times between and the majority just wasn't enough. As I said, besides his ACR theme I really can't listen to any of his music OUTSIDE of the game. It just doesn't seem suited for casual listening. Which is fine since it's a game but at least with Jesper's music anyone can listen to his tracks no problem. Lorne Balfe has potential and I hear in the songs he can do much better.but given this first \"stab\"(wink-wink :P) at the series, it just doesn't seem like Lorne's style is suited to the AC series. I really hope Lorne isn't \"taking over\" for Jesper. In a recent interview Jesper declined comment on a question that was asked \"If he was going to be working on AC3's soundtrack.\" Maybe I'm too used to Jesper Kyd's music or simply have been spoiled for 4 games now that I'm being a fanboy and won't accept anything but Jesper's music in an AC game....or maybe because Jesper knows exactly how to immerse players into the beautiful world ubisoft has created?Onto Jesper. Jesper has struck one out of the park here. I can almost say he has even surpassed the greatness that is the first Assassin's Creed soundtrack...ALMOST but CLOSE. This is now my new second favorite Assassin's Creed soundtrack with the ACB soundtrack in 3rd.(Didn't enjoy AC2 soundtrack as much.)Jesper knows how to \"take you there\". With each of his tracks you are instantly transported to the streets of Constantinople, to the middle of a swordfight or exploring one of ACR's underground locations. Literally, ALL of Jesper Kyd's work is amazing in this soundtrack. ALL. But to get a quick feel as to where he is going with the soundtrack(at least on his end), YT the noteworthy tracks and listen to them fully(samples don't give you the full taste):-Istanbul-Welcome to Konstantiniyye-Byzantium-The Wounded Eagle-Street FightI could add several detailed paragraphs here of my complete and utter praise for each of Jesper Kyd's tracks but I will try to keep it to a minimum. I can't stress enough how much Jesper puts you there in the game. His music in itself is an Animus allowing you to travel in time to another part of the world. \"Welcome to Konstantiniyye\" and \"Istanbul\" are PRIME examples of this. For some reason those songs in particular gave me the same kind of childhood joy and excitement that I got when I watched \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" as a kid since part of the Baron's adventures took place in that same part of the world.(At least I think, it's been awhile since I re-watched it.)In short, this is a GREAT and worthwhile soundtrack. Despite my problems with Lorne, OVERALL when the music is listened to within the game the soundtrack WORKS. Most of Lorne's tracks(besides the ACR theme and some others) may not be listenable outside of the game but at least Jesper Kyd's work on here will leave you more than satisfied. In a way, I'm kind of glad Lorne was brought on board since the extra \"help\" allowed Jesper more focus on creating these amazing tracks.One star is detracted for Lorne's overuse of the ACR theme, for incompleteness, ie: the exclusion of one of Lorne's songs in Desmond's Journey Part 4:Metropolis(that was actually good), not having enough Jesper Kyd tracks and not being available on cd AFTER 4 GAMES with better audio quality. Definitely worth the purchase and listen though.<<EDIT>>I just wanted to do a quick blurb on the music of the multiplayer. The tracks I refer to are Lorne Balfe's tracks on disc 3, tracks 1-24. These are tracks that will only be heard during the multiplayer aspect of Assassin's Creed Revelations. I recently had a chance to play up until level 34 on the multiplayer and have familiarity with the tracks by now.On their own the tracks may be difficult to listen to since most are very short and suddenly loud active tracks. Within the multiplayer itself....some tracks work most tracks don't. To help people understand a little better I need to explain the object of the multiplayer itself.In ACR's multiplayer there are a variety of different modes to play. In an effort to constrain reading time I'll explain one mode called \"WANTED\". In this mode everyone is automatically assigned a target to kill. The target's image profile is in a corner of the screen and you are given a small compass as to around what area your target is located in. Essentially it is about killing. But you can't just run up to a target and simply kill. No. The object of the game is to slowly and inconspicuously approach your target stealthily without attracting attention. This approach will garner the most points and put you in first place if done correctly. If the target spots you or you approach too quickly you will be entered in a chase and have no choice but to run and kill that target in which doing so will net you the least points. All these kills have to be done while avoiding other players who are trying to kill you in the same way.Now the object of the multiplayer is stealth. Not exactly a cod run and kill type multiplayer. Although it can be for the most part it is not. Why Lorne Balfe decide to make most of the music very loud and difficult to hear anyone approaching. That's another thing, as a pursuer approaches, there will be these freaky whispers starting to slowly grow louder. It acts as a warning. A very small countermeasure to discern anyone approaching you that may be acting suspiciously. I relied on the whispers and have easily spotted many pursuers and stunned them. But there are points in a session where Lorne's music is completely drowning out the whispers. Quite annoying and unhelpful if you have this loud overly epic music playing when the multiplayer is supposed to be about slowly approaching targets.As I said some music works most don't. The times the music does work is when a chase is activated(you are being chased or you are chasing someone) and in other modes of the multiplayer where it isn't all about stealth.I hate to continue to be negative about Lorne but it's just my personal opinion. He's worked with Hans Zimmer quite a few times and once on call of duty modern warfare game. Maybe that's where he failed for me in the multiplayer music. He made it too overly epic like some cod game. Assassin's Creed IS NOT cod. While it may be a compliment to say someone's music sounds too Zimmer-y, within the context of Assassin's Creed it is not. Zimmer sounding music doesn't fully work in AC. It's a good substitute but nothing can replace Jesper Kyd.\n", "val": 0.00044013361912220716}
{"text": "The beginning half of the song is catchy with Will.i.am doing the main rap, and Jennifer Lopez doing the background lyrics (mainly echoing \"You can go hard, or you can go home\"). In the second part of the track, the lyrics \"This is hard,\" and Mick Jagger does the rest. I honestly thought it was will.i.am with a more harsh tone in his voice until I saw the video. Anyway, the track is catchy, but when it comes to Mick Jagger's part, I'm indifferent, partially because the lyrics seem rather uninspiring for someone as monumental like Mick Jagger.\"Hard like a rock and roll, time bombs ticking, explode! Baby this is dy-na-mo, better move up now, it's about to blow! Hard like geometry, trigonometry, this is craz-ay! Psychology. Yea baby, about to win, what's that now? I'm going in! You can hard, or you can go home (7x) You can go haaaa-wd!\" I personally would have preferred to see someone less iconic doing such nonsense lyrics, but that's just my opinion.\n", "val": 4.309646101319231e-05}

{"text": "This is a must have if you are not familiar with zarzuela (Madrid's response to Vienna's operetta). It's a nice combination of arias sung by Caballe in beautiful voice and joined by her husband tenor Bernabe Marti for the duets. The CD comes with translations for non Spanish speaking which will greatly improve your satisfaction.Caballe is in as beautful voice as ever and feels at home with this non very taxing repertoire. She doesn't overindulge in her other times frequent \"floatiness\" and is very expressive throughout. Thogh sometimes when some coloratura is needed she tends to drop the consonants blurring her enunciation of the words. We are used to this from her opera recordings though she's not as bad as Sutherland.Marti is a nice tenor but is not in the same league as Caballe. That's why he never got star recognition though he made a few recordings whith his wife, like Bellini's \"Il Pirata\". His is a lyrical tenor, a little throaty but with nice projection of the sound. He sounds a little strained over the \"passagio\" but hits all the notes. More importantly, he compensates for his lack of vocal lustre with burning impersonations of his characters. Passionate and burning in some, tender and caressing in others. In this respect is better than his wife who is a little more doll like hidding behind her vocal resources. So I specially enjoyed the many and varied duets in this recording.Strongly recommended.\n", "val": 0.020519321784377098}

{"text": "If you need to fill holes in your Schumann collection, or you're looking to replace that lost or broken CD.  Or, if you've never bought a Schumann CD or MP3, then this is the collection for you - at $1.99 you can hardly go wrong.  You can't beat the price with a stick and you get hours and hours of quality music by one of the greatest Romantic composers of all time. This of course includes The Spring Symphony No. 1, as well as Symphonies 2, 3 & 4, Kinderzenen,  Kreisleriana, Moonlit Night and the Grand Sonata amongst others.  This is music at it's best!  Schumann was clearly a genius, and it shows on the tracks on this MP3 download.  Use it for relaxing, meditation, or as the background for your life.  It's simply beautiful!  His piano music is especially divine.FOR THE MUSIC PURISTS:  Use this to fill holes in your collection - it's so cheap, it's almost like stealing.  There's so much here that you can't go wrong, even if some aren't perfectly executed.FOR EVERYONE ELSE: Use this to build your collection.  There are at least 8 other MP3 downloads like this one which would start the basis for a lovely classical music library. If you get to the point where a piece doesn't sound right, or bothers you in any way, go out and explore alternatives.  There are tons out there.  What I like, you may not, and vice versa.  For example, the only people I like play Rachmaninoff are Rachmaninoff and Mischa Dikter.  Yet, I'm told a lot of people play him well - I just don't agree.  It's all personal taste.  Take recommendations, but figure out what you like yourself. At $1.99 each, that makes it under $18.00 to have 1800 tracks of 9 classical masters, ranging from Bach to Debussy.  You can't even buy a family of 4 fastfood for that little.  Or you could buy 18 tracks on i-tunes, not 1800.  I can tell you, I did it, and it's been the soundtrack to the greater part of my life since I did so.  It especially makes wonderful background music while reading anything from fiction to nonfiction - and of course making dinner.  You can't beat this deal - just buy this!  Buy all of them!

The tempos are swift throughout, but the playing is crystal clear and does get weighty when needed. Personally, I like an even-weightier account of this music. I like my brass to sound regal, rather than punchy. But one can't deny that the orchestral playing is super, that the choirs are all well balanced, that the voicings are superb and that the musical gestures one expects are made, if at a quicker tempo than one is used to hearing. This is a great cycle for those who find Schumann to be lugubrious or overwrought. None of that here, and a MUCH cheaper way to acquire the cycle than through buying it on CD at $14 a pop.Major piano pieces are also included, also in excellent sound.The rest of the set is good, though I wonder why the Piano Quintet is absent.Highly recommended at 10 times the price.\n", "val": 0.03072974644601345}

{"text": "Ann Sweeten returns refreshed and renewed with a collection of tranquil piano tunes that seek to move beyond the pressures of the past and look ahead to the future with determination.Once again, Sweeten turns to producer Will Ackerman and his Imaginary Road Studios in Vermont to provide a crisp, state-of-the-art recording that brings out the nuanced subtleties of Sweeten's masterful keyboard skills. This gives the CD the sense of an up-close-and-personal performance at an intimate venue.Sweeten is joined on this outing by Ackerman on guitar, Trisha Craig on flute, Akane Setiawan on English horn and oboe, Andrew Eng on viola and violin, and Liz Ehrman on cello. These musicians are as masterful in their restraint as they are in their technique, perfectly accentuating the piano-based focus of the music and providing just a hint of embellishment in keeping with the overall quietude of the album.As usual, Sweeten's compositions are striking and beautiful, complemented by Sweeten's gorgeous performances. Some of her playing is simple and understated, and some of it is very complex and involved. But it is all effortlessly and expertly controlled, evidence of a true maestro at work. The result is a perfect mental getaway and a fine listening experience.\n", "val": 0.045106060802936554}
{"text": "When sounds suggest and instil your words with a kind of modest sense of grateful appreciation, it seems quite impossible to say something that hasn't already been so well communicated by the music itself. Ms. Sweeten's ninth full musical adventure offers more mature heartfelt touches which  make the Steinway piano (A baby grand - model B) a palette far more delicate and pristine than any intimate prayer to celebrate the gift of life. Sometimes her fingers simply take the flight and the keys become aery strings vibrating and asking us to vibrate with them. Her new eleven wordless instrumentals haunt us asking to escape from the humdrum of so many contemporary bombastic musical productions. Therefore, no words? Well, there are the usual ones from the artist's intimate block notes and, actually, they seem quite enough to give \"rhymes and reasons\". Music and poetry, being both linked to life most exquisite moments, go hand in hand and thread the same paths of solitary contemplation of natural, peaceful,  breathtaking environments. Who is still afraid of the soothing and evocative power of those two magical ebony and ivory strings, when they let your heart spring towards those very private spaces within your consciousness? Why should delicate melancholy keep you from crying with a smile? Here again, pauses and touches reverberate in a continuous passionate relationship with space and silence. We can but wait to be enchanted track after track, just to long to rewind the story again and again. I really don't know whether such a thing called \"empathic listening\" could actually exists even in the difficult world of music consumerism, but  I feel Ms. Sweeten's way of telling her emotions is something which comes so close to that unspeakable way of communicating life through the musical language. French Romanticism is an obvious classical reference but it is useless to start tracing influences, because it would be better to state how her way of playing is far from any sophisticated, algid new age product, indeed, a difficult thing to say for most of contemporary piano solo efforts.In my opinion Ann Sweeten's outstanding technique comes forth at its best in most of the tracks, thanks to the customary impeccable production by William Ackerman who could not avoid adding his unobtrusive guitar to a couple of tracks (Was it yesterday?, Out of Embers) . Besides, the new engineer at Imaginary Road Studios, Tom Eaton is well in the shadow of Corin Nelsen. As a matter of fact, even when the gentle, discreet coming of an oboe, a flute, an English horn or a violin, a cello, a viola, might risk to relegate the piano nuances in the background, the other guests musicians (Trisha Craig, Akane Setiawan, Andrew Eng, Liz Ehrman) side it like acolytes who come to share the pianist's steadfast will to pour down in notes her joy de vivre, in spite of...anything. In other words, while the piano weaves patiently each present moment on the array of time people often call simply \"stave\", occasional echoes from Ann's past emotional battles come back to add flavour and experience, thus enhancing the range of suasion and calm, dreamy response. No wonder her previous \"piano offerings\" have been consoling and almost aurally healing thousands of hearts so far. As listeners we can just keep trembling In the Wake and look forward for the next chapter!

{"text": "In a recording career that has spanned 14 years and includes 9 best selling albums and 2 Italian compilations, Ann Sweeten has managed to achieve a level of success that many musicians only dream of. In addition to her music consistently placing high on the charts, receiving extensive radio airplay, and winning numerous awards, she holds the prestigious title of an official \"Steinway Artist/ Composer,\" placing her in the company of some of the most distinguished pianists in the world.Her latest release, \"In The Wake,\" is a showcase for the skills that have elevated her to such lofty musical heights. The album is co-produced by Windham Hill Records founder and Grammy award winning producer Will Ackerman, who also plays guitar on two tracks. Additional instrumentation includes flute, English horn, oboe, violin, violoa, and cello, all of which are used sparingly to lightly season and subtly enhance the flavor of her rich piano compositions. Among her inspirations she lists one of my all-time favorite pianists, Suzanne Ciani, as well as composers Stephen Sondheim, Erik Satie, Tchaikovsky, and Debussy, revealing her classical background and new age influences.As I put on the CD to listen, the heartfelt warmth of the opening notes, inspired me to draw in a deep breath and settle back to luxuriate in the elegant music that was unfolding. Delicate acoustic guitar by Will Ackerman shadowed Ann's playing with graceful understatement on the first song, Mid-way through, an airy flute soars above the rising and falling melody like a sea bird gliding just above the waves. On the solo piano composition, \"Metamorphosis,\" I appreciated the contrast between spaciousness and Ann's tinkling harp-like glissandos that adorned the arrangement. On the wistful \"Love Remembered\" violin and viola add a poignant touch to the ambience. The last song on the recording, \"Now, and Again,\" makes a fitting finale as oboe and cello intertwine with Ann's exquisite piano artistry in a piece that would make an enchanting film soundtrack. Her music is both contemplative and emotionally evocative, providing a world-class listening experience.\n", "val": 0.037879470735788345}
{"text": "\"In the Wake,\" a metaphor for life, is pianist/composer Ann Sweeten's ninth album (plus two Italian compilations). Co-produced by Will Ackerman (who plays guitar on two tracks) and recorded at Ackerman's Imaginary Road Studios, the album features several acoustic instrumentalists on strings, flute, oboe, and English horn. Sweeten's graceful touch and fluid playing style are beautifully expressed on a Steinway baby grand (model B), and the sound quality of the music is flawless. Often tinged with melancholy, Sweeten's compositions have a dreamy quality that encourages the listener to kick back and just listen for a while, becoming immersed in the music and soothed by the gentle waves of sound. Ann Sweeten draws from vast life experience in the arts with her acting, singing, and dancing in addition to her music. She is also a staunch environmentalist, animal activist, and vegetarian. With so many means of self-expression available to her, it is no wonder that her music communicates so effortlessly.\"In the Wake\" begins with \"Was It Yesterday?\" a nostalgic ballad for piano, guitar, and flute (Trisha Craig). Wistful and dreamy, the gentle flow of the three instruments sets a mood of calm repose and reflection. \"Falling Leaves\" becomes even more soothing and relaxed, and Akane Setiawan's English horn adds the perfect counterpoint to Sweeten's graceful piano. \"Metamorphosis\" weaves a series of musical themes together to create a lovely tapestry that tells a story of change and inter-relatedness. Sometimes flowing and almost harp-like, sometimes quite rhythmic, and sometimes quiet and still, it is a very effective piece. \"Love Remembered\" is an introspective daydream with a passionate undercurrent. Andrew Eng on violin and viola enhances the poignance of this piece. As the title suggests, \"A Chance for Goodbye\" is deeply emotional and sad, and Liz Ehrman's cello is the perfect accompaniment to the piano. \"On Wings of Light\" feels lighter and more optimistic, and Setiawan's English horn keeps the piece soaring to new heights. \"Out of Embers,\" Ackerman's second appearance, is a favorite. Exquisitely gentle and dreamy, it seems to tell of hope and renewal - beautiful! My favorite track on this album is the more classical \"October Sky,\" a passionate and bittersweet piece for piano and viola that would be an amazing tear-jerker in a movie soundtrack. \"Now and Again\" closes the album much as it began - wistful and peaceful. Cello and oboe make this a gorgeous, heartfelt trio that leaves the listener feeling refreshed and renewed.\"In the Wake\" is sure to be another chart-topper for Ann Sweeten! Recommended!\n", "val": 0.03291436657309532}

{"text": "The fourth of the projected five Twilight movies, Breaking Dawn Part I is the first of a two-part series concluding the cinematic saga based on Stephanie Meyer's massively popular horror-romance novels. Teen heartthrobs Robert Pattinson, Kristin Stewart and Taylor Lautner return as Edward, Bella and Jacob, the three protagonists in the never-ending love triangle between a vampire, a werewolf and the human object of their desires. The story revolves around Edward and Bella's marriage and her subsequent pregnancy with a half-human half-vampire baby; not only does she have to contend with the implications of this hybrid, but Jacob's werewolf clan - mortal enemies of the Cullen vampires - are planning to kill Bella and her unborn child before it becomes a threat to them. The film is directed by Bill Condon, and features the usual supporting cast - Nikki Reed, Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Kellen Lutz, Ashley Greene, Jackson Rathbone - as well as Michael Sheen as the leader of the enigmatic vampire clan, the Volturi.Returning to the fray is composer Carter Burwell, who scored the original first blockbuster, but was replaced by Alexandre Desplat on the second film, New Moon, and by Howard Shore on the third film, Eclipse. Burwell's return to the series was at the behest of director Condon, with whom Burwell worked on Gods and Monsters in 1998 and Kinsey in 2004, and which resulted in two of Burwell's career-best works. Regular readers will know that I didn't care a whole lot for the original Twilight score, finding myself \"not part of this score's target demographic\". Both New Moon and Eclipse were distinct improvements for me, moving away from the harshness of Burwell's original score and embracing a more conventional classical style, so when I heard that Burwell was coming back for the finale, I have to admit it didn't fill me with any great sense of anticipation. More fool me.The first thing you notice about Breaking Dawn Part I is how, for the most part, it's quite conventionally romantic. Carter Burwell is a composer whose usual approach to film is to underplay everything, to not wallow in emotion, to not telegraph the audience's reactions with his score, and he was clearly asked to do the exact opposite here by director Condon. As a result, the emotions come through quite clearly and vividly, and based on this music, I wish he did it more often.Throughout the score the familiar Burwell chord progressions, harmonies and key changes that have dominated the sound of his scores for 25 years are still very much in evidence, but whereas in a lot of his scores they tend to become the dominant feature of the music (as opposed to, say, themes or action sequences), and drown out the melodic elements in a sea of groaning bass, on Breaking Dawn Part I they actually play a subservient role to straightforward thematic writing, which from my point of view is a appreciated change of direction.Burwell uses pianos, gentle strings, lilting woodwinds, expressive acoustic guitars, and a much larger orchestral complement than usual to illustrate the developing relationship between the good-hearted vampire Edward Cullen and the object of his desires, Bella Swan, through a series of generally quite attractive cues. \"The Kingdom Where Nobody Dies\", \"Cold Feet\", the second half of \"What You See in the Mirror\", the pastoral \"Goodbyes\", the lovely \"The Threshold\", and the quintessentially Burwellian \"Honeymoon in Eclipse\" are all really quite delightful, and allow audiences to feel the love between the two protagonists in a real, tangible way. There have been hints of a more thematic side to Burwell in several of his earlier scores, notably things like Rob Roy, the finale of Conspiracy Theory, and parts of Fargo among others, but never has this aspect of Burwell's musical personality played such a large and consistent role throughout a score, and it's a welcome development.Standing at odds with these lovely tender pieces are a few moments of grunge-rock dissonance, such as in the opening part of \"What You See in the Mirror\", which leap out and remind the listener that Edward and Bella's romantic idyll is not all flower petals and silk sheets. These cues are direct descendents of the occasionally quite brutal tone of part of his first Twilight score, notably the sequences which dealt with Bella's once-typical life as a teenager in Washington state, and are replete with growling electric guitars, rock-inflected percussion writing, and a contemporary tone. \"A Nova Vida\" is a variation on this theme, taking the rock elements but giving them an almost Latin twist, allowing the guitars and drum kit to combine with a soft-voiced vocalist and gentle woodwinds and develop into a light, upbeat modern rock/romance piece.Elsewhere, there are some more tribal, almost Native American-inspired moments for ethnic flutes and percussion in cues such as \"Wolves on the Beach\", \"Pregnant\", \"Morte\", \"Don't Choose That\" and \"Playing Wolves\", which seem to act as a recurring leitmotif for the Quileute wolf pack to which Jacob belongs, and as a motif for the actions of Jacob himself. On several occasions these two styles come together, resulting in an interesting hybrid sound, most notably in the excellent \"A Wolf Stands Up\", one of Burwell's most majestic and powerful action cues, probably ever.Towards the end of the score, things become darker and more ominous, before emerging into some of the most passionate and emotional music I have ever heard Burwell write. \"It's Renesmee\" gradually builds into a pounding, ethnic action sequence, while \"The Venom\" introduces something I don't remember ever hearing in a Burwell score - the deep, brooding tones of a Gothic male voce choir. The sweeping lyricism in the first half of \"Biting\" is a wholly new sound for Burwell, as is the eardrum-crushing horror of the cue's second half, while Jacob's Native American motif reaches its powerful and melodramatically heroic zenith in \"You Kill Her, You Kill Me\". There's some astonishing brass and percussion writing going on down in the depths of this latter cue, and the finale is a wonderful example of major-key brass-led heroism such as we've never heard from him.Appropriately, the score concludes with a restatement of the recurring theme for Edward and Bella's relationship that Burwell wrote for the first film, \"Bella's Lullaby\". The theme doesn't feature that much in this score - there are brief reprises in \"Don't Choose That\", \"Hearing the Baby\", and later in \"Let's Start With Forever\", but that's pretty much it - but the film's finale, which is effectively the culmination of the courtship which began in the original movie, and results in a marriage, a child, and Bella's eventual transformation into a vampire, receives a more prominent musical acknowledgement here, which is very effective in context.While I find the Twilight movies themselves to be rather trite and predictable, and while I find the enduring popularity of the original novels to be completely mystifying, and while I didn't care so much for Burwell's initial music efforts on the first film, the franchise's sequel scores are fast becoming the most engaging parts of the entire series for me. I don't think it would be an overstatement to say that Breaking Dawn Part I has the potential to become one of my all-time favorite Carter Burwell scores, and it's mainly down to the increased sense of romance and lyricism that he brought to this project. He's said, again and again, in interviews down the years, that he hates the emotional manipulation that a lot of scores provide, but that's one of the main reasons I love film music so much - to feel that connection, that pull at the heartstrings. After all this time, and although he was effectively forced to do it by his director, Burwell has finally made that emotional connection with me.\n", "val": 0.0005566679174080491}
{"text": "Dear Music Appreciators,This is a distinctive and memorable soundtrack that will be most loved by fans of the movie who also enjoy instrumental music.An original score can be a great souvenir from a favorite movie that helps to relive the emotional roller-coaster of the story.  Because it is written to accompany the scenes in the movie, the music is loaded with storytelling power and while listening it can be fun to mentally replay scenes from the movie or to conjure up scenarios from one's own life that fit with the feel of the music.The touchstones are all here on this score (as they are for most popular Hollywood movies) and without even seeing the movie a listener can get a sense of the moments of romance, danger, drama, sadness, and joy that combine to tell the story.I spent a lot of time listening to movie soundtracks when I was younger and I remember that the instrumental scores often sounded best while lying in bed with the lights off trying to fall asleep.Happy Listening and Sweet Dreams,Sincerely,Constant Listener\n", "val": 0.028619538992643356}

My untrained ear detects maybe a few minor imperfections, but these imperfections are far overcome by the beautiful music lifted up in praise to God.  You see, fancy and perfect Christian music is ok, but I would prefer to here the voices of God's children who truly love Him lifting up their thankful voices to Him!  There is one particular track that I can't stop listening to.  \"When They Ring the Golden Bells\".  When I first heard it, I thought, I am not sure about the rendition of this song, but by the third time I was hooked.  Every time it plays, I hit the \"previous\" button to listen to it again another couple of times.  I truly have enjoyed this music this Christmas.  I have listened to the entire album many times.

{"text": "This album I find delightful despite three cuts that I had to delete. The renditions are for the most part very straightforward with good ensemble, soloists whose voices are easy to listen to, and with a country flavor including some steel guitar and a very satisfying bass guitar. Most of the cuts are performed without too much of the commercial pillowed synthetic-sounding string cushion that I prefer not to hear, and the backing chorus likewise isn't too commercial and stays in the background, very good balance. On a couple of numbers there are tasty rock touches.I didn't care for the first number which has piano with too much fakey styling and worse yet, a harmonica soloist who keeps swooping to the note from under the pitch, over and over. Plus there's something a little questionable about the tonality in that piece (when it modulates). Neither did I like the third one, a medley of Away in the Manger/Joy to the World/Hark the Herald Angels which was simply 'way overdone, bombastic; nor the eleventh, another bombastic rendition of Hark the Herald Angels Sing. Some of that is just personal taste. And I LOVED the rest, five stars.\n", "val": 0.004996445961296558}

It's just hard to give it the attention it deserves when it is sandwiched between songs by producer driven hitmakers like Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber. Sheeran's subtle vocals have a quiet strength to them and he uses a light touch over the melody allowing all of the parts of the song to shine.

No its not a happy song and It does hit pretty deep for me, as I have had friends that have succumb to drug abuse and are no longer with us.Overall I like the way this was recorded it sounds very natural like you are siting in a coffee house listening to the artist play his guitar while singing in front of you I really like the coffee house vibe the song creates.This reviewer is about sound. If you have seen some of my other reviews you will note I try and base my music reviews on sound quality not just my feelings about the song, as most concentrate on that only. For me if the sound quality is not top notch then the song for me is a mute point and can't be enjoyed at all.The overall sound quality is quite good only very slight clipping distortion toward the middle of the song noticeable on good monitors and a well trained ear, not to the average listener. Nice crisp well recorded transparent vocals, good tone to the main guitar, miked so that you hear the natural tones from the body of the guitar as he strums it. Nice clean mastering for the most part providing excellent presence. Can't say that for all MP3's I have purchased, but this one is a definite must purchase in my opin.One last note I purchased an Altec Lansing Orbit IMT228 portable speaker and this song sounds rather impressive even on that tiny speaker, suggesting that much care was taken when this song was recorded.

{"text": "Although I've always loved the Pet Shop Boys and have all their albums, I've never been enough of a fan to buy all the singles so I appreciate these B-sides compilations.Seventeen years on, 'Format' is the follow-up to the brilliant 'Alternative' and although of comparable quality is a very different collection. What I enjoyed most about 'Alternative' was seeing how Neil and Chris progressed musically. It was almost like hearing them become the Pet Shop Boys, so by the time of the last track on the second CD they have arrived at their unique sound.There's less development in 'Format' because that sound has been established. To that extent this new collection is less of a journey than a series of forays from an established point, so there are some real oddities, tracks that sound more experimental than anything you'd get on an album, for example 'Disco Potential' or 'The Former Enfant Terrible' (great title even if the song doesn't quite work). There are also some ridiculously camp songs too, 'Between Two Islands' and some unexpected instrumentals.This means the album is a bit patchy and I can see certain songs being permanently skipped over. What remains (and it is the majority) is just wonderful and cover the complete soundscape of the PSB. There are the thumping dance numbers, 'Resurrectionist' or 'Blue on Blue' as well the quieter, more thoughtful and intimate tracks (the closest PSB come to ballads) such as 'The Calm before the Storm' a short, elegiac gem. There are also some unexpectedly rocky numbers, 'I didn't get where I am today', for example, and I was glad to see 7\" versions of 'Discoteca' and 'No Time for Tears'.My only slight disappointment is a lack of true 'signature' PSB tracks, those songs that combine relentless disco beats with melancholic orchestral arrangements... but because this is a B-side collection (i.e. material that didn't make it on to the albums) that may not be a surprise.Finally no review could omit saying something about the packaging. As always with a PSB release it's as good as the music with a beautiful box, great cover design, two separate wallets for each CD and a fascinating booklet that adds more detail and explanation about the songs. (Shame there's no photo of 'The Boys'). Indeed so consistently good is PSB packaging I can never imagine buying one of their albums on digital download.Non-PSB fans probably won't be moved by this collection, but if you like them this is an essential purchase. It only goes up to 2009... so let's hope that means a third B-side collection will be released one day. I just hope we don't have to wait as long as we did after 'Alternative'.\n", "val": 0.005762032233178616}
{"text": "I love this stuff. Dance music that is so well done, so well sung, so well performed, that it leaves you in awe. I first heard Pet Shop Boys when they burst on the dance and pop scene back in the early 80s. Their Bobby O produced single \"West End Girls\" was an ear-opening experience. I was an instant fan. At the time I was also a big fan of \"alternative\" rock, but Pet Shop Boys were the ones to satisfy my inner disco soul. Their music was, and remains, a gulity pleasure for me. But of course they weren't just dance dudes, their music had --- and still has --- a very strong melodic pop sensibility to it. But I'm preaching to the choir here, I think. You all know how good their music is. And this 2-CD compilation is no exception. Admittedly, I have NOT been listening to each and every album PSB have released since I moved overseas in 1996. As another reviewer noted, the music they have done since then is practically that of a separate era. And yet ... their basic sound has not changed much during those long years. Their songs still sound vibrant and exuberant. The formula may remain the same, but don't go thinking PSB have become stagnant or that the songs on this compilation are inferior to their earlier tunes. With 38 songs on here, I assure you that there are some real gems to be found ... and heard. My personal faves are found on disc two; songs such as \"The Resurrectionist\" , \"Friendly Fire\", and \"Always\". But that's this week. I just got this collection last week and I'm certain that other tracks will endear themselves to me soon enough. Such is the beauty of Pet Shop Boys songs. Despite what some critics may say, there is depth and variety to their music. Music to dance to, songs to sing, melodies that linger. What more do you need?\n", "val": 0.013795222155749798}
{"text": "This collection of b-sides from the past 15 years allows us to reacquaint ourselves with rare gems. Rare in the sense that fans may already have many (if not most of them) in cd singles, and so do not get to listen to them that often after their release. CD singles after all have a rather shorter lifespan than full albums. So this collection, just like Alternative did few years back allows us to revisit this body of work, and boy (pun intended) is this great!In comparison to Alternative though, which showcased the Boys during the commercial peak, I believe that this collection is much more valuable because it showcases a stunning collection of songs from their less commercial period. So, it allows us to revisit songs that were probably less heard than their Alternative counterparts, and the fact that they are all outstanding speaks volumes.CD 2 is probably the better of the two, signaling the Boys' return to their standard electronic sound (after the experiment that was Release). Songs like Blue on Blue, Transparent, Gin an Jag, Up and Down, Always, could all have been a-sides on their own right. And of course the rather well-known by now We're the Pet Shop Boys is simply stunning. The only thing left out is the material from the Christmas CD EP, which would have been a nice bonus for the people who do not already have it.With the outstanding early release of the song Invisible from their forthcoming Fall 2012 album the Boys show that they continue riding the wave of artistic (and to a certain extent commercial too) rejuvenation that was ushered in by Yes. Thanks for the music!\n", "val": 0.014764714054763317}
{"text": "PSB's second B-side compilation is very good, obviously, though not quite as good as Alternative.  The biggest difference to me is that the element of discovery is absent here.  When I bought Alternative in 1995, nearly every track was new for me.  Those B-sides would have been very difficult to find in the pre-commercial internet age, especially in the United States.  You would have spent an enormous amount of time and money ordering import singles.  So Alternative was just a godsend for PSB fanatics; we were offered two whole discs of songs that many people probably didn't know existed.But Format covers a different era.  I think most PSB fans will already know many if not most of the tracks here.  There were only a few that I hadn't heard.  With Bilingual in 1996, PSB started a policy of two-disc releases for all new albums that included associated B-sides and remixes on the second disc.  Those versions were limited-run, but they were widely available in the US.  Certainly not every track on Format was available on a double-CD release, but many were.  On the other hand, it's great to have all these tracks in one collection.Anyway, the music here is mostly great.  PSB were quick to point out on Alternative that not every track was good; there were some truly bad songs there, as there are here.  But the good-to-bad ratio is high and approximately equal to that album.  And like Alternative, the great thing about these tracks is that PSB experimented and stretched out.  The best tracks here come from the later years.  My favourites in no order:- How I Learned to Hate Rock & Roll- The Boy Who Couldn't Keep His Clothes On- The View From Your Balcony (one of their all-time best B-sides)- Silver Age- Always (a truly great track; seems to be one of NT's favourites too)- Nightlife (great outtake from that album)- Between Two Islands- We're the Pet Shop Boys (ironically a cover)- Transparent (energetic tech-house)- The Resurrectionist- Girls Don't Cry- Gin and Jag (PSB's ode to aging. Favourite line: \"Be careful with the decanter, dear.  Do you know how much it's worth?\")- After the Event (the lyrics are so great and so PSB)- Up and DownUltimately, PSB fans are quite blessed.  PSB are just a machine that cranks out an endless supply of great new pop songs.  There's a lot of music to work through here, and it really allows the listener a good idea the breadth and quality of music that PSB are capable of.\n", "val": 0.009928179904818535}
{"text": "Format picks up where the previous B sides compilation Alternative left off. Starting with 1996's Bilingual and closing after 2009's Yes, Format again showcases the wealth and depth of material not included in official albums.If you are looking for variety, you'll be greatly rewarded for buying this:Signature Pet Shop Boys dance tracks like Delusions Of Grandeur and Sexy Northerner.Garage disco includes Disco Potential and The Truck Driver And His Mate performed in the Somewhere Pet Shop Boys In Concert DVD.Girls Don't Cry. A witty reply to The Cure's Boys Don't Cry.Betrayed, a Bossa Novish piece mixed with a little trance.I Didn't Get Where I Am Today. A sunny cheery drive away song.Confidential, originally intended for Tina Turner, is an easy listening piece that grows on you.Hit And Miss is a melancholic mid tempo ditty with an uncharacteristic guitar. The result is fantastic.In Private, originally sung with Dusty Springfield in the 80s, turned into a soaring Elton John collaboration.The Calm Before The Storm. A little gem that will fit very well as a theatre piece.Beautiful ballads such as Friendly Fire and Between Two Islands really got to me.One thing to note. On disc one, tracks one to 12 (minus Confidential) can be found on Bilingual Further Listening.If you are into design, don't download this. Format comes beautifully packaged in a box set with separate envelopes for the discs and a booklet featuring the Boys' commentary on all tracks.The above are just some worthy mentions. Format contains a total of 38 songs, making this a must have item for fans. As for me, I'm completely enamoured!\n", "val": 0.022583629935979843}
{"text": "After nearly 25 years of releasing singles and cds, the PET SHOP BOYS are proving once again that they are only getting better as time passes. Listening to FORMAT, I am struck by the number of excellent songs that are as good if not better to some of the tracks that they have released as singles. For example the duet with Elton John \"In Private\" works really well as an upbeat pop number and \"Blue on Blue\" is classic Euro Hi-NRG.Another hidden gem is \"We're the Pet Shop Boys\" which is their cover of a song first released by My Robot Friend and then most recently by Robbie Williams. What group do you know of, has done a cover of a song that pokes fun or is about themselves done by someone else? You will love this song with all the references to PSB classic hits...Do not be distracted by the fact that some of these tracks were originally made several years back. For example, \"The Boy Who Couldn't Keep His Clothes On\" (produced in 1997) could have been played at this year's WORLD MUSIC CONFERENCE in Miami and would have received great praise. It helps of course, that it was produced by Danny Tenaglia and has a great 4/4 House beat.Die hard fans like myself might not enjoy every single song but with a choice of 38 tracks, there is tons of material to savour.For me, cd 2 is much stronger. Overall, here you get all the songs that previously were only available as expensive import only cd or dvd or in the case of \"We're all criminals now\" digital download (Hence the title of the cd - FORMAT) only for the cost of a regular double cd. Well worth it!I only wished other bands put out such b-side or alternative compilations. But then, how many artists have the creativity, genius and longetivity of the Pet Shop Boys!\n", "val": 0.02171582356095314}

{"text": "As a fan of the Pet Shop Boys since West End Girls, they have always been ahead of the music scene. They started releasing albums of B-sides because they had so much music that people never heard. It also put it all together as opposed to trying to hunt down rareities and limited editions that they are know for. Format is their latest collection of great music that sounds pretty damn good. Some songs you may recognize, and the rest you'll just dance to. It took me a while to find this CD and it is worth it.\n", "val": 0.058650944381952286}

Secondly, even for the Pet Heads who buy all the singles, Format is great because the B-sides are organized in somewhat chronological order and flow nicely for listening.As far as the music itself, where PSB is concerned, either you like them or you hate them.  PSB fans will not be won or lost over this CD set.  This set is highly unique not filled with remixes or songs that are slight variations on those previously released.These B-sides are more experimental and less commercial than primary CD tracks, and some of the songs on here sound a tad unpolished or have lyrics dealing with unusual topics.  Of course this is one reason to love the PSB!!

{"text": "I love this collection of B-sides. Gotta love the album tracks and singles but as Chris and Neil have said the B-sides can cut a bit deeper into things and really are a deeper connection with the fans. The songs can reveal much more because they're not really about appealing to a commercial sense and audience as much. Being commercially appealing with things isn't bad or wrong but it's wonderful to show that you have deeper ideals as well, as PSB does in these tracks. Be it on personal thoughts, feelings, situations, and general happenings. B-sides can be so much more experimental too and they do try their hand at different things while at the same time not being so self indulgent that they release substandard material. They're very self aware and know where good and bad lie. So it's a very wonderful compilation of B-sides that show a deeper and wider side. The question for some fans would be B before A? I would say you could implement some of both and have the greatest and perfect album ever made.\n", "val": 0.048193540424108505}

I already had How I Learned to Hate Rock & Roll, Delusions of Grandeur, and The View from Your Balcony.  The new tracks I liked were We're the Pet Shop Boys and Blue On Blue.  The other tracks are not very catchy & my attention wasn't kept long enough for me to judge the lyrics.

Eventually I got enough \"bonus\" tracks to fill two complete CDs.  Well if you missed the boat and didn't buy the singles back in the day, now is your chance to get these really cool and fun Pet Shop Boys into your music library.  I have often found that some of the \"bonus\" songs were better than the some of the album tracks.  If you are a fan of the Bilinqual Album I'm sure you will enjoy the jauntier and much improved \"Discotecca\" track--in my opinion this is the version that should have been on the original CD.  This is a must for any Pet Shop Boys fan.  It includes some songs from some singles I was not able to buy because of the expense, making this a great bargain.

{"text": "This is the second B-side song collection of the Pet Shop Boys, the first one being Alternative about 17 years back. This one spans from Bilingual to Yes. Surprisingly, there are more B-sides to Format than Alternative, at 38 versus 30. Of course, these songs take up nearly all 79 mins and 59 secs of each disc, so there was hardly any room for any more songs.The truly good thing about this album, specifically living in the US, is it makes these songs very available. A number of these songs were incredibly difficult to obtain, and just a handful were somewhat \"easy\". Bilingual's B-sides are the most readily available, as they released Bilingual/Further Listening, which contains all it's B-sides on it's Further Listening bonus disc. The B-sides of Nightlife and Release were sporadically used on bonus discs in the US, but not all B-Sides were used on those discs. For PopArt and Fundamental, there was hardly any way to get ahold of them except through incredibly expensive imports. Yes is the only exception, as it's B-Sides were made readily available as digital downloads, even in the US. With Format, even as an import, it's still the best way to get all these songs, and make them all readily available.Many of these as-of-yet rare gems are truly some of the best songs the Boys have ever made in their career. Brilliant music with the catchiest melodies that far transcends anything commercially available today. From a song sung by Chris Lowe (Lies, a rare treat indeed not only that he's the main vocal but he's actually singing without any modifications to his voice or speak-singing), to many of the others, it's hard to imagine how the genius behind these songs works. All we can be is glad that the genius of Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant is not only still alive and kicking, but far more brilliant, zealous, and energetic than ever before, if that were ever possible!I hold PSB, Tennant and Lowe, as arguably the most brilliant songwriters ever, for nearly every song they create together is a masterpiece, steady, or even increasing, in quality from before 1986 to 2012 and beyond. In their entire canon, there are a couple of songs that tempt the mundane, or even earn some level of contempt, but these are far too few and far between to be a permanent blemish on their canon as a whole. The true genius of their artistry is found nowhere better than this, their collection of B-Sides where they are uninhibited in their songwriting skills. Even those with a mere passive interest in the Pet Shop Boys will surely find something on Format that is aurally pleasing. Put simply, this is an amazing compilation of pure perfection.\n", "val": 0.024976639077067375}

I've been to several of their concerts and I sincerely think of them as old friends. I expected this album anxiously on my mailbox for almost a month and when I finally got it I put the first CD on my player, I was slightly bored at first, and thought \"Well, these tracks are old, they are from the nineties, it's OK for them to sound dated\". Then I skipped some tracks and kept listening, but after a while I wasn't just bored: I felt irritated by some of the tracks. I had to turn the volume down.I make electronic music myself, and the lack of work in the tracks shows. Where are the magnificent orchestral arrangements? Where are those spine-tingling chord changes? Where are the clever lyrics?The next day I put CD2 on my car on my way to job. There were some good tracks, but I already got them in my other albums. The rest quickly became background noise. When the album finished, it wasn't with a bang, but with a slight sizzle. It felt like warm beer, not like the champagne I was used to.I can say that Neil's voice is as awesome as always. But that's all. I gave it three stars because they are Neil and Chris, and there's no way in hell I'd give them two stars.

For another buck and change, add her duet with Tony Bennett (also featured in the special).As for the EP, it was lifted straight from Gaga's terrific, insightful, funny and weepy holiday special. This music is essential Gaga for the Little Monsters, and it will likely win her a legion of new fans as well. Just as she showed with her showstopping Gaga medley on SNL a few years back, plant the girl at a piano and she will bring the house down. No dancers, costumes, vocal effects or light show needed.WHITE CHRISTMAS - Gaga makes it her own - and even adds new lyrics.ORANGE COLORED SKY - This song entered the setlist of the Monster Ball late in the tour and finally gets the spotlight it deserves - spectacular.YOU & I; EDGE OF GLORY - The highlights of the EP, Gaga sings with such passion, she lifts the songs to unbelievable new heights. Where her new Remix EP deconstructs her songs, these two reworkings put the artist and her pure art front and center - can a grown man swoon? Wow.Thankfully - they leave in her stories and banter between the songs, giving the EP a cohesive, VH1 Storytellers type vibe.As for the rest of the \"live\" audio tracks from the special (Born This Way, Bad Romance, etc.), I am pretty sure the sound was lifted from the Madison Square Garden DVD - the songs sounded way too big for the room the holiday special was taped in.

I can honestly say that this is the longest I've gone in 10 years without taking any prescription pain medicine, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, melatonin or even Advil PM.I've long thought that working on the computer did something to my brain waves.  I work late at night because I don't get interrupted with phone calls.  But it always took at least 3 hours after I quit working on the computer before I could go to sleep.  It was frustrating to have to spend 12 hours trying to get 6 to 8 hours sleep.But since the first night I started using this album I have been able to go to sleep within an hour after I stopped working.  In checking the number of plays on my Ipod it invariably shows that I go through two full cycles on the album and wake up naturally at the start of the third cycle.  Amazing.I have asthma, severe arthritus (two knee replacements already), fibromyalgia, diabetes and the underlying cause for most of these, central sleep apnea.  To be able to go this long without pain medication is a miracle.  But the better I sleep, the less pain I am in.

I met Mario personally and he entertained us royally since we came so far,actually from California. From then on we became friends and he is very unique.Who meets and greets every fan after the concerts ans stays for hours to make sure he speaks and gives a hug to all.To get back to \"Beautiful Things\" the name of his first song. He sung this song and danced with a little girl at the opening of the Special Olympics in Greece. It was a lovely  scene. The song is delightful. The songs The Face,IBelieve in You,Time for Me and Kiss on the Wind will add strong feelings listening together with your loved oneThe duets are fantastic especially Maria with the talented Vittorio Grigolo. I was awed at the blending of their voices and had to listen to it several times. and so will you. You will also adore Alkistis Protopsalti in the Spanish song Rojo VioioentoShe is a frolicking special star. Together they had a whole concert this past summer.in Greece,all in Greek. Vanessa Williams and Mario sing a duet which is very great.Am I biased in favor of Mario Frangoulis? You bet I am. I would be happier if he could entertain us more frequently in America.

{"text": "Great choices of songs... compared to what he usually does, this has a surprising amount of English on it. You could band all of the songs into the \"inspirational songs\" category if you wanted, but that would be over-simplifying things. This \"international\" album doesn't have Greek on it like his other two did; however it lets us hear him in French on the last song, so that make up for it, and brings the language count to 4 different languages in total.Vanessa Williams makes a surprise appearance on this album... her voice compliments his well - two mature artists with a specific type of audience. His two Italian songs are probably quite weak when you compare them to his other Italian songs from his other albums; they lack punch and both sound quite alike. The Spanish song 'Rojo Violento' is the album's bright spot - it really brings the tempo up, and challenges Mario in ways that we haven't heard before - he's practically singing a salsa, or possibly a paso-doble. 'Strong' sounds like an ode to fallen heroes (soldiers) so it is nice to hear for that reason.My personal favourite here are 'Beautiful Things,' 'Time For Me,' 'Kiss On The Wind,' and the duet with Vittorio Grigolo, 'Maria.'\n", "val": 0.006106913089752197}

There aren't many songs that have that affect on me, that touch me that way.The Face is not far behind in my favorite song list. It's just wonderful. Other favorites include I Believe in You, Beautiful Things, and Rojo Violento. Rojo Violento is a fabulous duet with Alkisti Protopsalti. Alkisti is a powerful, fiesty singer, and she is part of what makes this song so enjoyable. I love the parts where one of them is singing, and then the other one echoes with \"Ahhh\" in the background. This song always puts me in a good mood and makes me feel like dancing.In Beautiful Things, you can feel that Mario really seems to believe what he's singing, and makes me believe it too.

{"text": "After listening to their debut album (The Last Sunset) I was instantly intrigued by their lyrical creativity, crazy breakdowns, and powerful vocals. While The Last Sunset was also self-produced, as was this album, it lacked the superior production quality evident in Mirrors, therefore its drops were hardly heard and there was practically no bass in their sound at all. Nonetheless, I still got hooked on their songs My Heart In Your Hands and Read My Lips from The Last Sunset - enough so that I HAD to check out this album.Pros: both creative and straightforward lyrics, brutal breakdowns without being monotonous or hackneyed, insane bass drops placed strategically throughout each song, impressive sound quality (especially considering self-production), clean vocals sound great and unsynthesized, screams are varied and performed awesomely (I've seen them live, the vocalist is very impressive), flow from track-to-track was done nicelyCons: I would've preferred a little more clean vox, or maybe 1 or 2 slow songs with predominantly cleans, as clearly the band has the capability; many of the songs have a similar background sound to them, so much so that at first or second listen you might be confused as to what's what; laughably bland album cover and irrelevant album title (unlike The Last Sunset by far); I was duped when I bought it from here because the CD case was cracked and the insert was ridiculously plain (track listing, band title and album title in all the same font, no additional graphics or credits, acknowledgements, or lyrics), but it's the only outlet I could find.As you can see, the cons are pretty trivial.This being the band's second album and truly their first with this impressive sound quality/production 'value', we can only expect amazing greatness in the near future (they're soon to release a new album this summer, as is). I look forward to it, too, with as much energy as they give me with each song and to know that I'm not alone. For a European band their vocalist's English is great and coherent, even when screaming (well, sometimes), and their fan base is massive both overseas and American.***Prologue - dubstep fade-in to heavy instrumental for great intro, just wished it lasted longer (8/10)Story of a Stranger - the song that hooked me for this album, generally awesome on all aspects (10/10)When Silence Breaks - solid song, love the all-powerful bass drop at its 'interlude' (8/10)Infest - great song with some well-performed cleans here and there, a rare solo, and the greatest drum-hook I've ever heard(7.5/10)The Storm - melodic intro leads into one of the album's fastest-paced songs (6.5/10)The Chosen Ones - took me some time to let this one sink into me, it's one of the heaviest tracks on the album (7/10)Lights Out - decent song with a brutal bridge and a surprise-dubstep breakdown that actually complements the song (7/10)December - emotionally powerful song with some clean vox that work really well, another rare solo, and intense screams; fades into melodic riff that flows into next song perfectly (9/10)Mary - short-lived melodic instrumental that is both beautiful and sad, shows that these guys DO have a heart, and some versatility to be built upon for future albums (8/10)Deadline - amazing song with great clean vox and powerful screams for a generally irate song (9/10)One Bullet Left - probably their heaviest song on the album, but aside from a slightly catchy chorus it doesn't do much for me (5.5/10)Jnana - halfway through this melodic instrumental come slow heavy riffs and faster-paced melodies that retain its beautiful sound until it builds up to lead into next song perfectly (9/10)We Are the Wall - introduced perfectly after an interlude from previous song, this one is heavy and catchy to boot, with a comical touch on the bridge (7/10)Paralyzed - memorably brutal opening, but aside from that it's not all that impressive; features a 2-minute slow melodic outro to end the album (6/10)***in short...GET THIS ALBUM, IN WHATEVER FORM YOU LIKE!!support this incredible band, they have a promising future\n", "val": 0.0002047792513621971}

Does this hinder the album in any way? ABSOLUTELY NOT.Breakdown of Sanity has found that through intelligent writing they can integrate the most hated thing in all of metal (breakdowns) into a manically paced song without it feeling as though the entire song was structured around it. Very rarely will you hear a slow, plodding build-up to a breakdown that you saw a mile away. Groovy, brutal, catchy, relentless, unique....these are all words that can describe each song on the album. Each song sounds like part of the flow, but they don't seem to get lost in the mix. Each song has a distinct sound that won't soon be forgotten.The only downside of this album? It ends.But in all seriousness, this is Metalcore done the RIGHT way. Don't be turned away by the \"core\" tag, the breakdowns, or anything else. This album DESERVES to be played over, and over, and over again for years to come.

Now, I've seen many Broadway musicals and realize that, for some of them, the music stands up well by itself (e.g., the classic Sound of Music and West Side Story, the more recent Book of Mormon and Kinky Boots).  For other productions, the music is best when heard in the context of the actual show.  I haven't seen Matilda yet, but maybe I will appreciate the music once I've seen the show.

This old Broadway fanatic is in tears of gratitude for the brilliantly clever and musically sensitive Tim Minchin, who has given us a score with heart, wit, originality and the necessary touch of poison to honor Roald Dahl's comically sinister undercurrents. Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, the diction is impeccable on most tracks (I admit \"Revolting Children\" would have benefited from better enunciation). The orchestrations are delightful, performances full throttle (Bertie Carvel is a revelation as Miss Trunchbull), and the recording manages to capture the energy and genius of the live show.

This is also true  on \"Secret Agent\", and \"Walls Have Eyes\".  This LP  contains some of the best emotional strains I have ever listened to from  Robin...\"In and Out of Love\"...listen to the song as it trails  off...just before the next emotional tear jerk song \"Kathy's  Gone\".

There was alot of  Brit-synth around at the time (Duran Duran, Tears For Fears, etc.)and Robin  would have done better to not try to follow that path.But alas, in mine  eyes, Robin can do no wrong, so I shall have to rate this a 3 of 5.\n", "val": 6.487870996352285e-05}

{"text": "Imo it is the best of the Robin solo albums. Made in 1982, then released in 83, this was Robin's second solo effort. The first, Robin's Reign, came when the brothers split in 1969. In 82, Robin was in a new relationship, a new father, and he was making this album while on good terms with his brothers. All the songs on HOAY (I love sounding that out!) are composed by Robin and Maurice, and you can even hear Maurice backing on some of the songs.Robin was clearly happy at this time, or at least happier than he was while making Robin's Reign. This jubilance is evident in the first song, Juliet. It is a very happy go lucky bubbly song one would never expect from Robin Gibb. He sounds different, and sings quite high through the song and album. Sometimes you can't understand what he's saying.  The album is very 80s sounding, but that doesn't make it less enjoyable today. In fact, Juliet will really get stuck in your head. Next is the title song How Old Are You. This is one of the ones it seems you can also hear Maurice. It continues the upbeat style of Juliet. Actually there is no slow song on the album, or any of Robin's 80s solo albums for that matter! The lyrics on the album are superb. Each song has a hook that will stuck in your head. The arrangements are also interesting. It is mosty just Robin in dubs and overdubs, with Maurice backing on some. However, Robin variates his voice within the songs and it sounds like three or four people at times. Very effective.In and Out of Love is slower than the first two songs, but still very smooth. It has a bit more of an 80s sound to it, but I like the lyrics, and its one of the few where you can understand what Robin is saying. Even my mother likes this one. She kept asking me who it was, since she refused to believe it was Mr. Quiver Robin. Its interesting that before the 80s solo work, Robin always sang the really sad or sappy Bee Gees songs, but when the group comes together again for ESP, Robin is different. Stronger, more confident in himself and his voice.Danger is somewhat unique sounding in comparision with the rest of the album. The music is different, and Robin sings in a different voice. It's a nice break from the higher singing. He Can't Love You continues the `hook will get stuck in your head' trend. This is the one song that perhaps sounds like the Robin people were expecting, probably because it is the one that sounds like a Bee Gees song. Great story song with a perfectly arranged chorus.\n", "val": 0.02985590696334839}
{"text": "So you love 80s music? But think you've heard it all before? If you have not heard Robin Gibb, you have heard nothing! !If you read BG fans' reviews (and YES I am one of them) you could deduce that HOW OLD ARE YOU (HOAY) is the post flower power incarnation of an eccentric voiced hippy. Well... ignore comparitive reviews; They do not lead to any insight into Robin Gibb music. This album has NOTHING to do with BeeGees actually. It is an album that pinpoints the era of the beginning of pop's globalisation, and forcing MJ's Thriller off the top of the charts in Germany in 1983 it proved to be a relevant 80s European New Romantics Masterpiece.As Europe was swept by eurobeat post-disco campness, Robin tapped into this vibrance mixing with the Dark Goth sounds of London's upcoming BATCAVE club of the mid-1980s; The place that ensured that the Eighties was destined for historical significance. Robin elegantly tapped into the darker side of this slick New Wave movement, ensuring that Robin would far outlive the 80s even if the BeeGees disco backlash would spell the end of the group.Luckily that didn't happen, yet Robin's angelic voice and Celtic folk overtones in their own right did prove to live long past that decade that haunts us in the 2000s.No-one should be surprised that Robin is releasing a new album this year, that almost certainly won't be his last (especially judging by Germany's responses to his solo appearances of the last 2 deacades).Robin was always the fashion conscious BG. Hell, he even sung with Marcella Detroit before she was known to be a Shakespeare Sister! ROB YOU ARE THE MAN!LOL. Furthermore, Robin pushed the boundaries of BG music, as is evident on the ESP & SIZE albums. Robin's extra sensory perception of pop music trends will no doubt enrich his upcoming album, which promises a fresh dose of variety, and unfamiliar territory. Barry has forgotten about new sounds since his Now Voyager project of 1984. Barry is cool yet Robin made the supergroup into what they should have been, even if most of us are oblivious to that side of BeeGees. Check out HOAY before you make an opinion about Music from the 1980s! HOAY rules!!\n", "val": 0.006524528842419386}

This current album released in 1983 contains help from the Bee Gees old band members (Alan Kendall and Dennis Bryon) and twin brother Maurice.  It did well in Europe and drowned in the then, anti-Bee Gees USA.The first song, \"Juliet\" (which went to #1 in Europe) is a thumper, falsetto-riddled uptempto masterpiece still used in their concerts.  \"How Old Are You\", \"In And Out Of Love\", \"Kathy's Gone\" and \"Another Lonely Night In New York\" (another hit) are nearly as good.  From then on, it goes downhill.The drum beats become monotonous, the lyrics banal and Robin's high-shrilled attempts at reaching the highest falsetto notes imaginable are mind-numbing.  \"Don't Stop The Night\" and \"I Believe In Miracles\" will send you running to the medicine cabinet for pain relievers!Considering that half of the songs are very good is enough reason to purchase this CD.

Her last proper full length album was 2003's excellent \"Moodring.\" Before that, she was known for the smash hits \"My Case of the Ex\" and \"Lady Marmalade.\"Mya has been actively recording albums in Japan during the last few years. 2007's \"Liberation\" was perhaps her best album to date, and it was followed up by 2008's \"Sugar & Spice.\" She released a mixtape, \"Beauty and the Streets\" last year, so  that makes K.I.S.S. her first proper album release stateside in nearly a decade.The album showcases Mya's sassy side (as in \"Earthquake\" and \"Somebody Come Get This B****\") as well as her sensual side (\"Love Me Some Him\"). But the best thing about this album are the pop songs. \"Fabulous Life\" is every bit as fun and catchy as Katy Perry's \"California Gurls,\" and \"Mess Up My Hair\" is a thumping, melodic pop masterpiece. Sadly, she left off the breathtaking ballad \"Running Back,\" which featured Iyaz, and was included on the Japanese version of K.I.S.S. If you are a diehard fan, purchase that song for download as well, you'll be glad you did.Mya should be a superstar. It is a crime that these songs can't seem to catch fire on the charts, because Mya is one of the most underrated singers out there today. She has paid her dues and this deserves to be a hit.

{"text": "\"Heavy As a Feather\" is the second release by pianist/composer Kathryn Kaye, quickly following her very impressive debut, \"Dreaming Still.\" Produced by Will Ackerman at Imaginary Road Studios, recorded by Tom Eaton, and mastered by Corin Nelsen, the eleven original tracks include four piano solos and seven ensemble pieces from duets to larger groups. The music reflects a variety of influences that includes folksongs and hymns from childhood, ten years of classical music training, an international performing career, and the beauty of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado where Kaye makes her home. Supporting musicians include Ackerman (guitar), Charlie Bisharat (violin), Eugene Friesen (cello), Jill Haley (English horn), Tony Levin (bass), Michael Manring (fretless bass), and Ramesh (percussion). The piano is always front and center, but Kaye graciously gives the other musicians plenty of room to shine. The uncluttered melodies are played with such heartfelt expression that each becomes a distinctive gem as well as part of a flowing, cohesive whole.\"Heavy As a Feather\" begins with the lovely \"Mountain Laurel,\" a piano solo bathed in spring breezes and dappled sunshine. \"Meadow Morning\" is a quintet for cello, English horn, piano, percussion,and bass. Peaceful contentment flows from each note, painting a picture in beautiful greens and pastel tones. \"An Empty Street in Prague\" is worth the price of the CD all by itself. It begins as a mournful piano solo - simple yet deeply emotional. When Charlie Bisharat enters with his violin a little past the halfway point, the music becomes tragic and heart-breaking. I really love this track! \"So Much Sky\" is a gorgeous piano solo - spare, graceful, and evocative. \"Summer Afternoon\" begins as a languid piano solo, but when Haley adds the voice of the English horn, it really becomes relaxed and downright lazy - delicious! \"How Deep, How Simple\" brings back Ackerman, Bisharat, Eaton, and Friesen for an easy-going tribute to the profound beauty of simplicity. \"Dusk at Rockhouse Creek\" is a quiet piano solo that tells of the stillness of the coming night as the day recedes from the sky. Very open and spacious, you can almost see stars starting to twinkle as the sky darkens. The title track is a duet for cello and piano with gentle strains that seem to float on the air - hence the title, I'm sure. It's amazing how much an artist can convey with so few notes. \"One Last Quiet Breath,\" a solemn but very relaxed piano solo, ends the album with a peaceful kind of grace that will have you coming back for more!\"Heavy As a Feather\" proves beyond a doubt that Kathryn Kaye will not be joining the long list of one-hit wonders! This is a great album, and I recommend it!\n", "val": 0.03478997200727463}

{"text": "Out of print for many years, this album came from the split of the Bee Gees in 1969. Despite poor album sales the single `Saved By The Bell' went to #2 on the UK pop charts. It's an interesting and sometimes perplexing array of songs. Robin Gibb once mentioned that he felt the album was unfinished and that is noted. Pop historians have regarded this as a unique dive into baroque pop of its own kind. Although `One Million Years' and `August October' were also released as singles, the album is a hodgepodge of creativity. `Lord Bless All' is an overly overdubbed chorus, `Farmer Ferdinand Hudson' is a garbled mix of unintelligible lyrics and `The Worst Girl In This Town' is simply bewildering. However, some songs are simply pop gems like, `Give Me A Smile' and `Most Of My Life' with the classic Bee Gees orchestration for mood and backup. The use of horns is nicely done. There was to be another solo album called, \"Sing Slowly Sisters\" to follow, but the reunion of the Bee Gees placed that on the \"lost albums\" list. If you like Robin and his warbling voice, you'll enjoy this album. But don't forget that it was he who said he felt it was unfinished. Regardless, it is a piece of pop history.\n", "val": 0.002936732489615679}

Good enough for Jeff Beck, Mark Knopfler, Chet Atkins, Andres Segovia, etc - good enough for me!  But then every so often, a recording session or a performance calls specifically for the use of a pick.  Instead of the usual few days of steady at it to get my picking chops where they need to be, I use the Stylus Pick.  15 minutes usually does the job.  It's a Zen thing: Form and Motion.  It puts everything right where it needs to be without having to think about it.  The results are truly amazing.  It saves so much time, I wish I had it when I was a kid.

{"text": "On The Killers' epic sophomore disc Flowers and Co. have jettisoned the New Wave stomp of \"Hot Fuss\" and replaced it with expansive hook-filled nostalgia. The album opens powerfully (much like the adrenaline kick of \"Fuss\" opener \"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\"), the signature propulsive drums and keyboards raising the curtains and unveiling cinematic vignettes of Midwestern Americana. \"I've never really known anybody to die before,\" Flowers croons, painting a vivid picture of a grandmother's wake.The title track is followed by \"Enterlude,\" a short thematic primer whose melody is later reprised in the excellent album closer \"Exitlude.\" \"We hope you enjoy your stay, it's good to have you with us, even if it's just for the day,\" Flowers sings, as if the listener is a drifter passing through an old western town. This being a concept album (supposedly), it makes sense to frame the songs in the context of a brief excursion into \"Sam's Town.\" In fact, the album works best when viewed in this way. As demonstrated on \"Hot Fuss\" the Killers are good at inhabiting a musical niche. \"Fuss\" itself was a concept album of sorts, the '04 Killers were a bunch of eyeliner wearing, androgynous disco-dwellers with an affinity for synthesizers. The new Killers have taken a fancy to the mythic American West, and instead of cribbing from Bowie they've grown scruffy beards and are now taking lessons from Springsteen. He is, after all, the Boss.In addition to the title track and single \"When You Were Young,\" highlights include the bouncy \"For Reason's Unknown,\" the earnest \"Read My Mind,\" and the Queen inspired \"Why Do I Keep Counting?\"Only time will tell if \"Sam's Town\" will be the mass success that it's predecessor was. I for one am relieved this disc is as good as it is. After hearing \"Hot Fuss\" for the first time, The Killers were one of my favorite bands. It's good to report that after hearing \"Sam's Town\" they will remain that way.\n", "val": 0.023937920108437538}

All of which seems to be a very bad idea but The Killers are so oblivious to what a bad idea that is and, therefore, they pull it off magnificently.

{"text": "When an artist or group has a mega selling debut album, most record companies prefer groups to follow up that mega hit first album with more of the same type of music on the artist's second release.But instead of releasing an album of songs that sound like a continuation of HOT FUSS, the Killers show off their versatility & that they are not afraid to take chances by releasing songs sounding distinctly differant from their first album.The rock driven first single WHEN WE WERE YOUNG might be the 3rd or 4th best song on the album which is filled with more rock oriented music than the first album.The one constant on SAMS TOWN is that even the rock oriented songs are songs that could very easily be remixed for the clubs and become dance favorites.If you are looking for a MR. BRIGHTSIDE part two, READ MY MIND is probably the most potential radio friendly single of the album. The song's catchy chorus, layered keyboards, & hard driven beat make this song a sure fire potential hit.BONES is another catchy up beat 80ish sounding new wave type song that would sound as good at the clubs while dancing on the dance floor, as it would sound on a rock radio station.Other stand out songs & potential singles include the title track- SAMS TOWN, FOR REASONS UNKOWN & THE RIVER IS WILD.Buy SAMS TOWN.

{"text": "There are many negative reviews of this album and I'm quite sure it's because some people like their melodies easy, catchy and bordering on Indie and bubblegum crap. I loved Hot Fuss and when I listened to this album the first time it really turned me off. A day later, I listened to it and the songs felt different to me. A few hours later, I hit \"Sam's Town,\" \"When You Were Young,\" \"Bones\" and \"This River is Wild\" and wondered why I disliked the album.This is completely and utterly NOT Hot Fuss Redux. This is a different album built on a similar philosophy of song writing, but the band seems less interested in being pigeon-holed and more interested in being varied. If you liked Mr. Brightside, Somebody Told Me and Midnight Show but thought the rest of Hot Fuss was sub-par, you won't like this disc much, I don't think. It's got a lot stronger instrumentation, pounding basslines and overall great production value.And for anyone who complains about any band, anywhere being \"all in the studio,\" grow up, would you please? That's not a critique of an album, that's a complaint that should be lodged against the entire music industry. The Killers pride themselves on a new take of using synthesizors, of course they rely on a studio heavily. Listen to the VH1 acoustic sessions or the Live at the Wireless bootleg and you will hear the merit of the Killers' musical capacity. That's like complaining that someone's voice doesn't sound like it's got a vibraphone in person, and here's the reason why: it's a studio invention.The Killers, contrary to what most would like to think about modern music, do have the ability to write well. All of the songs, save perhaps Uncle Johnny which is vaguely boring, have strong writing. The strongest among all the bands in the world? I wouldn't know, I've certainly not listened to all the music in the world. But it's very solid, backed up by a band that knows how to play and play well.This is a very solid album and the term \"Sophomore Slump\" shouldn't be used in the same sentence with it.\n", "val": 0.012072693556547165}
{"text": "This second album finds the Killers departing the sound that made them famous on Hot Fuss and developing a \"concept\" album that is anything but typical.  The lead singer Brandon Flowers told MTV that this would be \"the best album in the past 20 years\".  Well...I don't know about that but it definitely is the freshest album that has come out in the past 20 years.  The album sounds like country western music that has been put in a synth meat grinder and added with some U2ish cord styles, all in the layout of the Beatle's Sgt. Pepper.  The album is a vast depature from the mood of \"Hot Fuss\"...this album is more complete, more optomistic, and maybe even more flamboyant.The album begins with one of the most charged up songs I've heard in years called \"Sam's Town\".  With Flowers screaming \"why do you waste my time? Is the answer to the question on your mind\".  The song might be the best on the entire album.  It is certainly my favorite.  If you ever need to psych yourself up...just put this beauty on a turn up the volume!Next is \"Enterlude\" which welcomes you to the album and bids that its \"good to have you with us even if its just for the day\" behind a few catchy keyboard cords.\"When you were young\" is the first single off the album and probably one of my least favorite songs however it is still great...another charged up chord style rock song.  Very fast paced and edgy.\"Bling\" is a very kind of whimsicle song that really grows on you after a few listens.  The song builds into a very catchy mix of all kinds of synth sounds behind powerful bass line.\"For reasons Unknown\" is a great kind of 80's throw away song that sounds like it was made in the middle of the desert.  Really neat song.\"Read my mind\" probably the most catchy songs on the album and one of my favorites...sounds very 80s movie soundtrack-ish.  A slower song with an aluring simple guitar riff that repeats with the corus...very chordal.  Great song and sure to be another single.\"Uncle Johnny\" is a dark, guitar heavy ballad that really adds a edgy mood to the album...which is overall very optomistic...a huge departure from Hot Fuss which was very dard and pesimistic.  Great song\"Bones\" the second single to be released and another gem.  Its kind of an eiry-tune with a trumpet blowing chorus...very catchy and a lot of fun.  You will be sure to love it.\"My list\" is a slow building song that ends up becoming very catchy towards the end of the song...a really cool, fresh song.\"This river is wild\" and \"Why do I keep counting?\" are both very fun laid back songs that take the album into kind of a friendly direction that adds to the overall feel of the album.The album ends with \"Exilude\" which is very reminicent of the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts club band with the band singing once again \"we hope you enjoyed your stay, it was good to have you with us even if its just for the day, outside the sun is shining feels like heaven ain't far away\".All and all a great demonstration of the talent this young band has, as well as guts.  Many band never do a \"concept\" album...let alone one for a follow up sophmore album.  The reason is that many \"concept\" albums escape the realms of normal \"singles\" music in exchange for a crazy adventure.  Only difference with the Killers \"concept\" is that they actually made all the songs sound great.  Buy this album and you will not be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.014890153892338276}
{"text": "The follow up to Hot Fuss reminds me a lot of David Bowie mixed in with a little bit of Depeche Mode, especially with Brandon Flowers' keyboard in the songs and the heavy bass lines. \"Why do I keep counting?\" - this song is very much like something you'd hear on a Queen or Bowie album.  The song almost reminds me of \"Under Pressure\" by Queen and Bowie.\"Take me to the place where the white boys dance\" - This song has a very good bass line and good guitar riffs, but to me just sounds like early depeche mode stuff.  If you like depeche mode or Bowie, then you will love this album. It still has that element that we all love in the first Killers album, but shows a lot of growth and maturity.\"When you were young\" - This song is very much like something you'd find on Hot Fuss with it's synth background and melodic guitar barely punching through from the background. This is a great song, especially with the tempo change late in the song.\"Uncle Johnny\" - The first thing I think when I hear this song is Oasis or perhaps Bowie. This song actually at first listen reminds you of something you'd hear on an early Cure album. The song has an addictive background guitar riff. Overall a good catchy rock tune.\"This River is Wild\" - Definately shows that Springstein reference, but is done well and doesn't really copy his sound, but merely polishes it, which in itself is a compliment. Overall a great song.\"Sam's Town\" - One word describes this song; Talking Heads. The music and the way Flowers sings this song is very Talking Heads. It seems as though on this album the Killers decided to pull out all the 80's alternative albums and mix them all into one album and throw in their own small blend of lyrics. They did it well. This is one catchy album after a couple listens.\"Read my Mind\" - My favorite song on this album hands down. The harmony in the background is gorgeous. This song reminds me of something you'd hear Freddie Mercury belting out in some 80's teen flick. Great song!\"My List\" - By far my 2nd favorite song on this album. I think I enjoy it so much because it reminds me of one of my favorite Depeche Mode songs called \"Judas\" of of their album \"Songs of Faith and Devotion\". This song is great and reminds me of something you'd hear in a romance movie while a guy is walking down the street and they keep flashing scenes of his lover and their breakup. Excellent song and definately shows the versatility and growth of the killers.\"For Reasons Unknown\" - This song reminds me very much of Natalie from Hot Fuss. A good song and very vintage Killers.\"Exitlude\" - this song reminds me a lot of the Beatles at first listen, especially the background harmony sounds like Ringo belting out some Sgt. Pepper's tune or Let it Be closer. A great way to close the album with a song that sounds like you'd hear it in a small bar somewhere with close friends.\"Bones\" - Once again I hear that Depeche Mode sound especially with the keyboards in the beginning. A great 80's feel. This song sounds a lot like something you'd hear from a band like Soundteam or Pete Yorn. Nothing special, but a catchy tune none the less.Overall the follow up to one of my favorite albums of all time \"Hot Fuss\", this sophomore album was not a dissapointment. It is different than the normal killers we are used to hearing, but they show growth and pay homage to some great 80's idols and do it without copying, but by putting their own unique blend of themselves in each song. This album is one that gets better with each listen much like Hot Fuss did. This is a good road trip album. I highly suggest you get it and if you really like it I suggest you check out some of the bands they harkon to such as Depeche Mode, The Cure, David Bowie, Queen, and Sound Team. You won't be dissapointed.\n", "val": 0.020312579348683357}

Every single one of these songs are on My List of all-time favorite Killers songs. Every track is important, every track relies on both vocals and instruments, and that is one of the reasons I love this band so much. Each and every member of the band is represented in each song, and one of my favorite things to do is listen to each track a couple time, each time listening to a single part (guitar, bass, drums) to see how it helps make each song amazing. These guys really know how to write great lyrics (\"The stars are burning like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun\") and equally amazing music to lift the lyrics into something beyond reality, it's just so good. Admittedly, it took me about a week to really fall in love with each song (I used to skip over My List and This River is Wild in favor of Read My Mind or For Reasons Unknown), but like I said, each one of these songs became my absolute favorites. This is such a great album, and you know what? It's my favorite over Hot Fuss. Hot Fuss has incredible tracks that rival most of the songs on this album, but Sam's Town is the definition of a great album because of it's ability to boast that each of its tracks are pieces of solid gold that come together in the most spectacular way. I hope that with their next album, The Killers will reuse a lot of the qualities found in Sam's Town.\n", "val": 0.05569233372807503}

I think you just have to enjoy each one for what it is.I wanted to add a further comment here after having listened to this CD for over a month.

{"text": "What an album. \"Sam's Town\" (2006) is an atmospheric masterpiece that demonstrates the height of The Killers' talent. When I first heard this album in October 2006, it reminded me of themes from U2's \"The Joshua Tree\" (1987): the desert imagery, the expansiveness, the aching, the beauty, the spirituality--the originality--the notion of saying to yourself, \"wow, this music is so different and so much better than the songs on the radio.\" On this album, Brandon Flowers, born at the end of Generation X, is an expert raconteur of the American experience, something that often is not articulated well in popular culture. It's explained superbly here, however, in the clever, idiosyncratic yet relatable lyrics in the title track: \"I still remember Grandma Dixie's wake / I never really known anybody to die before / Red white and blue upon a birthday cake / My brother, he was born on the fourth of July.\" Lyrics such as these, coupled with a robust rock sound throughout the record make \"Sam's Town\" a rare thing of beauty. Then there is arguably their best song of all time, the dreamy \"Read My Mind,\" a gossamer tour de force that makes you smile and nearly tear up simultaneously, as Flowers melancholically cries out, \"Woman open the door, don't let it sting / I wanna breathe that fire again.\" I have just referenced two extraordinary songs. There are others. Such magic is hard to find. To me, it's not important what The Killers were like before and after \"Sam's Town.\" I'll leave that to others, as I am not an expert on this band. However, I do love this record. In my opinion, this is their finest work--this unique, American album--and it's a treasure to which you can return many times.\n", "val": 0.025049664080142975}

{"text": "There's no denying how massive Hot Fuss was and the incredible pressure that The Killers were under when recording this record. Following a popular and successful debut is a daunting task for any artist and surely The Killers knew that going in, yet they managed to do the unthinkable: they not only made an even better record than their debut but they also shifted their style to keep it from merely being a rehash. The end result is not only my favorite offering from the band but also one of my favorite albums of all time.The title track is the perfect opener, a muscular and bombastic piece with a decidedly more American feel than anything on Hot Fuss. These tracks are meatier and heavier while still retaining that great post-punk soundscape that they perfected initially. There are heavy traces of U2 and Springsteen running through Sam's Town, from the anthemic drive of \"Bling (Confession of a King)\" to Brandon Flowers' subtle falsetto on \"Read My Mind\". \"For Reasons Unknown\" finds his double-tracked vocals adding an extra layer of foreboding and suspense as he sings about waking up one morning and suddenly feeling no love for someone you've cared about. It's dark subject matter but one that rings all too true with the human condition.\"When You Were Young\" is perhaps the most popular track on the entire record and it remains a staple of their live sets. It has a relentless energy that's infectious and invigorating. \"Bones\", complete with horns, is one of my favorite cuts and it's a tidal wave of pure fun from start to finish. The cutting riff of \"Uncle Johnny\" is extremely cool and roller coaster ride of \"This River Is Wild\" makes it my favorite song on the album. It's breathtaking in its ability to pull you in and change dynamics so effectively. The pensive nature of \"My List\" and \"Why Do I Keep Counting?\" help to give the album  bit of breathing room and balance out fast pace of the album as a whole. The bookends of \"Enterlude\" and \"Exitlude\" are nice touches as well. In short: everything works and has its place. It flows from top to bottom and makes this a complete experience that listening to the standalone tracks just won't provide. As good as they are alone, they're even better when paired together. This is also the album where Brandon really branched out lyrically and he seems to be digging deeper this time around. Everything from family to spirituality to temptation to relationships to fame is covered and it helps to give this album a depth that Hot Fuss couldn't quite muster.Sam's Town takes some getting used to but slowly it reveals itself as an ambitious and slightly darker effort. It's almost as if this town lures you in with promises of fame and fortune, then robs you and leaves you with nothing but broken dreams and empty pockets by the end. Each listener will probably come away with their own narrative but that's the feeling I get from many of these tunes. If there was any doubt about how good The Killers really are then this record should leave no doubt: they're one of the best. Venture into Sam's Town and see for yourself.\n", "val": 0.01744571514427662}

{"text": "With Indie Rock becoming the official guiding light for the future of Rock & Roll and  The Killers as one of its biggest music acts, the band delivered another highly praised  masterpiece in 2006 when they released the realistic follow-up to there blockbuster hit  debut album two years later.  Showcased with a more exhilarating and melodic sound,  The Killers again hit the album charts with their second album Sams Town (taking the  name from Sams Town Hotel And Gambling Hall, a popular casino that band member  Mark Stoermer visited regularly in his teens) as it feature outstanding songwriting from  Brandon Flowers, the bands co-leader, where he broadens his songwriting abilities as  he follows in the footsteps of Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp, but leaves his  indelible mark for catchy melodies.  Beginning with the title track, the superlative track  set proceed with other timeless tracks, like the sweeping mid-tempo rock ballad When  We Were Young (abeited with its sweet solo piano interlude), For Reasons Unknown,  Read My Mind, This River Is Wild and the final track Why Do I Keep Counting?, which  make Sams Town another critical and commercial triumph which Flowers deliberately  lend his conceptual quality, as Hot Fuss and Sams Town solidify Flowers standing as  one of the greatest and most original rock composers ever to come on the rock scene  in a while. The album even have a serious side as the band put a spotlight on several  dark tunes like Uncle Johnny (about a drug addict on his downward spiral), while rest  of the album take a bold look on the bright side of life, whom The Killers handles with  excellent rapport and terrific skill.

On the first listen of `Sam's Town' I realized how quickly The Killers matured from two years back. They surpassed that dancing tune from their first album and decided to try something new. The results in my opinion were magnificent.Different is not a bad thing, and even though the quartet from Las Vegas did let go a bit of their original roots this album should be valued at least for their efforts. `Sam's Town' should be owned by any alternative music fan.\n", "val": 0.0010106274858117104}

I've never really been a huge Killers fan, but I figured I'd give this album a listen after enjoying most of their first one. It was evident from the first five seconds that they'd over do it with the keyboards. For me, keyboards are definately hit-or-miss, and The Killers missed on their sophomore album. Aside from the album being drenched in unnecessary keyboards, it wasn't to incredibly awful. After a few listens, most of the tracks weren't half bad, and I started to focus on the positives. I liked that the album recieved less mainstream attention than their debut and that the album only included one \"Mr. Brightside\" that was constantly on the radio and everywhere else.

Everything in \"Sam's Town\" seems to sound clumsy and forced, and none of the songs are actually *about* anything. This CD must have been a huge disappointment for fans of \"Hot Fuss\", the terrific debut album which made an instant success of an apparently talented band not afraid to use keyboard sounds from a long-dead era.Indeed, a friend and I were who were huge fans of \"Hot Fuss\" were really looking forward to this album when it came out. But when we listened to it, we both agreed: it was hopelessly mediocre. It was as though the Killers, after one big success, literally had no idea what to do next. I imagine that other fans felt the same way. And I can believe that the absence of a resultant dip in The Killer's popularity is simply owing to the fact that a huge body of \"Hot fuss\" fans have been displaced by people whose musical tastes are about a notch above the Kylie / Britney scene.The melodies herein are so-so; but the major problem is the lyrics. They are completely artificial. Very often Brandon Flowers sings them with awkward vocal inflections and palpably no conviction, as though he is literally unable to believe what he's saying. Which is hardly surprising when you consider lines such as:\"He doesn't look a thing like JesusBut he talks like a gentleman\"Really? What girl, pondering her blind date, has ever lamented that he doesn't look a thing like Jesus? Who exactly do the Killers think they're kidding? On and on the album goes like this, for song after disappointing song.This album is a crying shame: some bands start have an awkward start with great potential, then that potential blossoms in the next album. The Killers, by contrast, had the perfect start and then went on to produce ... this.\n", "val": 1.9568751667975448e-05}

I've heard their new single, \"Human\" that's due to come out on their next album this Fall and I'm stoked.  It sounds like a continuation of Sam's Town, even though it's a little club'ish, and I don't club nor dance.  It's a great sound, 80's-esque but definitely their own.  I hope their around together for a long time, and that they maintain their individuality.  I'm shocked that Sam's Town is only $5.99 on Amazon MP3's.  It's a worthwhile download.

I don't love it, it's not going on my top ten list of all times, but it definitely is better than a lot of the stuff that has not only been released lately but that I've actually bought.I definitely love the energy of Sam's Town, and the kick off single \"When You Were Young\" actually makes me quite giddy. The pseudo classic style of \"For Reasons Unknown\" and the music build up to the end is pretty thrilling and reminds me of many bands before.\"Read My Mind\" is probably one of my favorite tracks on the album, and again has that sort of retro feel. Supposedly influenced by Springsteen this time around, Brandon Flowers' vocals remind me more of classic singer Roy Orbison than Springsteen's growl and even the music doesn't seem as Springsteen-ish as it does 80's rock/new wave people like The Fixx or even INXS.Of course there's a little more rock steam in these pipes than INXS and that comes through on almost every song even the ballads like \"My List\" which I like a lot as well. The winding guitar loops of \"Uncle Jonny\" and Flowers' voice is cool and once again it reminds me of songs that have come before.In fact, almost every song reminds me of someone else and it becomes a tad distracting trying to figure out who they sound like in each song.

{"text": "Disappointing follow-up to their multi-platinum smash debut, \"Sam's Town\" owes less to the synth/new wave/post punk stuff they mined so successfully on \"Hot Fuss\" as the emotional epic rockers of the 70s, such as Meat Loaf and most notably (and most obviously) Springsteen's \"Born to Run.\" But this is no \"Born to Run\" (not even close, in fact) and the band's attempt at maturation and broadening is met mostly with indifference.Which of these identities defines this band? \"Hot Fuss\" was more a collection of good songs than a proper album, but their debut is considerably better than \"Sam's Town.\" Since they seem to look to \"Born to Run\" as a model, it's a simple comparison. \"Born\" was a start-to-finish rock album, but it had the great individual songs to go along with it. \"Sam's\" follows that epic pattern, but the Killers seem more confined (even trapped) by the formula, and the tales grow wearisome and bland. It's an interesting experiment, but either it's not what the band really wants to do or it's not what the band is capable of doing well.The songs have little juice and even less identity. It's a sorry state of affairs when first single, \"When You Were Young,\" was a let-down the first time heard and yet remains one of the better tracks on the album. The other hit, \"Bones,\" barely registers on the first couple of listens. Even album highlights like \"Read My Mind\" and \"Uncle Johnny\" wouldn't compete for airplay with their best hits from \"Fuss.\" Although this is not a bad album by any means, it still becomes yet another of the dozens of sophomore albums in recent years that fails to meet the promise of a strong introduction. A mixture of overreaching ambition and sudden-fame pretension makes for a bad tonic.Best cuts: \"Uncle Johnny,\" \"Read My Mind,\" \"When You Were Young,\" \"This River Is Wild,\" \"Why Do I Keep Counting,\" \"Bones,\" \"My List\"\n", "val": 6.730978202540427e-05}
{"text": "I'm writing this not as a critic, not as a Killers fan, but as a music lover.  I'd only heard \"Mr. Brightside\" off \"Hot Fuzz\" and was really moved by it; the lyrics matched my experience during a tumultuous time in my life.  In fact, I never bought \"Hot Fuzz\" for that very reason; that song matched my experience a little TOO closely.It just so happens that last fall found me in a very similar situation.  As I've done at other difficult times, I turned to music to help soothe my feelings and to help make sense of what had happened.  I picked up a copy of \"Sam's Town\" (along with CDs from several other various artists) from the local public library and gave it a spin.  And once again, I was blown away.  I'm a sucker for a catchy tune, and the Killers are nothing if not catchy.  But the lyrics--God!--were what really struck me.  Feeling the pain of broken dreams, being \"sick of all my judges\" (\"Sam's Town\"); remembering the anticipatory thrill of seeing someone I loved (\"I pull up to the front of your driveway, magic soaking my spine\" from \"Read My Mind\"); realizing that one of the main aspects of truly loving someone else is wishing for THEIR success (\"I don't shine if you don't shine\" from the same song); wishing desperately for one more chance to prove myself to someone I loved but had let down (\"My List\"); and who knows how many other similar insights--this album summed them all up in a beautiful, messy package.I acknowledge that musically, \"Sam's Town\" is a little high on bombast--it's more Wagner than Mozart--but man oh man, is that a breath of fresh air.  It's certainly what I needed.  To me, the bombast said, \"Don't be afraid of your passion. If you're gonna fail, at least fail BIG.\"  (\"Start a huge, foolish project, like Noah. It makes absolutely no difference what people think of you.\" [Rumi])So sure, maybe I filtered this CD through my somewhat altered perception during a difficult time, but isn't that what we all do?  It's only a matter of degree.  At its best, music can serve as a safe way of experiencing and expressing difficult emotions; through some sort of alchemy, it can help transform them into something even more precious.  Along with the support of true friends, this album done that for me over the past month and a half.Which brings me to Brandon Flowers's apparently often-ridiculed statement about this album: Is it one of the best albums of the last 20 years?  For what it's done for me, I'd say it is.  It's helped give me hope during a very difficult time, more so than any other record I can think of.  It's quickly become one of my favorites of all time, and is among only a few that I can imagine turning to again and again to remind me of where I've been, where I am and where I hope to be one day.Finally, for the people who gave \"Sam's Town\" lousy reviews or who couldn't see past the bombast, or who worried that the singer wasn't quite hitting the notes to their satisfaction, I have only one question: Are you really so robotic and clinical?  Come on, live a little.  Live a little BIGGER.  Remember what's most important to you; remember what it's like to lose it.  And then ask yourself one more question: Am I really that much different?\n", "val": 0.00922561064362526}

They were just another generic piece of whatever music happened to be selling at the time. Poppy, catchy, fun, but completely lacking any kind of depth that would make them worth listening to more than once. Then I was thrown a 180. I heard the first single, When You Were Young, and something about it grabbed me. Clearly the same band, but something about that song was sounding different then everything else I had heard by them. Then I heard another song off the album, I can't remember which, and I was surprised to find that I was really digging it. It wasn't long before I decided I might actually have to buy this album, and this would be no routine purchase, contemporary music is not my thing. The most recently released album I had purchased before this was Weezer's Green album, based entirely off the strength of the music they had released in the 90s, and it was a huge let down for me.I started with the first three tracks, and they were good. I was surprised by how good they were, but I really wasn't liking the beginning of that 4th track, and I put the album away for a while. After a few weeks I put the album on again, for another go, and this time I actually listened to the whole thing. I was amazed. The fourth track isn't all that satisfying when it starts out, but it quickly develops into a very enjoyable song. I was surprised to find most of the songs had a very nice build up in a similar fashion. When I was finished I was convinced I had heard one of the best albums released in a very very long time. I jumped online to see what kinds of praise this album had received. Were the Killers everyone's new favorite band?No, not at all. Not even close. I was taken off guard when I discovered that the album was not well received at all, not even by their own fans, despite the huge growth in between the former album and the current. Everything about the album showed drastic improvement and maturity. These weren't songs written with the intention of getting two or three good singles, and there was no filler here. This was a real, cohesive album, like bands used to make in the glory days of music.It's not hard to see why this album was dismissed so quickly by the general public. It's the same thing that happened with the Pet Sounds album by the Beach Boys back in the 60s. The music had grown far too complex for the pop loving fan base they had begun with, and anyone that actually would have enjoyed the brilliance in the music would never believe the group was capable of creating it. I have a feeling Sam's Town is destined to the same fate. It will disappear into obscurity, with only a small group of loving fans to keep the memory alive.\n", "val": 0.0006015761173330247}

{"text": "SAM'S TOWN immediately hits the listener with a sound that is significantly different from HOT FUSS. If it wasn't for the vocals, it would be fair to say you were listening to a totally different band. This type of change is risky in a new band; the fear being that fans will be alienated. Personally, I love when bands continue to evolve and search for new sounds and themes. It keeps things from becoming boring and it prevents that, \"Didn't I hear this before?\" feeling.The question is it successful? The answer is, \"Yes.\"Hard driving anthems relating to genuine emotions triumph over artifice and The Killers pull it off very well here. Flowers' voice strains for creditability when pushed, but he pulls it off and while lacking the force of many other rockers, his vulnerability makes the songs that much better. While they don't all come off with the same power , the songs hold up in their new settings and  the total package comes together. While still not a classic, this is a worthy effort from The Killers and I hope they continue to push themselves to make music worth listening to.\n", "val": 0.03274045139551163}

I like every song though there are some that I like more than others (which is the same with Hot Fuzz).The music is a bit bolder, and a bit more grandiose (musically and lyrically), but the synth is still there and after giving the album a listen or 3 you'll be singing along to each track.  The lead singer's (Flowers) voice sounds a bit different to me on this album, but not for better or worse, just slightly different.  The album definitely seems to be more mature (but I have no idea where the Springsteen analogy came from), the songs and the hooks aren't as poppy (at least not in every song) and it takes more than one listening for some songs to grow on you.  (For instance I didn't like 'Sams Town' (track 1) the first couple times I heard it, but now its one of my favorites).Overall, if you like popular music, or alternative music in general... its worth listening to, but I wouldn't expect a life altering experience.\n", "val": 0.0216675978153944}

I was driving as Read My Mind spun up when I first played the CD.  I had to pull off the road to avoid being a danger to myself and others.  Nothing has changed in the hundred or so listens since then -- it is as thrilling a four minute compendium of longing and bravado as anything I've heard in a long time.  (And, for me, it doesn't hurt a bit that its two bridges -- \"the good old days; the honest man...\" etc. -- recall David Garza's wonderful Crown of Thorns on his Overdub CD.)  Nothing on the rest of the CD quite reaches that same high point and even the best songs of the second half, e.g. Bones and This River is Wild, come off like reworkings of the strongest material on earlier cuts, e.g. Sam's Town and When You Were Young.But here's the thing -- The Killers are not afraid to stretch themselves.  No playing safe here.  They do bombast fit for an arena, they do humor, they do tender, and, with this bittersweet Valentine to their home town, they tell a pretty good story.  Some of it doesn't work so well; a lot of it does.  My personal guess is that as they mature there will be more and more successful blendings of those disparate elements.  As they say about NFL draft picks, there's a lot of up side in this band.  They just have to keep producing more \"It's funny how you just break down/Waitin' on some sign/I pull up to the front of your driveway/With magic soakin' my spine\" and less \"am I strong enough/to be the one/will I live to have some children.\"\n", "val": 0.009702014736831188}

{"text": "With the release of the Killers' debut album Hot Fuss, their sound helped usher in a revival of the new wave sound (something that I, a big fan of `80s music, had absolutely no problem with). Now they come back at us with Sam's Town, an album that is getting very heavily mixed reviews. But I think it's somewhere in the middle.At first, though, I had to make sure that this was really the Killers. Not that their sound is any different, but, well, it's still the same four guys, but they look, like, ten years older now (and drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. now looks like Jason Lee). Anyway, I wasn't that much into \"When You Were Young\" for a long time, but it's really grown on me now. But my favorite song would have to be the current single, \"Read My Mind\".There are also a few songs on here that sound like Brandon and the boys are shooting for an arena rock sound. Not that the songs sound bad, but I think listeners would appreciate them more if they were heard at live performances. Oh, well; \"This River Is Wild\" and \"Bling (Confession of a King)\" are decent enough.But then you have a group of corny tracks like \"My List\", \"For Reasons Unknown\" and \"Bones\" (sorry; I never liked that song). And the intro and outro are pretty cheesy too (and shouldn't the intro be the first track instead of the second track?).

{"text": "Wow! Eight months after its release this cd continues to absolutely blow me away. Twelve songs of irresistible non-stop energy, clever changes of pace, forceful yet sensitive vocals, endless hooks and lyrics that beckon the listener to sing along, loudly. This may not be \"one of the best albums of the past twenty years\" as Brandon Flowers proclaimed. However, it is without doubt one of the best releases of 2006. One of the hallmarks of a classic record is that it stands up to repeated spins. For me, Sam's Town accomplishes this in spades. In fact, the more I become familiar with these songs the more I enjoy them.On this record one terrific song follows immediately on the heels of another. There are twelve tracks. The cd runs for just 44.14, once again proving that length is far less important than quality. Some of my favourite recent cds are about the same length as a traditional LP record (the second Arctic Monkeys is 37.34). As a die hard rock and roller I don't need filler and I don't want cuttings from the studio floor - tunes that would never previously have seen the light of day!Superficially this record reveals more American influences than the debut. There are the obvious vocal and lyrically similarities to Bruce Springsteen. Flowers has mentioned in interviews how he has \"rediscovered America\".  However, when all is said and done, what I hear are the same influences as on Hot Fuss - Queen, Bowie, and 80's Britmusic. Anyway, the band's sources of inspiration are, when all is said and done, irrelevant. This is a superb sophomore effort. I reserve five stars for the best of the best - Revolver, for example. Sam's Town is a worthy four and a half star effort. Will the Killers be able to make it a hat-trick? We'll see.\n", "val": 0.021576862782239914}
{"text": "Nice album. I picked up Hot Fuss on an impulse because one of my friends was always singing somebody told me. The first time I listened to it only a couple songs stood out to me. So I listened to it again cause I figured I spent 15 bucks on this thing. I'm getting my money's worth. To make a long story short I loved it. So the day Sam's Town came out I went to the store and bought it. My first listen through I was looking for those songs that you know that you will hear on the radio eventually. Nothing really stood out to me besides When we were young until I got to Exitlude and I thought this one aint to bad. Then I let it cycle through again and was I hooked. It only leaves my car now when I want to listen to it in my room.I hear people saying that they rushed this albulm and that they need to take more time then 2 years to make a new albulm. I say Bull. Have they ever checked out how quickly the Beatles nocked out albums? They even recorded their debut albulm in about 10 hours. Please Plese Me and WIth the Beatles were both in 63, Plus the Magical Mystery Tour came out the same year as the legedary Sgt. Peppers, with the White Albulm coming soon after. Plus you have Rubber Soul which came out Dec, 65 and Revolver in Aug, 66. Did I mention 4 of those are in the Rolling Stone top 500 albulms of all time.Now I'm not comparing The Killers to The Beatles by any means, that just isn't a good argument to me.Sam's Town start off the albulm and is one of my favorates on the cd. Constantly changing but flowing smoothly. Flowers has some nice raw vocals on this song.Enterlude and Exitlude are both nice sing alongs thought they are both pretty short they hold that albulm together as book ends.When We were young is the first single and the one that I am sure many people bought the albulm. Some compare to Mr. Brightside but really has not a whole lot on common except they're both Killers songs. This is much more guitar driven the Brightside. Great track.Bling seems to me to be inluenced a lot by U2. Flowers voice has a haunting effect to me. Kind of like Lennon on \"A Day In the Life.\" I love the bridge on this song. It just kinds of repeats higher and higher but just soars to a climax before ending with a mellow outro.For Reasons unknown starts off reminding me of My Charona (which I am sure I didin't spell right).Read My Mind is another great track seems to get a lot of radio play. At least when I've been listening to it. Makes me think of my home town. \"On the corner of main street... can you read my mind.\" I love the sound in the background during the begging and end of the song that sounds like the wind blowing through a tunnel. Well written song with some very catchy lyrics.This is the only song that I have any gripe with, though it is still one of my favorate. . \"When everybod else refrained, Uncle Johnny did cocaine.\" Who saw that rhyme coming. Just sticks out a little to much for me I guess, but the rest of the song is well crafted. One of my favorate things about the band is when the others due some vocals together. It's just got this sing a long catchiness going on.Bones is yet another great song. It reminds me more of Hot Fuss then any of the others on the albulm. Great verses and an awesome chorus. Ussually I am not a big fan of saxes in most music out side of blues but it fits in so nicely with Synths. Flowers sounds great during the bridge when there arn't any drums or brass. Stands out at just the right point of the albulm.My List has some coolest synth work that I have heard in a long time. This is the slowest song on the albulm. But shows a depth that is more evident here then anywhere else on the cd.The river is wild is another of my favorates on the cd because of Flower's vocals. The song just has this energy that I like. Fast slow fast slow. Great Lyrics and bridge.My favorate is Why do I Keep counting. It is just so diverse in sound but all fits together seemlessly. Love this one.This albulm deffinenly shows a growth and maturity of the band in all the right directions. Flowers has nearly mastered his songwriting skills.  Their sound changed yet it is not different and if you loved the first one, than this one is a great move in their progression and is definently worth picking. I see a bright future.\n", "val": 0.0021548159420490265}

I agree with many of the reviews that you have to listen to it about 3 or 4 times to really appreciate it. It's a completely different style from Hot Fuss, and if you really like songs like \"Smile like you mean it\" for example, you may not like this one as much, as it isn't as outright loud and rock ish sounding, even though there still are rock songs. Nonetheless, my favourite songs are \"Read my mind\", \"When we were young\", \"List\" and \"Why do I keep counting\". I think the music the killers have come up with in this cd is much more to my personal taste - in the 3 or 4 days I've had it, I've already listened to it more than I have Hot Fuss, which I've had for years. I was quite surprised to see that there are actually a few soft, romantic love songs, (which I didn't know the killers could pull off!). And, not in a cheesy way, but this cd has a much more inspirational and uplifting tone [you'll see what I mean if / when you buy it], and besides \"Mr. Brightside\", I didn't find too many songs on Hot Fuss to be 'pretty' with beautiful melodies, but this cd's packed with them. It's just great songs after great songs. Basically this cd gets better and better everytime I listen to it, and I find myself constantly tapping my feet or nodding my head, and in general, this CD makes me smile whenever I hear it. It would be a HUGE mistake not to buy it, and I think anyone could enjoy it, whether you're a killers fan or not.

{"text": "..it would probably sound like this: the unholy and unlikely marriage of Robert Smith and Bruce Springsteen. I don't think I've ever heard a more misguided effort by a band whose heart is clearly in the right place. While 2004's Hot Fuss was a derivative affair, putting Psychedelic Furs, Smiths and Cure into a blender, this record is dominated by one artist and one artist only...THE BOSS! That's not unique really. John Mellencamp has managed to emulate Springsteen for 30 some years but The Killers are definitely the wrong band to score \"Eddie And The Cruisers\". The lyrics are pulled right out of Born To Run 101 with hurricanes on fire and couples needing to get out of this two horse town and so on. While Brandon Flowers has mastered Springsteen's delivery right down to the vocal quivering he strangely tries to keep one foot in New Wave-ville by channeling Robert Smith. It's an odd sound and one that Flowers himself may regret since I've noticed that he's re-recorded some parts for the singles \"Bones\" and \"Read My Mind\".  By the way the first single \"When You Were Young\" is the one track that actually works in the context of Bruce-meets-Ultravox. \"Read My Mind\" is a close second and \"For Reasons Unknown\" is \"Mr. Brightside\" part two (go ahead...sing \"Mr. Brightside\" to yourself over the chorus...I dare ya). There are two wraparound tracks that would give the impression that this is a concept album but the only concept here is Brandon Flowers walked into a record store and bought Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits and was blown away (a true story).Look I like these guys and they helped to give rock a shot in the arm back in 2004 so I WANT them to succeed but they really need to find a direction that works for them. I can understand that they didn't want to make Hot Fuss: The Next Generation and I've read all the reviews here...\"Can't you see? They're changing their sound? They're progressing! Don't expect Hot Fuss again!\"....Guys...IMITATING BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IS NOT PROGRESSING..you've gotta be kidding me? I can only assume that you don't already own any Bruce albums..well, if you love Sam's Town you're going to REALLY love Born To Run.It's one thing to be influenced by someone and certainly Hot Fuss showed the band building upon it's 80's inspiration but Sam's Town perhaps goes a little too far in it's hero worship and the band sound unsure and unsteady about who they are.In short, a few good tracks, one oustanding one and maybe more for the Bryan Adams crowd than the Morrissey fans.

I like musicians who let their emotions take control of the song and the vocals rather than standing in a studio trying to hit every note perfectly like a robot.

It causes such a raucous of criticism, during the making and after the release of a follow-up album. Being that I was one of the many who fell in love with their first album I was highly anticipating their sophomore album. I will admit it isn't what I wanted or expected. And some of the harsh criticism by many of the \"major\" critical magazines across the nation do hold some merit. However, the album does have bright spots here and their. \"The River Is Wild\" is a wonderful track and my personal favorite on the album. Some of the writing feels like Brandon Flowers was searching for something profound, and he fell short with most every attempt. This album is a long way from being great. But it is a good album. I recommend it to any fan of The Killers. But I am sure if you read this far you already own it.\n", "val": 0.005946682300418615}

As an indie fan, they are one of the very few bands I like from modern radio.

{"text": "If you've been reading reviews of this album, chances are you've seen a lot of people calling it a work of genius, and a lot of people calling it a wagonload of [you know]. Personally, I think it's neither, and I'd like to offer a more balanced assessment for the benefit of the undecided record-buyer.First, the cons: If the first Killers record teetered on the edge of overproduction, this one goes over the edge hard and fast. It's very slick, and there is too little continuity between the songs - it ends up sounding more like a compilation than an album. Brandon Flowers' voice, which worked strangely well on their debut, sounds a little out of place on this one. The arrangements don't mesh well: is it stadium rock, or is it synth rock, or is it some kind of Springsteen-influenced country-rock thing? I get the impression that the band was pulled in all three directions at once, while trying too hard to make a diverse and epic masterpiece. Also, this may be a personal thing, but I find the artwork uniquely ugly. The bighorn sheep (or whatever it is) next to the mannish prom queen, in front of a trailer, makes for an asymmetrical cover with various unpleasant associations but no apparent meaning.The pros: I was afraid that the Killers would turn into a vapidly commercial bubble-gum group, of, say, Daniel Powter caliber. It happens to a lot of bands on major labels; but fortunately, not this time. That slightly sick, slightly twisted *something* that set the Killers apart to begin with is still here. There's nothing quite as unsettling as \"Midnight Show,\" mind you, but you still get the feeling that these guys have a real dark side, which goes a long way toward making them more interesting than their peers. The songs, in terms of writing, are less solid than those on Hot Fuss, but they are energetically performed and (mostly) have good melodies.Bottom line: I recommend it if you are prepared to forgive some serious shortcomings, including its being nothing like Hot Fuss. I get the feeling that the band was anxious and uptight while they were making it, like maybe the record executives were looking over their shoulders the whole time; but, I've heard worse, and still I think the Killers are a band to watch.\n", "val": 6.174348527565598e-05}

{"text": "Purists will probably dismiss this album as a cobbled together pastiche of pop-rock references that tend to hover inexplicably around the year 1985. Gen-Y New Wave enthusiasts will most likely be oblivious to that and dismiss \"Sam's Town\" for not sounding enough like \"Hot Fuss\". Thirtysomething music fans like me, however, might enjoy the resonant echoes of Bowie, Queen, U2, Echo & the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, New Order, Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Smiths and most obviously (and occasionally hilariously) Bruce Springsteen, while not taking the whole thing as seriously as the band perhaps would like us to. I like Springsteen, but tracks like \"My List\" and the obvious \"Born to Run\"-homage, \"This River Is Wild\", take it a litle too far. On these tracks, rather than sounding like Springsteen, frontman Brandon Flowers sounds more like Robert Smith's devoted young American son fronting a senior prom band. Still, I really do enjoy this album, much as I enjoyed their last, not least for its enthusiasm. It's the kind of retro-fusion fun you can imagine a free-wheeling R.E.M. indulging for an album (and a little more insightfully), though it's unlikely to be the basis for an entire career - even for a band from Vegas. Flowers does himself no favours with his press persona, but his lyrics have an angsty ambiguity that makes The Killers slightly more interesting than many of their contemporaries. And no band that simultaneously counts Springsteen, The Cars and Morrissey amongst their key influences, and has the sheer audacity to hire Alan Moulder AND Flood for their sophomore effort, can be dismissed without some consideration, even if the result isn't always good.

The second song released to single, Bones, holds a beat that has to be danced to. Other songs that have not hit the radio yet (my fav on the cd so far is Read My Mind) tie the whole of the LP together well.

{"text": "Although \"Sam's Town\" wasn't very well-received by critics as well as a good number of The Killers' prior fans, I would say that this album is more or less equal in quality to \"Hot Fuss\" even though the styles of the music on these two releases are quite drastically different. I myself was at one point one of the fans discontent with this album; it took me five whole listens to the CD before I fully appreciated it for what it was (I certainly agree with the reviewers who have said that this album grows on you). \"Sam's Town\" probably takes some getting used to because of its vast deviation from The Killers' former style; the only track that still clung to their new-waveish synthesizer format (as heard in past hits \"Somebody Told Me\" and \"Mr. Brightside\") was the hit \"When You Were Young\", which surprisingly seems to have faded off of the radio stations already even though it's in my opinion one of their best songs if not their best yet. I also quite enjoyed the songs \"Uncle Jonny\", \"Bling (Confession of a King)\", and the title track: \"Sam's Town\". There are a few factors that degrade the album, however; I consider the softer track \"My List\" a fairly weak effort along with \"Enterlude\" and \"Exitlude\", which venture on the corny side while also sounding like painfully obvious filler. Still, I hardly think this album deserves all the bashing it has been getting, and I would recommend that those who didn't like \"Sam's Town\" on the first listen try it again multiple times; I would have given it three stars if I had reviewed it after one listen but now after five listens I would give it four and a half stars (I buy CD's that I rate 3  or higher typically). In conclusion, I'd say The Killers made a good move by daring to be a little less mainstream and trying a style that maintains a different and more alternative style of 80's influences. It may not have directly benefited their overall success as a band, but at least they can know that there are indeed people out there who appreciate this sophomore album for being different. I would give \"Sam's Town\" four and a half stars, and would certainly recommend that it be purchased since the music's good and the band needs some support for the risky move they took with making it.\n", "val": 8.785491809248924e-05}

{"text": "Here is the thing.Hot fuss was mostly a novelty album. Sure, it was good - but if you were over 18 you had to almost convince yourself that it was ok to like it, ok to love it even. And after loving it, which many of us wound up doing, we naturally assumed that the next Killers record would have to be the same. Only Sam's Town is not a novelty. The sound is bigger and a bit harder to digest - especially because of the way the vocals are delivered and the less synthpop vibe. As a sophomore album, it succeeds because it keeps the catchiness of the first Killers record and adds a more edgy, adult sound.At first, I thought this sound was forced, and after reading an interview with Brandon Flowers I thought that the Killers had overestimated their talents because of the grandness of their ideas. But I recalled the early U2 - how grand it was and how grand it got, and I justified Brandon's attitude. You have to think big to get big nowadays...that is just how it is.The only thing about this album that annoys me now after repeated listens is the choir at the beginning of \"Bones.\" It completely messes up the flow of the album - but other than that, don't give up on this - I think this album takes the Killers out of the novelty category and proves that they are here to stay.\n", "val": 0.0007650969200767577}

If the original Killers sounded like a tribute to gritty turn-of-the-80's Iggy Pop and the Cure, the new Killers sound more like a tribute band to the Killers -- almost like they are doing a cheap cover-band imitation of themselves.  Aside from the popular radio single \"When You Were Young\", the rest of the album is nearly devoid of the catchy hooks and mind-penetrating off-kilter melodies that abounded in Hot Fuss.It looks like the sophomore curse has reached yet another band.

{"text": "Let me preface this review by stating that I am not a fan of the Killers mostly for reasons of their style and approach. I find the band- much like groups such as Interpol, the Bravery, and Franz Ferdinand- self-absorbed and abrasively irritating in their rehashing of the past (i.e: the 80s synthpop and post-punk/british jingle bands) and selling it to 16-20 year old alternative girls. In all honesty, my opinion is that the Killers are nothing but Ultravox without the talent with a bit of pathetic Robert Smith/Midge Ure aping in one Brandon Flowers thrown in for good measure- from what I have gathered, Mr. Flowers has taken his megalomania to new heights, aping the Boss, Springsteen himself. Being a fan of 80s new wave/post punk, I find the Killers and bands like them not so much a fun \"homage\" as I do an insult to intelligence and taste.That being said, I must admit that there are worthwhile moments on their sophomore effort Sams Town. I can slightly agree with the U2 references everyone picks up on, but I believe there are a few other influences coming through on the record. While the heavy John Foxx-era Ultravox influences of Hot Fuss remain, they often take a backseat to vaccuous attempts at Springsteen and 'Joshua Tree' era U2. Besides, listening to Sams Town, it seems the Killers have graduated to Midge Ure-era Ultravox, with Flowers' vocals being so obviously lifted from Midge that its audacity is insulting. The lyrics are so empty and self-important in their attempt to present slices of \"Americana\" and everyday life that I often found myself splitting my time between chuckling and cringing- good examples are the first single, 'When You Were Young,' which truth be told, I found enjoyable, but more or less a sad attempt at aping 'Mr Brightside.'The influence of Flood and Alan Moulder are apparent on the eponymous title track, and on the more epic tracks, as the strings are highly reminiscent of the Smashing Pumpkins' 'Tonight, Tonight,' (produced and mixed by the pair)- the wall of sound in the introduction of Sams Town is impressive and \"epic\" in every sense, yet the music- like the majority of the record- is pedestrian and runs out of steam before ever leaving the starting gate. More often somber and meandering than passionate, the Killers musical section seems more bored than anything else. Like the Pumpkins' Mellon Collie, Sams Town wants to be huge and ridiculously over-the-top but still relevant. Where the Pumpkins succeeded on every level, the Killers stumble over themselves and fail.With the follow-up single, 'Bones,' the band gives an \"interesting\" attempt at melding glammy Roxy Music with 'Head on the Door'-era Cure (i.e: the 'Close to Me' horns).'For Reasons Unknown,' if given more work, had promise. However, like every song, it has embarrassing lyrics ('I look a little bit older/' I feel a little bit colder') that are downright dumb and seem reaching to \"say\" something, but ends up saying nothing at all.The vocals are something I see alot of people complaining about on the Amazon boards. Now I'm no Mensa member, but I know that warbling eccentric cry anywhere, and yes, that mouth usually has bright red ill-applied lipstick on it. Throughout the album, Flowers gives the listener his best Robert Smith impression through his deliberately cracked/wannabe cutesy \"sensitive guy\" vocals.Musically, the band seems to be on cruise control here- too many times, the arrangements of the songs are awkward and sound like they were haphazardly thrown together during soundchecks(a good example is 'For Reasons Unknown'). The guitarist sounds just as all these other 80s retro bands' guitarists- and like them, he misses the point of that era of music and the playing; attempting to make his guitar sound quirky and off-kilter, it just sounds flat and is as compelling stylistically as erectile disfunction.'My List' is downright boring and neutered. Many will defend it by arguing it is \"atmospheric;' but come on! This is flat and uninspired trash- good atmospheric music in this vein is Ultravox's 'Your Name (Has Slipped My Mind Again).' Eventually, it erupts into a faux-Motown type number that frankly eludes the bands' musical depth (or lack thereof).I give this album two stars mostly for the Killers' pompous and misdirected attempt at musical growth and \"maturity.\" *AHEM* A testament to too-much-too-soon, what results is, whether one likes it or not, an unintentionally entertaining trainwreck of a band that has let its self-importance grow like a cancerous tumour, overshadowing the naive charm it held for their fans in the first place. Please buy an Ultravox album and spay and/or neuter your pompous wannabe 80s retro pretty boy bands.\n", "val": 6.139880861155689e-05}

{"text": "`Sam's Town' is The Killers' follow-up to 2004's `Hot Fuss.' That latter album was quite the monster throughout the world with rich production values - showing enormous vision and competency on the part of the band and its production team - that clearly showed how deeply The Killers were in thrall to British influences as diverse as The Fall, U2, and Oasis. But, had `Hot Fuss' been nothing more than an imitative and/or derivative paean to Britpop, it would likely have died like an unwanted hooker on the streets of Las Vegas. But, the music - while familiar - was part of an atmospheric aural vehicle that carried dense, thoughtful narratives about relationships and their demands and responsibilities.The explosive success of `Hit Fuss' resulted in The Killers becoming a world-wide phenomenon that was heavy rotation on both sides of the pond. Among the events the band had as campaign streamers were Glastonbury, Live 8, Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Late Show with David Letterman, Top of the Pops as well as a host of edgier shows; quite a step ahead for a band that was formed in 2002.Along the way the band has gained some notoriety for what might be referred to as rock star bravado. Between claims that the follow-up album would be \"one of the best albums in the past twenty years,\" to critical, caustic comments about other bands, some have wondered 1) is the band full of themselves and 2) can they deliver an equally strong second offering.I'm here to say that the answers to these questions are \"Yes,\" and \"possibly no.\" While `Sam's Town' does contain some strong insightful observations on life, music and the cost of stepping out on the notional global stage, when one views the CD as a whole, it is less consistent in song quality. There is also a decided shift in some of the underlying foundations from which this band draws its inspiration.Where `Hot Fuss' was the band's view of Britpop, \"Sam's Town' has a strong element of American influence. This is most obvious in \"When You Were Young,\" and \"This River is Wild;\" both hark to the wall-of-sound thunder of `Born to Run.' There are also nods to Bon Jovi in \"Uncle Jonny,\" which - while coming down against cocaine - takes a somewhat sympathetic view of the abuser. After several listens, I had to conclude that the band was talking about someone they know.The overall album is a bit of a concept product, too. The title song addresses the issue of success, with its chorus \"You know I see London, I see Sam's Town/pulls my hand and lets my hair down/Rolls the world right off my shoulder/I see London, I see Sam's Town,\" delivering a retrospective view of what success entails in terms of prices to be paid.The next nine songs are contained within a song cycle structure that starts and finishes with \"Enterlude\" and \"Exitlude,\" respectively. They set the stage - in tone and content quite similar to the works of Ray Davies - for the aforementioned nine songs that follow the band's penchant for analytical study about relationships. However, whereas `Hot Fuss' was about interpersonal relationships, \"Sam's Town' addresses the more problematic issue of being in rock `n' roll. This is not to say that you will be listening to a concept album. The songs are not linked in that manner. (So, it is not Endless Wire/Wire and Glass!). But, you are aware that Flowers et al have been doing some thinking about whom and what they are. The problem I'm faced with is that the issue remains unresolved as to whether the band is looking back with some yearning for a simpler time even with its implied lack of success, or whether they are thinking about their position as legends in their own minds.It is this latter concept that pushed forward when I listen to the Springsteen/Bon Jovi based material. That bombast can - if not truly heartfelt - end up being just that: bombast. I would also comment that Flowers' vocal range does not fully encompass this style. His voice shreds on a couple of tracks, particularly on \"For Reasons Unknown.\"Overall, 'Sam's Town' is a very good sophomore effort, but one where style and content are a bit erratic.\n", "val": 0.017901957035064697}
{"text": "On first listen of 'Sam's Town', I didn't much like it and bought the album thinking it was going to be a twin to 'Hot Fuss'.  However, with every listen, this album just improved.  'Sam's Town' is more polished than The Killers freshman album and the songwriting is fantastic, not repetitive like some songs from 'Hot Fuss'.  Although 'Hot Fuss' will always be one of my favorites, 'Sam's Town' has won my heart.  It has more of a rock sound than 'Hot Fuss' ever could and the influence of U2 and Bruce Springsteen are apparent.  This album probably will be looked back upon as one of the great albums of the last 20 years.  Yes, I said it.  4+++ stars for this album!\n", "val": 0.0644271969795227}

{"text": "It must be profoundly difficult to create the followup to a big-selling first album. Give the people what they want or follow your artsitic vision? The former may lead to good sales, but even the most ardent fan will get tired of the \"same old thing\" eventually. The latter may be artistically satisfying, but will probably alienate your existing fan base. What to do?It seems that The Killers have threaded the needle pretty well on their sophomore effort. Upon reading some pre-release reviews, I was convinced that the CD would sound like the love child of \"Born To Run\" and \"A Night At the Opera\". It's nothing of the kind. The scope is bigger and the influences are broader (and yes, the Boss is definitely in there), but fans of the band's first work should have no trouble finding something to enjoy here.  Sam's Town, When You Were Young and For Reasons Unknown are standout tracks.That being said, I do find that, for me, it's not as compelling as \"Hot Fuss\". I played it fairly heavily for the first two weeks or so, but its time in my CD player has dropped off dramatically since then. This is not to say that it's not a good CD. It just doesn't match up with my personal tastes quite as well.  I figure I'll trot it out in a couple of weeks and give it another listen.The bottom line is that current Killers fans should not be afraid to give this disk a spin. New fans (is there anyone left?) should probably start with \"Hot Fuss\".\n", "val": 3.3610260288696736e-05}

The Killers did exactly what they should have. They made an awesome record. I feel sorry for all of the one-dimensional people out there that can't get past their previous album. As big of nerd as I am, I'm not even that boring. Even I like change and exploration. The Killers are making music for people that can actually think. People who enjoy only force-fed schlock shouldn't even think about purchasing this record. You'll be disappointed that \"Mr. Brightside\" didn't rise like a phoenix from your jewel case for a fifth or sixth encore. Give me a break. I feel sorry that The Killers are plagued with whiners and complainers. What happened to loving and appreciating great music? What happened to applauding great talent? Sure \"Sam's Town\" is more conceptual than \"Hot Fuss,\" but what's wrong with doing something a little different?  I feel like some of their fans are penalizing them for being progressive and forward thinking.  Maybe their last record was too much of a novelty and set somewhat of a trap for them. It put them in a box that they ultimately planned to step out of. Because \"Sam's Town\" is a great record and people really should be more open-minded. Wake up kiddies!!! This album is more complex and has more depth than \"Hot Fuss.\" Go listen to a boyband if you want manufactured hit after hit. \"Sam's Town\" is for people that like good Rock music.\n", "val": 0.00029850041028112173}
{"text": "The Killers' much anticipated follow up album SAM'S TOWN doesn't come across quite as \"sheeny\" (for lack of a better word) as The Killers' double platinum debut HOT FUSS did.  While some may view that positively or negatively, one must not forget that that albums sporter first-rate singles including first \"Somebody Told Me\", followed by the even more infectious, ubiquitous \"Mr. Brightside\", and closing with the slightly less embraced, though strong \"All These Things I've Done\". Let's face it people, we were all singing the words to \"Mr. Brightside\" and we couldn't resist singing the lines \"I have soul but I'm not a soldier\" from \"All These Things I've Done\".  SAM'S TOWN is consistent with HOT FUSS and even hearkens to be bigger, more athemic in some respects compared to their debut, but it isn't any better and in some respects it isn't as fun as the debut.Sure, \"When We Were Young\" is the addictive single from this album when frontman Brandon Flowers sings \"He doesn't look a thing like Jesus\", but it isn't as addictive or as predominant as the hooks from either \"Somebody Told Me\" or \"Mr. Brightside\".  Sure, the Killers want to be taken seriously and SAM'S TOWN is a good move in that vein of thinking, but it isn't enough to topple the greatness of HOT FUSS.  Opening track \"Sam's Town\" is certainly a first rate experiment with more U2 veined rock and roll and while it isn't quite as convincing as U2, it is convincing enough.  The tag at the end of the track certainly works well as well as the chorus.  The timbre of the track is also first rate.\"Bling (Confession of A King)\" is another solid first rate track, mixing \"college\" rock with the added \"sheen\" of keyboards.  \"Bones\" is another stand out and \"The River Is Wild\" isn't too shabby either.  Too often on SAM'S TOWN everything sounds that same as opposed to being its own seperate entity.  Is SAM'S TOWN bad.  No, it is another solid album and maybe even to an extent an move in the right direction for the Killers.  But it isn't extraodinary and it doesn't necessarily trump any of the best rock releases of 2006.  However, I do think that hardcore Killers fans will enjoy this release and maybe even the non-fan may even be converted.  3 stars.\n", "val": 0.02494664490222931}

There are a band that uses meloncholy new wave sound that is able to put smiles on peoples faces and have them sing along. 'Hot Fuss' was a real coming out for this band but their new cd 'Sam's Town' is not getting the same vibes from many people. This new album has the fans split right down the middle. The first single 'When You Were Young' is just not getting the same feeling as 'Somebody Told Me.' Yet this group is not going in the wrong direction. This is a band like many before them that plans to stick around for while by experimenting and trying new things to see how far they can go. Those types of bands are the ones that stand the test of time. 'Sam's Town' is a real triump there are great songs on this record and even some that keep the origional Killers sound. Songs like 'Bones' and 'See My Mind' keep the fans interested while the rest are a new breath of fresh air which is what the music world so desperatly needs.

{"text": "The Killers return with their sophomore set, \"Sam's Town\". This time out, they emerge more confident and with a harder guitar-driven edge. The synths are still here, but they're pushed to the back, or utilized to help the melodies along. There are plenty of hit singles here such as their first, \"When You Were Young\" with its U2-like chorus and guitar flourishes. The title track is a mix of Duran Duran and Rush while \"Bling (Confession Of A King)\" and \"For Reasons Unkown\" emphasize the tougher guitars while maintaining a delicate balance of synths. \"Read My Mind\" would be my choice for second single. The band hits a few speed bumps along the way during the second half of the disc with \"Uncle Jonny\" and \"My List\", but this is more than compensated for with other good songs \"Bones\", \"This River Is Wild\" and \"Why Do I Keep Counting?\".The Killers avoid the sophomore slump issue and show that they are here to stay.

This group sounds like the E-Street band fronted by Robert Smith.  If you liked their last album, pass on this one.  If you dig more \"adult-contempory\" stuff, this may be right up your alley.  Not the worst album I've ever heard, but thank god for P2P (limewire/Kazaa/Bittorrent) else I may have been sukered into buying this one.  If you like the electro-dance punk sound go check out a band called \"The Faint\".

{"text": "Many people are dissapointed by the new sound of this album, the new sound in tracks such as Sam's Town, Bling, For Reasons Unknown, Uncle Johny, and Read My Mind. I too was at first turned off by this new sound, that shows no parallel to Hot Fuss. These songs lack the catchy, \"sing along\" quialities as the songs in Hot Fuss, and almost sound \"emo.\"  However, for me it was an aquired taste, and after listenting to the album a few times, I was hooked.As the rest of the songs such as When You Were Young, Bones, My List, This River is Wild, and Why Do I Keep on Counting: simply amazing. Sam Flowers switches back to his Hott Fuss-esque tone (not even sure if Flowers was lead in the others), and we get all the great elements we know and love about the Killers: strange but catchy lyrics, choruses, songs that are fast and slow at the same time, unique instrumentals, and the somber tone that somehow puts you in a great mood.

I felt like that band took each song in a new direction. None of them felt recycled or tacked on. I was surprised as I listened to it how different one song was from the next. This made for an exciting listen that will provide a lot of replay value.The runtime of the album is just under 45 minutes. It seemed a little short to me - though I have no idea what the average runtime of a record is. Actually, I was surprised when the CD was over. Usually, even on some of my favorite albums, I have to skip a couple of songs that are just filler. I did no such thing here, so the concise runtime is a credit to the \"all killer (pun definitely intended) no filler\" catch-phrase. I'm happier with an album that delivers throughout even if it is less lengthy than comparable releases.All-in-all, I'm glad to say, SAM'S TOWN is a worthy follow-up to HOT FUSS, and hopefully means that the Killers are here to stay.Buy this album.\n", "val": 0.028322990983724594}

While I liked Hot Fuss a lot, there were only a few songs that I kept in my Itunes library. There were a lot of throwaway songs I thought. On This CD, almost every song is good. I fell in love with the \"When you were young\" song and was not let down on the rest. It's a good cd that reminds me of every band I've ever loved put in a blender. I hear the Misfits sometimes (just a little), the Smiths, Depeche Mode. Sometimes it sounds like Placebo. It has almost a religious, weird choir music feel to it at times which I think is great. People say it sounds like Bruce Springsteen. I don't hear that, but whatever.
