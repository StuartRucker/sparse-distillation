The king of could've-been songs, Rolling in the Deep explores ADELE's anger and her attempts to sort out the mess that the relationship became after such a promising start. Right before the chorus lies the songs hidden melodic strength as it back builds, reminiscing on how she got her emotional scars. But as the chorus begins, we are left in no doubt that while their relationship showed some promise, it would ultimately fail because her lover refused to play by the acknowledged rules of romantic rights of way.

{"text": "Adele (born Adele Laurie Blue Adkins on May 5, 1988) really turned out some song with \"Rolling in the Deep!\" Although the lyrics explore a woman's feelings after a love affair ended unhappily, the melody is remarkably catchy and even a bit upbeat especially when Adele sings the words \"we could have had it all.\" The music fits in perfectly with Adele's vocals and makes \"Rolling in the Deep\" one of the best tunes I've heard in a while.Adele's voice, as always, is flawless; I love her contralto sound and she never lets go of a superfluous note! There are some backup vocals but Adele doesn't really need them even though they do sound pretty good--Adele easily carries this song on her own. I highly recommend this song for anyone just getting into Adele and people who appreciate moving and unforgettable pop music.\n", "val": 0.048673562705516815}

After listening to it while driving on vacation, my husband (who usually only listens to (gulp) country music) asked me if he could borrow it to listen to in his work truck!!  You actually feel Adele's pain from the failed romance in the songs.  Rolling In The Deep is great, and I love the drum beat.

Adele is responsible for making me stand in front of the bathroom mirror with a hairbrush singing my heart out for hours.  She is one of the few artist left in this world that can actually SING, and some people criticize her for her weight.  She is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen and she sings like an angel.

It definitely is the best song of all the ones I listened to by Adele but I'm sure I haven't heard everything great that she has done.  I loved the way Amazon has it set up to listen to all the recording artist who have ever done Rolling in the Deep and also every rendition that Adele has done,well I assume from all the different listings that they covered everyone.  All I had to do was set up a Cloud account for free and download it to my DJ DITTY and then also to my Droid phone.

{"text": "It took quite some time, but this song seems to have finally taken off. It's a good thing, too, as the success is well-earned. From the opening notes to the explosive chorus, Adele carries this song like it's the last one she will ever sing. The instrumentals never overtake her voice, and she sings with such passion that it's impossible to not feel her anguish. The lyrics are incredible, the vocals are spot-on, and the beat is perfect; this song lacks any glaring flaws, and as such deserves the number one spot on Billboard that it has earned.Hopefully radio continues to play Adele; it would be nice to see 'Turning Tables', 'Rumour Has It', 'Someone Like You', and 'Set Fire to the Rain' get some major spins. There's enough material on the album to keep Adele on radio until her third effort drops; here's hoping they're able to get behind some real talent!\n", "val": 0.032684244215488434}

I like how strong the song really is, and how Adele really brings in a striking feeling into the song. It really is a nice and strong statement, especially from acts like Lady Gaga and Rihanna who've made really awful songs this year, that haven't been worth their weight in the dough.

I feel that Adele is great with strong, forceful songs such as Rolling in the Deep and Set Fire to the Rain as she has a rough and deep voice.

Her smash Rolling In The Deep brought so many people into her heart, and warmed so many other hearts. But with all of that joy, she hadn't yet made a follow-up single for her 21 record. Her latest single, Someone Like You, the second single from 21 is a simple and somber torch song. She really gives out her voice brilliantly on the song.

Not only has she really delivered with each and every album, but her voice really has ignited in the way that divas have done before like the great Whitney Houston or British legendary divas like Dusty Springfield. When she came out with 21, she really ignited a fire that really has been more authentic than the joke divas name Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles, because she has had altogether the voice, and the songs to match at the heart and soul that work better than met the eye. When Adele released 21, she made everyone listen because she had a great set of songs at the heart, and Someone Like You, the second single from the album is no exception. The song is really one that ignites from the soul and the mood. Adele really delivers with each and every withering note of the song, and it does not get tiring or overplayed, unlike product divas like Nicki Minaj or Britney Spears.

I recommend Da Doo Ron Ron as well as all the early Spector stuff, and the Beach Boys Pet Sounds, which is inspired by Spector.

These tracks have never sounded so good, in both impact and detail. This is state-of-the-art remastering, and a tribute to an important girl group as well as an overview of how an important producer evolved in a relatively short time.The earlier hits (recorded at Mira Sound in New York) find Spector setting the girls' quintessential sweetness in a seductive uptown sound defined by booming drums and classical flamenco musical accents. The Crystals halcyon days came with Spector's move to Los Angeles' Gold Star Studios: they rode the Wall Of Sound on powerhouse epics like \"Then he Kissed Me\" and \"Da Doo Ron Ron\" - heard here as never before. What's especially of note is how good the not-so-succesful later records sound with this new remastering. Quite clearly, Spector was ahead of the technology but kept creating anyhow.\"Da Doo Ron Ron: The Best Of The Crystals\" deserves nothing less than a five-star rating: it's undoubtedly one of the best girl group discs ever, in both content and dynamic sound quality.\n", "val": 0.021939830854535103}
{"text": "The Crystals formed in 1961 with Barbara Alston as their lead singer. Quickly signed by Phil Spector for his brand new Philles label, they were the subject of the label's very first single, first hit and first Top 20, \"(There's No Other) Like My Baby.\" They struck gold again the following year with the Mann & Weil's brilliant \"Uptown\" and reached #1 with Gene Pitney's \"He's a Rebel.\" Oddly, the latter single, the group's only chart topper, was recorded by a completely different set of Crystals - Darlene Love and the Blossoms - than the one who'd first broken on the charts. The story has the original Crystals touring the East Coast at the moment the demanding Spector was ready to record in Los Angeles, and Love's group was on hand.The Love/Blossoms Crystals hit one more time, in 1963 with \"He's Sure the Boy I Love,\" before the original group regained their name with \"Da Doo Ron Ron,\" \"Then He Kissed Me,\" and \"I Wonder.\" Well, sort of. \"Da Doo Ron Ron\" had been recorded by Darlene Love and the Blossoms, but Spector replaced her lead vocal with one by Lala Brooks, to whom Alston had ceded the lead vocal role in the Crystals' stage show. The latter two singles also feature Brooks with Love and the Blossoms providing the backing vocals. The East Coast group split with Spector and Philles shortly thereafter, and amid additional personnel changes recorded a few more non-charting singles that failed to capture the thrills and grandeur of their hits.This disc collects the group's ten charting singles (which also include \"Little Boy\" and \"All Grown Up\"), B-sides, album tracks, the short-lived A-side \"There's No Other Like My Baby\" (which was flipped to make \"(There's No Other) Like My Baby\" a hit), and the quickly withdrawn \"He Hit Me (It Felt Like a Kiss).\" Two rarities - the hard-swinging unissued-at-the-time \"Heartbreaker\" and the previously unissued LaLa Brooks-sung \"Woman in Love\" fill out the disc. This isn't a complete exposition of the group's recordings (their early version of \"On Broadway\" would have been a nice inclusion), and some will complain about the all-mono line-up, but with ABKCO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Best-of-the-Crystals/dp/B000003BDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Best of the Crystals</a>&nbsp;out of print, it's great to have the group's hits and and B-sides available alongside collections for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ronettes/dp/B004GHBQEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ronettes</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Darlene-Love/dp/B003102JKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Darlene Love</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Phil-Spector/dp/B003102JKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Phil Spector</a>.

{"text": "The Crystals were Phil Spector's most successful girl group and the mainstay of the Philles label through the early sixties. Like most of the girl groups before Motown, they were from New York and were one of the groups that defined the New York Sound. I remember being really surprised when i learned that Phil Spector lived and recorded in L.A.' But it's such a New York sound', I thought. The Crystals and Ronettes were from New York, and even more than that, the songs were composed by the great Brill Building composers like Goffin & King, Weil & Mann and Barry & Greenwich, and the Brill Building was just north of Times Square. Spector himself learned production not only from Stan Ross at L.A.'s Gold Star (where he would record most of his songs) but also went to apprentice with Lieber & Stoller in the Brill Building. This is why an early hit like Uptown has a sound similar to The Drifters.The group formed in 1961 with the help of their uncle, Benny Wells, who had played in big bands; they were named for his daughter, Crystal. Phil Spector and Lester Sill had just formed Philles Records (Phil & Les) and, looking for talent, signed The Crystals right away. In early '62 There's No Other Like My Baby became the label's first Top 20 hit and already showed the amplification of the girls' voices with echo and reverb. Such sudden success meant television appearances and tours in Cavalcade of Stars type formats with lots of groups and performers from all Top 40 styles.The big hit came in the Fall of '62 with He's a Rebel, and it's such a strange story I just have to tell it, though I'll try to keep it short. The song was written by singer Gene Pitney, who was also breaking out with hits like Town Without Pity and (The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valence. It was first offered to The Shirelles, but they turned it down because they didn't like the idea of the boy being bad. Spector meanwhile had recently taken the job of head of A&R at the Liberty label, a major independent. They had it slated to be Vikki Carr's next single, but when Spector heard it he knew it had hit potential and decided to beat Liberty and record it himself. Now Phil Spector may have been a brilliant producer who supervised every aspect of his operation, but he wasn't a particularly nice person. Like Alfred Hitchcock who famously called his actors \"cattle\", I believe Spector thought the songs were all about him, and the singers were really just another element in the mix. And with a full Phil Spector production with its many backup vocalists, band members and engineering tricks, in a sense he was right. The Crystals were on tour and couldn't get to L.A. as fast as Spector needed to beat Liberty to the punch. So he had Darlene Love & the Blossoms record it but then put it out as The Crystals, probably because they were his big hit group and that would guarantee airplay. The actual Crystals had to promote it as their own and Darlene Love couldn't say anything. He's a Rebel hit #1 in the country on November 3, 1962 keeping Gene Pitney's Only Love Can Break a Heart from the #1 position.That was not a one time thing for Spector. He used Darlene Love & the Blossoms on several other crystals releases, sometimes with Crystals' lead Dolores\" La La\" Brooks. four early Darlene Love & the Blossoms songs were put on The Crystals' Greatest Hits album. The Crystals weren't done with hits yet. They continued their streak with the upbeat He's Sure the Boy I Love in late '62  and in '63, the big year of the Girl Groups they had two classics, Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me. These were full, all-out Spector Wall-of-Sound productions that seem to have been recorded in the Bayreuth Festival Hall with a cast of hundreds. They sounded great, delivering a feeling of excitement unheard of on a 45RPM record. Spector may have been inconsiderate of his performers but he gave his all to the recordings.Then He Kissed Me was the last hit for The Crystals. They later claimed that once he signed Ronnie & the Ronettes, he neglected them. That very well could be true, but their two low-charting 1964 songs, Little Boy and All Grown Up are on this collection and they are good songs given the full production. 1964 was the year of The British Invasion,and that was what was probably having the biggest effect on The Crystals' career.This is an excellent retrospective and I can't imagine a better one coming out in the near future. It is from EMI, now part of Universal, and has been beautifully remastered and is better than the 1992 ABKCO disc with the pink cover.\n", "val": 0.0025771772488951683}

Sony Legacy have done a masterful job of cleaning up the Crystal's recordings.

If you are looking for the best (and the cheapest) way to get the very best of the Everly Brothers without tracking down their individual CDs I suggest you pick up \"The Complete Cadence Recordings 1957-1960\", \"Walk Right Back: The Everly Brothers On Warner Brothers 1960-1969\", \"Stories We Could Tell: The RCA Years\" or the twofer \"Stories We Could Tell/Pass The Chicken And Listen\", and \"The Mercury Years\" CDs to get a complete overview of Phil and Don's recording career from it's beginning in the mid 50's to their final album for Mercury records \"Some Hearts\" in 1989. Also, grab a copy of \"The Very Best Of The Everly Brothers\" released on WB in 1964 for some re-recorded songs from the Cadence years. Yes you'll spend about three times as much as you would if you bought this collection, but you'll get about five or six times the amount of music, and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect if you decide to pick up their entire back catalog. I hope you've found this review helpful and informative. Thanks for reading. PS The Everly Brothers 4CD box set \"Heartaches & Harmonies\" and the three catalog box sets from Bear Family will give you everything that the Everly brothers recorded from 1951 to 1972, but you'd be looking at a price tag of about $800.00 for all of those.\n", "val": 0.003224974498152733}

It's not a typical Spector production in that it doesn't have the \"wall-of-sound\" string section -- just a raw rhythm section, supplemented with piano and sax parts that just rock it to bits throughout this short and sweet ode to nonconformity and the love of a good bad boy.A must-have.\n", "val": 0.026180049404501915}

{"text": "Having fallen in love with nearly all of Jonny Craig's work over the last few years, this release caught me off guard initially, but it has become one of my all time favorite albums, and that's really not something I say lightly.The depth, creativity, and musicianship is top notch from the first to last song.  There is not one weak spot on this album...although some reviewers aren't as big on the later songs, I actually feel they flow together in a very Abbey Road side two way.  And although it is billed as a sequel to their first full-length, it is a very different sounding album.  The playfulness of the self-titled LP and Happiness has been combined with the sheer intensity of Downtown Battle Mountain.  Obviously Jonny puts it over the top with his amazing voice and signature swagger, but not one member of the group is outshined.I liken the album to an onion which has layers that can be peeled back to reveal more and more substance.  Having listened to it hundreds of times, I have focused on nearly every aspect and always been rewarded.  At first, it was the vocals, which are impossible to ignore and superbly done.  Next was the drums, as that's my main instrument and musical passion, and the patterns, creativity, and execution are outstanding.  The guitar work is mesmerizing as Jon weaves his pieces in and around each other.  And as each of their other albums, nobody is stepping on anyone else's toes.  The parts fit together like a jigsaw puzzle that form a greater piece, the music, yet there is detail in each that can be appreciated.There's nothing much to say other than you either get this band or you don't.  I have friends who are musicians and music lovers that really don't understand my fascination with this group.  I would highly recommend purchasing the album and giving it a repeated listen.\n", "val": 0.013447304256260395}

{"text": "I wasn't too familiar with this band, it was recommended by a friend.  Despite having pretty varied taste in music, I haven't listend to any groups with screaming vocals, so I was a little unsure at first.  Thankfully, there were enough hooks and creative guitar work to keep me interested, and slowly the screaming grew on me.  I'm not about to start listening to a bunch of other post-hardcore bands, but DGD has gotten the perfect mix of hooks and screams down, to the point where they definitely won me over as a fan.EDIT:  It's been a couple months now and I can still say this is a fantastic album that I listen to quite frequently.  Don't let the screaming scare you!  These guys have amazing talent and the screaming will grow on you.  I buy a fair amount of music, and it's hit or miss.  Sometimes I buy an album and it feels like I wasted ten bucks, other times I buy one, and get a couple hours of enjoyment out of the music and it's forgotten.  And *once in a while*, I buy an album as awesome as DBM2 and it feels like I hit the jackpot and my ten bucks pays out tenfold.\n", "val": 0.00021258267224766314}
{"text": "Unlike most reviews for this cd I'm not going to waste your time bickering about lineup changes and just focus on how awesome the music is. \"Spooks\" is an excellent opener for the alblum that is a very well put together song that showcases each member's incredible skills. Even though he's insane, I don't think anyone can deny Johnny Craig can sing and every song really showcases that. Jon Mess's scream has, in my opinion, improved greatly and he does a great job of mixing his absurd and strange lyrics to his serious one. The istrumentals are, of course, amazing with some excellent drumming from Matt Mingus and the typically incredible riffs Will Swan (who actually raps a little on this album, sometimes it complements the song, sometimes not) provides. Highlights include \"Pounce Bounce\" which switches from laughable, to serious, to sarcastic and serious, mainly courtesy of Mess's lyrics which include \"I\"m lethally overdosed on pumpkin pie\" and the potentially offensive \"What's it like to be an atheist?/Are you okay with suicide?\". There's also the superb \"Elder Goose\" which is very catchy for DGD and contains some of the best moments in the record where both vocalists are singing. It has a slow, intense chorus and is somewhat reminiscent of \"Caviar\" from the self titled album. \"Heat Seeking Ghost of Sex\" is classic DGD featuring some hooks (of course not radio friendly at all though), some of Mess's best screams to date, and the usual great guitars. After this song, the album becomes a little more melow and focuses more on Johnny Craig than anything else, which really isn't that bad because he is extremely talented. \"Previously Ponchieezed\" is my personal favorites from that group of songs, and builds up towards the end in a similar way to \"The Backwards Pumpkin Song\". All in all, if you're reading this review, you already know DGD so you won't be disapointed with this album so I urge you to buy it.\n", "val": 0.01608663611114025}

ENJOY!\n", "val": 0.014742426574230194}
{"text": "Finally, the wait is over! The anticipation has now subsided and audiences can behold the return of Dance Gavin Dance.  Being a fierce, DGD/Jonny Craig fan myself, I will try not to emphasize facts most fans will already know.  For instance, Jonny Craig's return to DGD should already be known, and that outside of Sean O'Sullivan, it is the vintage lineup all of us fell in love with years ago.  However, I do feel that Jonny's return certainly put fans on an emotional high, especially paired with Jon Mess's vocals.  These two have forced me to return to the reasons I truly fell in love with the band.  We've witnessed Jonny's departure, a replacement vocalist, and two records later, we are here on March 8th, 2011 about to have a nostalgia rush.  I certainly don't dismiss the previous two albums, they were great and enjoyable, but without Jonny, to me, something was missing.Now, let's get to this.  DBM is still frequently cycled through my itunes and played in my car at max volume.  The overall tone and atmosphere of that record encased powerful lyrics, vocals, and immaculate musicianship.  Many people are wondering if DBM2 will dethrone an already prominent predecessor.  On that note, I have never listened to an album that felt so complete and distinct than DBM2.  Within minutes of the first track I was convinced the record would be a success.  Nevertheless, my conclusion was correct; DBM2 took me for one of best listens of 2011.  The raw talent of Craig, Mess, Will, Eric, and Matt sent me for one gripping experience.  I listened to the album in its entirety more than 5 times before switching out to relax.  In light of Jonny's absence, his godly voice improved with Emarosa and his solo work.  DBM2 is one of his strongest performances yet.  Although there are times when I wish his voice reached higher pitches, the emotion behind his talent still reaches audiences the same way.  Certain words don't have to be screamed to understand the message.  Just as Jonny uses his skill, so does Mess.  I can't stress enough how crisp and defined his vocals are on DBM2.  It came to the point where sometimes I wanted to hear Mess more than Jonny, not to say one is better than the other.  Both compliment each other on a \"symbiotic\" level.  Also, Will's guitars and lyrical abilities shine through as clear as day.  I get severe goose bumps when he takes center stage be-it guitars or the quick rap segments.  Both Matt, and Eric bring out the guns as well.  Their performance on DBM2 is unmatched compared to DGD's previous work.  With the gifted talents of all members, DBM2 is a sure contender for best album of 2011.The overall tone and satisfaction of the album is unrivaled.  Each song flows right into the other and further cements DGD's status as one of the most innovative bands of today.  I will deduce each track individually and pay respect to opinions of others as well as my own personal judgments.1.)SPOOKS (5/5) - One of the most powerful intro songs of any album I've heard.  Jonny leads off with a quick soulful line, only to be followed by Mess's relentless screams.  The instruments kick in and give that sudden rush of urgency, \"Hey DGD is back, so here we come.\" Some of the most passionate lyrics come from the end of this song by Craig, \"I knew the onely road it took to get there...\" Also, Will showcases some of his talents towards the end and really makes the intro track feel complete.  It's a culmination track....2.)POUNCE BOUNCE (5/5) - sticking to what DGD knows best: pleasing the fans.  This song is a true reminder of DBM.  Mess tears this song apart, one of his most stellar performances on any record.  The song is short, but packs one heck of a wallup.  After the conclusion of the album, I found myself coming back to this song.3.)THE ROBOT WITH HUMAN HAIR PART 2.5 (5/5) - NEED I SAY MORE!!!!!!4.)THUG CITY (5/5) - \"AHA!!! DANCE GAVIN DANCE IS BACK BABY.\"  As stated so well by Craig, they have returned.  One of my personal favorites on the album because it makes me think of the long road of each of the musicians and how they ended up here.  Will's guitars are insane during Jonny's clean sections and send chills down my spine. Matt's drums are also a high for me here.  Craig raises his voice so well here that his distortions are mind-numbing.  The climactic ending builds and builds with intensity inevitably leaving you awe-inspired.5.)NEED MONEY (5/5) - I can't say enough about this song.  It keeps the pace of the album up and never really lets up.  Probably one of the best songs on the album that demonstrates how instruments can truly alter the mood of a song.  Their influences are laced in every second of the song and are empowering.  Craig's choruses are some of my favorite on the album and truly compliment the vivaciousness of Mess's screams.  PLEASE LISTEN!!!!!6.)ELDER GOOSE (5/5) - a bit slower than the others, but not so much that the rhythm of the album is diminished.  Lyrically, I find this to be one the most passionate songs on the record.  The poignant lyrics of Craig are raw and gripping.  His soulful approach to this song is beyond comprehension. I can't say enough about this track7.)HEAT SEEKING GHOST OF SEX (5/5) - obviously by this point many of us have heard this song because it was one of the singles they released a few months ago.  It is the most rigid and relentless tracks on the record.  A true dedication DGD as a band.8.)BLUE DREAM (?/?) - Here is where things get dicey...many people I have talked to or read online that they are appalled by this track. That it doesn't fit the DGD sound and should have been disregarded early on.  However, being the optimist that I am, it has actually grown on me.  I know it may sound like one of Jonny's solo works, but DGD is so close to home for Craig, so why not utilize some of his raw talent. it's like paying homage to his routes.  I found it to be a testament for him to return to the band that really made him so popular.  Instead of giving it a number I figure you can decide for yourself instead of basing it off my judgments.  The passion is there....9.)PRIVILOUSLY PNCHEEZIED (4.5/5) - oh those blue eyes...LISTEN TO IT!!!!!!!!!10.) SWAN SOUP (4.5/5) - almost as relentless as HSGOS. Still ten songs in and we are undergoing a revitalized DGD. The emotional state of this song is so elegant. I implore you to please listen to this one.11.) PURPLE REIGN (-/-) - I always leave the closing song up to audiences. The conclusion of all albums affects fans differently.  Are we left wanting more or are we satisfied?  You be the judge here. DGD is back baby and I couldn't be more excited.Finally, they have returned.  DBM2's pacing is immaculate.  All of the members are performing at top notch. instead of taking audiences to the familiar DGD sound, they have pushed it beyond what cuold be expected.  I am left speechless.\n", "val": 0.011361408978700638}

We've all been there where we've been scoping somebody out all night and you can't put it off any longer.<<<Words>>> Makes me sway everytime.<<<Are You The Right One>>><<<Outfit>>> Wasn't feeling this one at 1st, but it latched on.

I have the Tempations G.H. I love them but I definitely wasn't expecting to get my doo-wop on with this album. Another reviewer said it's the same topics they've heard before. All about love (having it, losing it, missing it, tryna find it...) Okay, what u want him to sing about....seriously. Google \"songs with love in the title\" and watch what u find. Duhhhh. Bobby ain't the only one on a love kick people. Yes that's the content of this album and yes we've heard it all before but I think he does a great job as a parrot. Matter fact, I appreciate a man singing about love over a woman singing about it so I really love this disc. What I'm tired of is hearing women cry about getting their heartbroke and being dogged out (but I buy those cds too, lmbo). I will agree with one low reviewer that some songs sound very  much alike but to me it sounds like one long melody. I hate when I'm listening to a cd and I'm all soft and mellowed out and the next song is on crack and bouncing all off the walls. I prefer the consistency. If you are not familiar with Bobby V or the music he makes, do yourself a favor and preview this album before you buy it. If you already love Bobby click \"add to cart\".

{"text": "I want music listeners to know that Bobby Valentino's debut album, \"Disturbing the Peace Presents Bobby Valentino\" is one of the best albums to be released in the last ten years. It is a timeless classic!  \"Fly on the Wall\" is not as good as his debut, but substantially better than \"Special Occassion.\" He is easily one of my favorite artists to come out in recent history. I like the fact that he is talented, educated (Clark-Atlanta alumnus), handsome and a class act.I heard \"Words\" on AOL Radio and was thrilled to learn that he had another album on the way. I saw him promoting it on Twitter. I am glad I listened to it. It's lengthy, 18 tracks, but who can't appreciate an artist who gives a consumer their money's worth?  Bobby was kind enough to include club tracks, mid-tempos and ballads. He does all he can with his voice, another thing music listeners should appreciate. \"Hummin'\" is a nice track which features a good rap by Lloyd Banks. He remakes Bobby Brown's classic, \"Rock Witcha\" and though this version is nice, Bobby Brown's version trumps Bobby Valentino's. Bobby joins forces with Plies on \"Phone #.\" This song is about getting a girl's number so they can have phone sex. \"Grab Somebody\" is another highlight, it features the king of fast-rapping, Twista. It's a mid-tempo about grabbing someone you are attracted to.\"Fly on the Wall\" is a good listening experience overall. Some moments are better than others, but it is an enjoyable LP.Mikeisha's Top 51. \"Hummin'\"2. \"Words\"3. \"Alter Ego\"4.\"Rock Witcha\"5. \"Sweetness\"\n", "val": 0.027447225525975227}

{"text": "I am tired of hearing the same rap over and over again, so I decided to explore the latest R&B offerings.  Yes, R&B is not what it used to be because great singers have been replaced by model wannabes.  Musicians have been replaced by the single hip-hop 'producer' DJ.  It makes for simplistic, boring and repetitive 'music.'Sadly, Bobby V fell victim to having to do the same old stuff with the same old beats and the same old style of 'singing' as we have heard over the past ten years - although material in roughly the first half of the last decade (2000's for those who do not realize that we are in a new decade)was pretty good for the hip-hop DJ 'producer.With that said, Bobby V talks about the same thing throughout the album.  How much \"I want you,\" \"I need you,\" \"I got to have you,\" \"I can live without you\" and \"I want you body\" songs can people sing?  Songs are incomplete and I feel more like I am listening to a hip-hop mix-tape instead of what should have been a smooth R&B album.Bobby V spends too much time thinking that he is sexy and not enough time making good music.  I tried my best to like it as I want something to like.  I had to listen to The Temptations just to ease my mind and hear REAL signing with REAL music.  I say avoid until R&B singers ditch the hip-hop DJ 'producer' and get that live band of musicians to make the music as singers should have.\n", "val": 4.3013558752136305e-05}
{"text": "I was flipping through channels one day and I spotted Bobby V on 106 & Park. Usually, I could care less about the show, but that particular day, I watched it specifically for him. After he made his appearance, he announced the release of his new album. Recently, I have had mixed feeling about Bobby V and his music; you can tell he understands that R&B really needs help, but he also wants to be like all the others and have his hands in the pop/rap genres as well...so you can tell I was a little apprehensive about his new album. I downloaded his album and skimmed through it to hear the type of beats his album contained and automatically, I was interested! I sat back and listened to the album in its entirety and all I can say is I'm impressed! THANK GOODNESS THERE ARE ARTISTS OUT THERE THAT STILL BELIEVE IN TRUE R&B!!! In my personal opinion, I can't decide which album is better-- his very first album or this one! I mean...naturally, there are going to be songs on anyone's album that do not appeal to anyone. The songs I really do not care for are:-Altered Ego-Hummin-Phone NumberNot to say that the songs are horrible, but honestly.....I have developed a taste of finding rappers' music distasteful and repulsive. Not to say that the rapping on this album was composed of lyrics disrespectful and \"typical,\" but I just do not care to hear the rapping (between the beats of the songs and the rappers, it just isn't a good combination in my opinion). Other than those 3 songs, I feel his album is accurate to what R&B should sound like! Too many singers are trying to develop \"club bangers\" that they forget to incorporate the true roots of R&B! With \"Fly On the Wall,\" Bobby V did a wonderful job of presenting music that has a positive meaning,  showing his vulnerability and desire to meet a good woman, yet making it \"gender friendly\" to where a man, a woman, or a couple can enjoy the album together! To be honest, I do not feel as though the album will get the EXPOSURE it deserves because it will only appeal to those who appreciate REAL MUSIC! There are too many artists out there that make repetitive, disrespectful, risque lyrics to appeal to the masses; with this album, it seems like it will only appeal to the more mature, experienced ones that can relate to the things he talks about on the album.I personally feel as though this is one of the best albums that has come from Bobby V! Keep it up Bobby! Listeners like myself who can recognize the deterioration of good music appreciate his hard work and anticipate more! Bobby...you are not the only one out there that believes R&B is just as dead as hip hop! People please keep artists like Bobby in the music industry! We need more singers like Bobby V that don't believe in following trends!!! I also noticed a review where an Amazonian reviewed the album as a \"same ole Bobby\" because of his lyrics. In absolutely NO WAY am I trying to disrespect the reviewer because I do respect everyone's opinion, however, in my opinion, I enjoy hearing Bobby's point of view on longing for a good relationship and a good woman; speaking from a good woman's point of view WITH MORALS AND HOME TRAINING...its refreshing to see that there are still men out there who long and desire a REAL WOMAN (no offense to anyone)! PLEASE SUPPORT REAL/GOOD MUSIC!!!\n", "val": 0.00011364935198798776}

{"text": "I think that Bobby is an excellent artist with lot's of talent but the content of this release leaves a lot to be desired. The songs don't deliver as you would expect Bobby V would. The first half of the album is alot like twins,there are some differences in the tracks, but basically they're the same. The last half of the album sound like tracks of other artist redone by Mr. Valentino. I so adore the artist but I am not feeling this release though I do appreciate his covering of Rock Witcha.\n", "val": 9.668328129919246e-05}

I have to say i came away very happy with my purchase. Very good uptempo tracks and slower songs do have his classic vibe to them.The thing I did not like the most is the order of the tracklisting. It did not seem to have a gradual tempo it was more like morning traffic with(speed up then slow down and speed up again). That aspect really made it hard to judge the album because I lost track with where he was going with it. Still very well written songs, with features kept to just 2 or 3.\n", "val": 0.001124473288655281}
{"text": "Fifteen years have passed since Bobby Valentino made his debut in the short-lived late 90's group Mista. While they received critical acclaim and commercial success for their 1996 self titled debut \"Mista\", they tried to follow it up with a sophomore album. Unfortunately, the album ended up being shelved and the group would part ways shortly thereafter. In the interim, Bobby laid low by going to college and getting his masters and was unheard from for the first half of the 2000's. He made his debut as a solo artist on Ludacris' 2004 album \"The Red Light District\" on the single \"Pimpin' All Over The World\". A short time later, he released his self-titled debut, \"Bobby Valentino\" in 2005. By the time he released his sophomore album \"Special Occasion\", he was cast aside for fellow Def Jam labelmates Rihanna and Ne-Yo. 2009 saw him leave Def Jam Recordings for Capitol Records to release the long winded but underrated third album \"The Rebirth\". Now, he has returned with his fourth album- and his second under Capitol- \"Fly On The Wall\", an album that is mired in his duality as a performer.On this new album, he reunites with his longtime producers Tim Kelley and Bob Robinson, who produce roughly half of the album. He also brings in producers he worked with in the past. Bryan-Michael Cox (who he worked with on \"Special Occasion\") produces the song \"Are You The Right One\". Leland \"Big Fruit\" Clopton, who also produced the song \"Beep\" from his last album produces the ballad \"Last Call For Love\". The production team The Pentagon- a spinoff from The Underdogs- turns in the first single \"Words\" as well as a cover of Bobby Brown's \"Rock Wit'cha\", and the ballad \"Hang On\". Jazze Pha produces the Plies featured \"Phone Number\" as well as \"Altered Ego\" which has an appearance from 50 Cent. While this album is listenable, it suffers from schizophrenia- from an artistic standpoint, at least. Bobby, who has long been critical of the state of present day R&B music, seems to want to play both sides of the fence. On the first half of \"Fly On The Wall\", he wants to make music that is reminiscent of the work of Babyface (See: His covers of the aforementioned \"Rock Wit'cha\" as well as \"Soon As I Get Home\" from \"Special Occasion\"). However, on the second half of the album, he ventures off into making club records, which makes him sound out place- and also making his material sound dated and rather forgettable. \"Fly On The Wall\" could be a much better album if it weren't for his internal struggle between what he wants to be versus what he is trying to be.\n", "val": 5.995008905301802e-05}

The only song that I can say I don't care for is the one with 50 Cent. I just feel that song doesn't fit in too well, but all of the others are BEAUTIFUL.

{"text": "To some R&B is dead music field in the mainstream, however there are some singers ,Eric Roberson & Kem to name a few who are still delivering classic albums. On his fourth album in his six year solo career, Bobby V (previously known as Bobby Valentino) shows his growth not only as artist vocally but his maturity as well. From wearing jeans and a t-shirt on his first album, Bobby is now rocking a suit like a grown man is supposed. The album lead by the lead single Words is ballad heavy which are where Bobby is the strongest. Longtime producers Tim & Bob contribute six songs to this project including the grown & sexy If I Can't Have while Bryan-Michael Cox gives us the concert ready Sweetness. To my surprise Bobby also covers the classic Bobby Brown song Rock Witcha to great success. There's a few songs on here which feature guest appearances from rappers 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks & Piles which came off as filler to me, but they don't take away from the strength of this album. Bobby V may not be a strong a singer as KEM or Will Downing, however with Fly On The Wall he shows that he does deserve a place in the R&B world and I look forward to his next album release.\n", "val": 0.013141736388206482}

His cover of Simple Minds classic Don't You Forget About Me isn't a bad cover, and brings in a bit more of a darker edge to the delightful #1 diddy from 1985. It was very bold for David to choose a cover song to make his next single, but honestly it is better than the oversaturated and weak cover songs that we've heard so much from the cast of Glee.

It is never out of tune,  but it is very human,  and the two singers harmonies are strange and perfectly matched.  You take a journey with the telling of the taleof some one who is most grievously tortured and killed,  only to find out at the end that...  well you'll have to listen to find out who it is.  Other songs include Every Mothers Son,  more typical in its long jam as far as Traffic goes,  the great instrumental .. which I don't have my list of songs here,, but its very swinging as well.  They show of their chops as well as their interest injazz..I think this record now more than ever would be interesting to kids who seek a more varied palette,  not only of songs but of bands themselves,  within the scope of the band...  so many just do one kind of thing.Steve Winwood is always a wonderful and incredible singer,  how does he do that?  I believe he had a background playing organ in church,  and I feel that soulful conservative youth about him no matter how old he would become.God Bless Traffic,  and don't worry about this remastering,  they did not turn anything up or down ..  just because they could.

This review is merely my opinion, and I am not pompous enough to think that my subjective tastes in music equal some sort of objective universal standard for what constitutes \"good music.\"  I have moral objections to a few songs on this album, but I know there are people who don't share my values.  Such is life!THE REVIEW: Like every other person who has ever heard Los Lonely Boys, I have eagerly been awaiting new material.  When I heard about \"Rockpango,\" I was obviously extremely excited.  I purposely avoided reading early reviews or audio spoilers, and bought the album sight unseen.  After three nearly flawless full-length studio albums, a couple of excellent live albums, and a sweet EP cover-album, I figured \"Rockpango\" was a sure-fire win.  I mean, right?Wrong.  Every band makes a clunker of an album at least once in their careers, and \"Rockpango\" is definitely a low point for Los Lonely Boys.  There are some gems on the album, but the low spots are REALLY low.The things that appealed to me about Los Lonely Boys when I heard their first album were 1) their obvious instrumental proficiency used to create a unique Texican sound, 2) their sweet harmonies, and 3) the positive message of faith, hope, and love found in nearly every song.  Essentially, they had a sweet, clean, rockin' sound that I could play anywhere I went and in any company.  I never had to worry about profanity, vulgar references, or overt sexual references popping out of my speakers when driving around with my kids, nieces, or nephews.  They sang about love and women, but always respectfully.  It was refreshing.Enter \"Rockpango.\"The album starts off in grand LLB style.  \"American Idle,\" more rock than blues, asks some mature, weighty questions about materialism and loving each other as human beings.  \"Fly Away\" continues the LLB tradition of joyful, uplifting, respectful love songs in an acoustic-heavy Texican style.  The funky \"Love In My Veins\" follows, another testament the strong love between a man and his woman.  Track #4 is \"Road to Nowhere,\" a soulful blues piece with some gorgeous orchestration, is arguably the best and most mature track on the album.So far so good.  Enter \"16 Monkeys,\" LLB's first ever tribute to the joys of using drugs and getting stoned.  The \"Higher Ground\"-esque bass line is kind of catchy, but the song ultimately sounds like a poor attempt to imitate Beck.  It was severely disappointing to hear a bunch of garbage \"day-tripper\" lyrics coming out of my speakers:\"16 monkeys on a chuck wagon rolling down the road / going round town telling everybody let's get stoned / I'm gonna take a trip to outer space because I want to, I need to / I'm seeing lots of colors / the sun's a ball of butter / and I feel good, so good / my spaceships flying / I'm an astro boy / I watched the cow jump over the moon / he said play me a song / but the notes were wrong and out of tune / I guess my cocoa puffs fell off my spoon\"Dubya. Tee. Eff?  What is this crap?!?  If I wanted to hear a bunch of garbage about how \"cool\" drugs are, I would listen to the million other loser drug-obsessed bands out there who sing about them.  Why am I hearing this on a LLB album?! Take a note, LLB: The Beatles used to make good music.  Then they learned how cool drugs were and started making steaming piles of dung in place of good music.  Don't be like The Beatles.Thankfully, the album moves on to two more great tracks.  \"Rockpango\" is a song about strength and freedom.  \"Smile\" is another innocent love song.Then the fun-train comes off the rails again with \"Baby Girl.\"  It is like someone told LLB, \"Hey, you better make a song that will get all of the bar sluts to dance.\"  I'm not going to take the time to type out all of the mind-numbingly dumb lyrics, but the listener will be treated to such deep, thoughtful lines as, \"Come on baby girl / Ima rock your world,\" and \"Oh shake it uh huh / drop it like its hot / come on touch me baby,\" or \"sugar move your hips for me / come on girl give me all your loving.\"Could you feel your brain cells dying?  *sigh* Not only are the lyrics cheesy and cliche, but the sexuality is just juvenile.  I hate to repeat my comments from above, but if I wanted to hear a song about dry humping some chick on the dance floor, I would listen to any of the million other sex-obsessed musicians/bands out there.  Why am I hearing this tripe on a LLB album?  LLB does respectful and thoughtful love songs, not bump-n-grind musical smut.Then, the album oddly goes into another deep song, \"Change The World,\" before going right back into the garbage bin with \"Porn Star.\"  \"Porn Star?\"  Really guys?  Another \"classy\" song that will never be played around respectable company or children.The album finally goes out with a whimper on the wanna-be hard rock \"Believe.\"  There is nothing really horrible about the song, the message is good, it just has a weak melody and the \"rock\" sound ends up sounding a bit garage-band-ish.So, overall, once the song about drug use is eliminated, the juvenile cliched sexual odes are fired, and the weak closer is put out of its misery, you end up with an EP's worth of 7 songs for the price of a full album. It is a shame, because if the LYRICS of \"16 Monkeys,\" \"Baby Girl,\" and \"Porn Star\" are taken away, the MUSIC behind them is really very good.I definitely won't be buying a Los Lonely Boys album \"sight unseen\" from now on.  Next time, I preview the crap out of it and buy only the tracks I like.  \"Rockpango\" = weakest Los Lonely Boys album so far.\n", "val": 0.009217089042067528}

{"text": "Been a LLB fan from before they were 'famous', but that has nothing to do with why I love this album.  There is a synergy in the vocals from the brothers Garza that I can find nowhere else.  Musicianship that is unmatched as well.  Henry is a GREAT guitar player, but Jojo and Ringo have to be about the most underrated players around.  Holy crap, just the idea that Ringo can play a set and congas at the same time is mind blowing.But this album is a left turn from their last effort.  They rock even harder than before, but the new influences add such a dimension to their journey I find it hard to explain.  For instance, 16 Monkeys and Baby Girl have a huge funk beat.  Where did that come from?The title track kicks some serious posterior.  'Love in my veins', the soaring 'Road to Nowhere', and the riffy 'Believe' are my favorite tracks.

{"text": "Combining its stark mixture of electrifying rock and roll, high-swinging solos, first  rate performing, enthralling sounds, jamming R&B, empowerment, new directions in  their music, great fun and songs that gives you hope and determination, Los Lonely  Boys delivers another blockbuster hit with this garage rock masterpiece.  Released  in 2011, Rockpango (it mean Rock Party in Spanish) would present both critics and  listeners a new and diverse form on the trademark Texican Rock as it expand upon  their roots-based rock and roll that truly defines Los Lonely Boys.  Showcased with  an exhilarating track set of new classics including American Idle, Fly Away, Love In  My Veins, 16 Monkeys (one of their more comical jams and beloved hits), the folk-  rock song Smile and the title track, this CD includes the powerful song Change The  World (not to be confused by the Eric Clapton classic) as it confronts the social and  economic troubles from the late-2000s and early-2010s, which also gives us a ray  of hope.  Also for fans of the band who happens to have children, they may want to  be cautious of the track Porn Star, which means the fans may want to be vigilant of  it (in reality, the porn industry is very dangerous, mostly corrupt, riddled with abuse  and can increase prejudice against women and homosexuals), but you will find this  entire album to be a truly highly enjoyable masterpiece while the deluxe edition will  even present you a recorded in-the-studio 24-minute Outtakes rehearsal track that  features the band clowning around and practicing, which make this the perfect buy.

I've listened to it twice and much prefer to listen to any of their other cds than this one.I understand that artists often experiment with other genres to broaden their artistic horizons, however, I miss the Tex-Mex Rock&Roll that is the basis of all their other cds.  I applaud their attempt to try something new but am not enthused with their current offering.  I hope they find a better musical path next time but I believe this effort somehow got lost in the confusion of different styles.In my opinion, you'd do better to get their \"Heaven\" or \"Forgiven\" cds, or one of my personal favorites, the acoustic \"Keep on Giving\".\n", "val": 7.281095167854801e-05}

Some of the songs on this CD were just lame and we were very disappointed by the sex and drug themed lyrics on this album. There's enough of that out there already and we appreciated the lack of it on previous CDs. These guys are great musicians and are fun to see perform.We were really looking forward to the 2011 tour through our area. Our kids have grown to love LLB like us and this year we were going to take them to the show. After hearing this CD, my wife and I lost all enthusiasm about the show; we just never brought it up to each other, we just didn't go and never mentioned it. 6 ticket sales lost, not to mention future shows. I wish I hadn't wasted money on the CD, but I'm glad we heard it before we spent $220 on the show! Having been such big fans, we were almost embarrassed for the band.Look, I know that bands make bad CDs, but the drug/sex songs were a surprise to us. Yes, we can not listen to this CD. But unfortunately, they'll probably play this stuff in future shows for years to come, so we may not be going. I'm not sure if we even care about future albums at this point, but maybe they'll get better in the future.

Call me a prude, but the lyrics are a little bit in the \"too much information\" category for me on the love songs.  I don't really want to hear all about what part of someone's anatomy they want to put where or what kind of body parts are someone's turn-on - that seems like a private matter to me.

{"text": "Was this review helpful?  I hope that it will be for new fans of Los Lonely Boys and old fans who have not yet purchased ROCKPANGO.  As mentioned in other reviews, this is Los Lonely Boys 1st CD released under their label Lonely Tone/Playing in Traffic Records and the 4th studio recorded CD.  It is my opinion that Los Lonely Boys has stayed true to who they are.  Henry, JoJo and Ringo are not boys ... they are mature young men now, who have experienced life on all different levels.  Their journey is reflected in this CD (regular and enhanced).  While the track titles and lyrics may have thrown some reviewers for a loop (I don't get it but they have the right to their opinions) - you cannot deny the talent that these brothers from San Angelo, Texas have.  Remember people these are 3 musicians who produce a HUGE sound with their respective instruments - although they do have guest appearances by:  it doesn't dismiss the fact that they are the master engineers behind the drive and direction on this CD.  There is something on ROCKPANGO for everyone.  You have Latin inspired beats, Santana, Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan influences, guest appearances: Riley Osbourn, Carmelo Torres, DJ Beans scratching, Rap from Kush, Carrie Rodriguez - lead violin and the Tosca Strings.  Remove the lyrics from the tracks and the music and arrangements will still \"rock my world\".So let's talk about the lyrics.  The 11 tracks (plus 2 bonus tracks) found on these 2 CDs are songs that speak of lost love, found love, and lasting love and are as raw and as real as you can get.  They're songs of taking a stand in changing the world, enjoying life, reflecting on childhood games and fantasy and having a life party. Now what I really do love about the lyrics is that these Texican brothers have brought back their Spanlish phrasing.  Who will deny that the Spanish language is sexy or can be sexy?  When Hispanic men really dig a woman, he refers to her as his Ruca, Chula, Mamacita or what? \"Baby Girl\".  That's relating to young people today - get it?  I'd like to see Dancing with the Stars use this song for a Salsa or Rumba.  Anyway, I remember the days of being called \"ole lady\" when I was 23 years old.  Did I consider that an insult to me as a woman, nope - I didn't?  Ok I'm not speaking for all the women of the world or those who may be offended - that's just me.  If you listen to the lyrics of \"Porn Star\" - it is clearly a love song and a love-fest of funk. If PORN were changed to MOVIE - would the message of a risky love still be the same?  Just my take on those 2 songs and I personally think they are HOT!The vocals are tight, beautiful, and harmonious and are pure honey. I can't help but be moved by \"Fly Away\", \"Road to Nowhere\", and \"Change the World\".  I would recommend having a box of tissues available when listening to \"Smile\" (and :Smile .2\")  The strings, piano and JoJo's vocals are a beautiful tender collaboration and I would bet this song will be played at someone's wedding.  Each brother has their turn on lead vocals and they all do a fabulous job in that aspect.  Ringo's lead vocals on \"Believe\" are right on.  I can't wait to hear that one live if not only for the rarity of him singing lead but also for the driving, rock appeal this song has.\"American Idle\" and \"Love in My Veins\" are rocking tunes and the lyrics are catchy.  American Idle speaks of world politics and how you can help change it.  Wouldn't be surprised if you be started singing along before either of these song is over.Rockpango is definitely a Rock Party and reminds me of the fabulous ONDA.  Judgment Day is bound to be a favorite of any Stevie Ray Vaughan fan.  I do love the lyrics on this track especially: don't think you can judge me we all have our selfish ways.  There is so much truth in that.  \"16 Monkeys\" - its Funk and Fun with an Austin Powers flavor (yeah, baby) - and don't even touch those bass riffs - they make me want to jump on that chuck wagon.ROCKPANGO has everything a Los Lonely Boys fan could ask for and has perfect examples of their burrito theory SUPER sized. I appreciate the chance to share my views on ROCKPANGO and respect the opinions of others who have taken the time to post here.  I give it 5 stars.  That's my review, a 54 year old woman who digs Los Lonely Boys and whose music touches my heart and soul and makes me dance like a 21 year old and rock out like a teenager.  ... The end!\n", "val": 0.004391091875731945}

{"text": "I've been on these boys' bandwagon since before their first hit, even back when I was enjoying their music and not knowing who they were -- so I am slightly biased when it comes to reviewing any new offering. But something I've pleasantly discovered over the years is that they never fail to surprise me. Rockpango is that rare jewel that is pure, unadulterated great sound. Maybe it's the fact that this is their very first 'solo' on their own label, Lonely Tone Records --- flying free without the studio bigshots pointing at what they should do and how they should sound. You can hear the control, the joy, the originality; yet it maintains a prominent tribute to all the greats that they will tell you happily they look up to and honor. I can't pick a favorite on this CD. They all have breadth and depth in spades, fun and funk to spare. But the Texican style -- uniquely LOS LONELY BOYS, is still here on this album. They don't need to be compared to anyone else. They have shown that they are their own band, have talent in buckets, and are not going away! If you can see them live, do it. But, in the meantime, go buy this. You're in for a ride -- a ROCKIN' ride!\n", "val": 0.03713344410061836}

I've been a long time fan of Los Lobos and these guys try too hard to imitate. Sorry, but not even close. Los Lobos was a class act and produced some of the finest Tex Mex Music of 70's & 80's.

With Rockpango my enthusiasm has been renewed. What a great piece of work from the Boys. Yes it has some tunes that are different and that, for me, is exactly what was needed. I have seen LLB several times now and they never fail to give a GREAT show. If you have the chance do yourself a favor and see them, I will be seeing them once again in a few months.

{"text": "Been missing Los Lonely Boys?Forgiven and the two new songs on Christmas Spirit feel like a lifetime ago, particularly since 1969 is \"in the way\".  Not that it is bad, but it is not original material.Rockpango rolls us back to some of the musical magic of the first album - that would be Los Lonely Boys (Or Music 2003 / Epic 2004) - while showing some musical growth.New elements?  Sure.  16 Monkeys, Baby Girl and Porn Star may be ... confusing ... to those who have followed the boys for a while as well as new listeners.  There's a consistent criticism that LLB's music is shallow and juvenile.  Not so any more, at least if your measure is more ... mature ... themes.  Different isn't necessarily bad, just different.Consistent aspects?  Also \"sure\".  Latin rhythms and Spanish on the fly are back and strong.  There's an acoustic song, plus ballads.  Pretty wide take on musical styles.  And mostly our expected topics.In no particular order:Rockpango has been used as a show encore on and off for the past year, so many are familiar with this song.Fly Away is, of course, the first single, and is in rotation as I write this.The rest of the album is a smorgasbord, and not too well exposed to the public just yet.Traditional LLB:  Fly Away.Slow and soulful:  Road To Nowhere.  Smile.In your face rockers:  Rockpango.  Believe.  Love In My Veins.Thoughtful:  Change the World.  American Idle.A bit...crazy:  16 Monkeys (laughed at the apt description by another reviewer \"day tripper lyrics\".Outside the normal LLB boundaries:  Porn Star.  Baby Girl.LLB has never been able to be fit into a genre box.  So it remains inappropriate to try to box this album.  Take it at face value:  three young men, with some assistance, making a new, full album of their \"Texican\" music.  For which I am thankful, and of which I am proud - for them.  Viva LLB!  PS:  I am and remain a rabid LLB fan.  That's your free grain of salt for my review.By all means, see Los Lonely Boys perform live; but the album will keep you between shows!  Orale'!\n", "val": 0.0002749348059296608}
{"text": "The little sticky label on the cover says \"First CD of all new material in over three years!\"The absolute truth.  From the original 1997 \"Los Lonely Boys\" (yes, there was...) to the 2000 \"Live At Blue Cat Blues\" to the 2003 \"Los Lonely Boys\" took some time too.  Then Live At The Fillmore.  Sacred.  Forgiven.  Christmas Spirit.  1969.  Keep On Giving.  And now, finally, another full album of new material.There's obviously time and care invested in this album.  Those wonderfully deep and thoughtful lyrics are sprinkled throughout, but also some musical ... growth ... as the boys try out some new tricks.And for those of you who missed the switch-on-the-fly English to Spanish, well...it's back!  As is quite a bit of Latin rhythm!Of additional special note - the second LLB album on the Playing In Traffic Records label and LLB's Lonely Tone imprint.In track list order:American Idle:  A gritty rocker that takes issue with the fact that \"Everybody knows you gotta make a dollar just to get along...\"Fly Away:  Picked as the first single, this catchy acoustic piece will have you wiggling in your seat!Love In My Veins:  \"I need your love...I need you in my veins.\"  Perhaps predictable lyrics, but the boys have a good time bringing us yet another pass at those words, plus some great guitar work by Henry.Road To Nowhere:  One of those painful country-inspired songs that the boys are so good at.  \"Dressed\" with a bit of strings, you'll find some pretty vocal work as well.16 Monkeys:  A big, unexpected departure from the songs we've been given by LLB up to now.  When I first heard it, I thought the boys had been spinning Mike Nesmith's \"Eldorado To The Moon\" or something similar.  Funny...almost to the point of bizarre in some places.  The verse that picks up \"Batman\" for example.Rockpango:  This one has been performed as the encore at shows for the past year or so, as well as on Jay Leno on 3/28/2011.  Hits like a punch in the nose, hard from the first note...\"You'll find out life ain't fair - don't get mad.\"Smile:  Soulful.  I think this one was written by Jojo (although all three are always credited), and certainly he's singing the lead on this pretty, pretty piece!Baby Girl:  Unexpected.  This one should be put into airplay in the Hispanic radio markets, where I'd expect it to take off right straight up.Change The World:  A reminder that we all have the power to make this a different place to live.Porn Star:  The title may put some folks off, and there's some unexpected lyrics.  If you have very young fans, you might want to give it a listen before handing it over to them.  It really is a true-love song - about accepting someone regardless of their foibles or circumstance.Believe:  \"They call me crazy...cuz I believe in love.\"  Another novel approach, sine we don't normally get something this ... hard-rock ... from the boys.Judgment Day:  Let's not hide it.  You'll swear it is a Stevie Ray Vaughn song, but it is pure LLB.Smile. 2:  A slightly different arrangement of the same song, piano and strings, both prettier and more pain-filled than the other version on this album - if that's possible.Outtakes:  Good for a bunch of laughs as the boys cut up at the mike during the recording sessions.  Some Huey Lewis, Ghostbusters, and other tidbits that came to mind as they were hard at work.Plus four videos:  Free Spirit, Coke In Chicago, Boxing and Warm Up, and a fold out poster, making this a great gift value!This is a really strong album that showcases all the things we've come to love in LLB's music - great vocals and harmonies as well as great musicianship!\n", "val": 0.011642939411103725}
{"text": "This is a fantastic album. Yes, it does go out in some different directions from past LLB albums. But it should. What I love about LLB is the fact that like say the Beatles , they do evolve from album to album while retaining a personality and sound very much their own. Who wants to hear bands make the same freaking album over and over again (ahem...AC/DC, etc ).  Influences on this album range from Michael Jackson to Stevie Wonder and Beck with all manner of blues, rock and funk in between. For those who rate this ablum low simply for the mild sex and drug references ...two words... grow up. The things they say in this album....the sexually is just innuendo basically ,and the drugs lyric is in the context of an obviously tongue in cheek song. I also take issue with those griping about the song writing. There is some very well constructed ,musically interesting, quite catchy material here. LLB have delivered another great album well in line with their evolution as musicians and songwriters.\n", "val": 0.030572716146707535}

Kevin's vocals are INCREDIBLE and so unique!!  James may be one of rock's BEST new guitarists and his vocal harmonies with Kevin are SPOT ON.  Jason is an AMAZING percussionist and Wes adds the perfect deep end to complete the HUGE TRUSTcompany sound!!

{"text": "I've been a fan of Trust Company since the day True Parallels came out six years ago, that album blew me away. I personally think this is a must have album, if you like this kind of music. Trust Company is back, I've been waiting a long time for this album to be released. I was really sad when they broke up, because I love their music, and Trust Company is one of my favorite bands. Then Kevin formed Amity Lane, and they released one album, which was alright, and now Trust Company got back together to release a new album, which is great. When I found out they were releasing a new album I couldn't wait, but this album was worth the long wait. I love Trust Company support them by buying this album, and not downloading it. Trust Company needs to be known, because Trust Company makes great music. You don't have to be mainstream to be popular, and to make great music. This album sounds nothing like their previous albums. I personally think Trust Company has evolved on this album. Kevin's voice is so amazing, you can listen to any of their albums on repeat for hours, and not get tired of them. This album will defiantly be in my top favorite 10 albums of 2011, and may make it into my top favorite 40 albums ever. Trust Company keep up the good work, and please stay around forever. My favorite songs on this album are:1. Heart in My Hands2. Alone Again3. Letting Go4. Dreaming in Black and White5. Don't Say Goodbye\n", "val": 0.021657386794686317}

Sadly, things didn't pan out so well in the years to come. 2005 saw the release of their second album, \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/True-Parallels/dp/B0007TKHX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">True Parallels</a>,\" after being shelved by the label for a year. The album was more or less dumped into stores with little to no support. As a result, TRUSTcompany went quietly into that good night later that year. A few years went by, and after cooler heads prevailed, the band reunited in 2007, self-funded and without the burden of a major label. The fruit of their reunion, the long-awaited \"Dreaming in Black and White,\" finds the band barely missing a beat.The first thing you'll notice upon listening to this album is just how good it sounds. The production (done by Chuck Alzakian) is top-notch and truly captures the spirit of the band. If any criticism could be laid on either of the previous albums, it's that they were a bit overproduced and homogenized. For the first time, TRUSTcompany sound exactly as they should, with the dual fret-work of James Fukai and frontman Kevin Palmer at the forefront supported by a bombastic rhythm section (including yet another new bassist, Wes Cobb) that will no doubt dominate the most expensive and elaborate soundsystems as well as the cheapest and tiniest earbuds. To put it bluntly, this is the first TRUSTcompany record with testosterone.The album opens with the rocking \"Close Your Eyes (`til it's Over)\" which is 100% pure TRUSTcompany. Everything that made the band who they were remains intact and they have never sounded this fresh and energized. Later cuts such as \"Reverse and Remember\" and \"Almost There\" - the latter of which features an uncharacteristic but utterly cool guitar solo - expand upon what's already been heard while still staying true to the band's core sound. The title track along with the album's first single, \"Heart in My Hands,\" are the obvious singles without being too obvious in their composition. Here we have classic TRUSTcompany tracks that show the band hasn't lost their edge creatively or commercially. Unfortunately, the album falls short of perfection with the inclusion of a few duds. The band's tendency to dip into sappy power-ballad cheese the likes of \"Letting Go\" and \"Alone Again\" doesn't do their comeback any favors and sound like the sort of stuff the band's previous label would have forced their hand in writing. These moments would surely have been better left on the cutting room floor and the album as a whole would have been the better for it.Aside from a few minor kinks, \"Dreaming in Black and White\" is a solid and successful comeback from a band that always deserved better. Those who remember the band circa 2002 will be happy to find that they still sound great after all these years, while those who have spun the band's two previous records to death will find just enough variety and variation to make this third effort worthwhile. Even though it falls short of perfection, TRUSTcompany's third album proves the old adage that the third time is the charm. \"Dreaming in Black and White\" is without a doubt the band's finest album to date and with enough push, will do well to reinstate the band as the premier sensitive-guy hard-rock outfit. Here's hoping it won't be another 5-6 years before we hear new music from the band.\n", "val": 0.004091382957994938}

True Parallels is one of my favorite albums so it was only natural to wonder if Trust Company could duplicate or surpass their previous album after so many years. Fans will not be disappointed in the slightest. They hit all the high marks that they did 6 years ago and may have even succeeded in raising the bar. The album sounds great first of all, and I mean the actual sound quality. I've seen other reviewers compliment the production work and I whole heatedly agree. The entire album fires on all cylinders throughout and I don't feel like the energy and verve of the instrumentals or the soaring vocals falter on any song here.

The sound is very similar to previous albums but maybe a bit more mature.  Don't expect some radically different approach to their music though...this is all-out TRUSTCompany.  Songs like Close Your Eyes (Til It's Over), Heart In My Hands, Dreaming In Black and White, and my personal favorites Skies Will Burn and Reverse and Remember will all get your blood pumping with a great rock sound that only TRUSTCompany has.  Then you have some slower choices like Stumbling, Alone Again, and Don't Say Goodbye (Awesome!) to balance the album out.  Personally I prefer the rockier side and I wish Dreaming In Black and White had one less slow song and one more hard song, but that's my only criticism.  I'm lucky enough to have seen TRUSTCompany perform live a couple of times and have also met them and they are a great group of guys.  They are so underrated and need more support!

{"text": "Bruce has been in a slump for a while, both in quality and quantity of new music. Of course we have been spoiled for a long time. The first 20 years of Bruce's career he released 15 studio albums and in my opinion every one of them was pretty great. Over the past 12 years before this new release Bruce put out just 2 new studio cd's; I thought they were the 2 worst albums of all his work (although I liked a few songs off of You've Never Seen Everything).So I had some trepidation when I listened to Small Source Of Comfort for the first time. I was happy to hear that Bruce is back creating some of the great music that we have come to expect over the last 4 decades. Bruce opens up with the catchiest tune on the cd \"Iris Of The World\" - an infectious song that has some great Bruce wordplay. It is a unique Bruce travelogue, a modern day \"How I Spent My Fall Vacation\".Next is \"Call Me Rose\", the single from SSOC. The song, if you can believe it, is written from the viewpoint of Richard Nixon who has been reincarnated in the body of a single mother living in the projects. From the description I pictured a novelty track that I would probably listen to a few times and have no desire to put on again. I find myself really liking this song. Bruce captures a feeling of resignation and perhaps even a chance at redemption (maybe Richard Nixon wishes this song was true). That's the other thing I like about this cd. Bruce seemingly has laid aside the anger that in my opinion marred some of the songs on the last 2 cd's. Not to say he doesn't address some issues here; It is not an album that ignores the state of the world. He just seems to be a little bit more at peace with himself.I won't go into each track but the overall feel of the album is acoustic, yet often rhythmic. The songs stand up to repeated listening. Bruce's voice, one of his greatest gifts, is beautiful - deep and resonant. And the lyrics are often beautiful. The production goes well with the material unlike the overproduced Life Short Call Now.I personally could do without 5 instrumentals. 1 or 2 would suffice for me. They are quality songs and Bruce plays them beautifully. You may disagree. But nothing is lost since there are 14 songs total.The last song \"Gifts\" was written in 1968. It is a gorgeous short poem (perhaps prayer) set to music. Bruce's manager wanted him to record it for his first album. Bruce said he would rather record it for his last. At almost 66 years old we never know when the last album will be. As Bruce said once, \"Everything that exists in time runs out of time one day\". Whenever it ends he certainly will have left behind a vast amount of wonderful music.\n", "val": 0.00798962265253067}

I'm not going to spend much time knocking it down--just trying to balance out the reviews a bit.If you are new to Bruce and want to know what to buy, just about anything from Stealing Fire to Speechless would be a good choice. Although there are many gems to be found (like Arrows of Light, performed on a dulcimer in the current tour), his early stuff is dated and not as accessible as, say, early Dylan. In hindsight, it seems his trip to Central America, resulting in Stealing Fire, 'opened him up' quite a bit and marks the beginning of his songwriting maturity (the four albums before that perhaps show the beginnings of what was about to happen).But, even tho the 'Small Source of Comfort Tour' is superb, the album by the same name is not\n", "val": 3.5692974051926285e-05}
{"text": "Small Source of Comfort is the worst Bruce Cockburn music ever!  Bruce Cockburn has not done it for me over the last several years.  His early work (up through \"Circles In The Stream\") has a sort of innocence to it.  It was filled with spiritual wonder and well crafted lyrics - poetic and insightful.  I lost interest from \"Circles\" until \"Stealing fire\" and \"World of Wonders\".  The CD \"Big Circumstance\" seemed to go back into his heavy political activism views.  His live CD was okay, but nothing like his first live CD \"Circles in the Stream\".  Then a jewel came along reviving Bruce as fresh and insightful again with \"Nothing but a burning light\".  Then came along a nice Christmas CD filled with unique arrangements, and then \"Dart to the Heart\". \"Nothing\" and \"Dart\" were fantastic.  Bruce seemed to back away from his political BS and back into spiritual songs, insightful lyrics, and songs filled with real meaning.  Bruce was back.  Then came Charity.  A pretty good CD but lacking a bit from \"Nothing\" & \"Dart\".  Then it went downhill.  \"Breakfast\" and \"You've never seen everything\" were musically good, but lyrically lackluster.  Kind of dull.  Then it got worse.  \"Life short\" was a dissapointment and a CD rarely listend to at all.  I thought it could not get any worse until \"Small source of comfort\" came out.  This is the first CD that is total trash and worthless.  Bruce has lost his mind, is alienating most everyone and appealing to the liberal left to the maximum.  Sometime I did not agree with some of Bruce's songs but I could undersand was coming from, or his view point.  I am open to other opnions and with music, you certainly have to be.  However, with \"Small source of comfort\" instead of love, spiritual, and political; the listener gets ALL political mumbo jumbo.  Yuck.  The music is not as good, Bruce's voice is not as strong, and most disappointing is the lyrical content.  The songs have no passion or insightful meaning, just quotable hate and low tolerance for anything other than those who preach tolerance but are the least tolerant of all.  I used to really enjoy Bruce Cockburn.  Wonder if the spiritual side will reawaken sometime in the near future?  Who knows, but \"Small Source of Comfort\" is awful.  I really tried to give it a fair shake by using the test of time.  I could not even listen to it when I got it so I put it away for a year and tried it again.  No such luck, it is just as awful today as when I first recevied it.  Can Bruce produce something worthy of listening to again?  He is so far left now that I do not know if he can pull himself back into some sort of normalcy.  Then again, I guess that is the trouble with the normal and I will just be waiting on a miracle.

{"text": "I must start off by saying that Bruce is one of my all-time favorite musicians. Having said that, it's time to finally face the fact Bruce's decline is now official with Small Source of Comfort. Bruce peaked with 1996's Charity of Night. It would be impossible for any artist to follow up with an album of such magnitude. 1999's Breakfast In New Orleans...was a very good follow up to Charity but it ceratinly lacked the brilliance of Charity. This was to be expected considering in hindsight that Bruce peaked with Charity of Night.Excluding a series of live and compilation albums since then, Bruce's last three proper albums have been overall duds. Sure there have been some song-gems here and there such as \"Celestial Horses\", \"Life Short Call Now\", \"Different When It Comes to You\", and \"Mystery\". But for full length albums with 12-14 songs, there just has not been enough quality material on these albums.Ever since 2003's You've Never Seen Everything, Bruce seems to have forsaken songs with amazing hooks. There are hardly any songs that stick in your head that you can hum without even hearing them played. This is even more evident on the new album Small Source of Comfort. To put it simply, Bruce no longer writes songs in which you can sing along with anymore. As an artist, maybe his jazzy noodlings and vocal stylings are more satisfying. As a listener, they aren't. I keep looking forward to each new release, but ultimately they have been disappointments.Bruce has released three new albums since Breakfast...I have given each album the benefit of doubt. With Small Source of Comfort, it's finally time to admit that the downward slide is complete. Bruce 2000's work does not hold up well against his very late 70's, 80's, and 90's material. Those were the golden years and they have come to an end no matter how much we force ourselves to enjoy the new material. Repeated listenings just don't help. I'm tired of trying to learn to like these albums.Giving Small Source of Comfort 5 stars devalues albums like Charity of Night, Humans, Call It Democracy, and Stealing Fire. What could you possibly rate those albums on a 5 star system? Is Small Source really even close to the quality of those albums?\n", "val": 6.545874930452555e-05}

I still believe that those three albums are his peak and only get better with age. The arc that started with Sunwheel Dance through Big Circumstance are simply an awesome collection music let alone that of one artist.Let's cut Bruce some slack.  He's been making difficult music for forty plus years.  I would never assume that he even considers pleasing everyone nor cares.  Every single album of his career (and I do own all of the U.S. & Canadian releases since his debut) has its individual charms.Back to Small Source of Comfort.  No, it does not stand up to those amazing 70's & 80's releases.  While that may be true, I enjoy this entire album.  The one universal thing that stands out is that is really has elements of all phases of his career.  Acoustic instrumentals, cynical humor, political jabs, human reality.At 66 Bruce may also be contemplating stopping the craziness and walking away.

The intensity of Mr. Cockburn's passion for political justice and human rights, and his interest in human relationships, nature, and spirituality continue unabated as themes in songs from his fine new album, \"small source of comfort\".  Mr. Cockburn has engendered an abiding and fierce loyalty among his fans in a career spanning many decades because of this.  He is an artist who has that rare ability to connect with his audience on a personal level.  On this album, his songs continue to tug at our conscience and hearts and are, indeed, a source of comfort as the title suggests.Other reviewers have contended that the melodies on this album do not have the immediacy of his earlier work.  Yet listen to the songs a few times and they will grow on you; for the patient and intelligent listener there are substantial rewards to be had.  He continues to be a lyrical craftsman, and is among the finer acoustic guitarists on the planet.

{"text": "At sixty-five years of age and with a musical career that stretches way back to 1968, does Bruce Cockburn still have something to offer? With the new release Small Source of Comfort the answer is a resounding yes. Cockburn has assembled 14 tracks here including 5 dazzling instrumentals and it's all fine stuff. I must admit that the last two studio efforts Life Short Call Now and especially You've Never Seen Anything were good, but not great. Despite that Cockburn claims in the liner notes that he was planning a \"noise\" album, Small Source of Comfort finds Bruce in, well, his comfort zone. Bohemian Three-Step and Lois On the Autobahn are particularly excellent instrumentals, while The Iris of the World, Call Me Rose, Driving Away and the Gifts (and old Cockburn song written in the '60s) are terrific singer/songwriter tracks. The musical accompaniment by the likes of violinist Jenny Scheinman and percussionist Gary Craig is brilliant. Scheinman who also handles back-up vocals, co-wrote some of the more beautiful songs. Colin Linden's recording and production work are stellar as usual. In my opinion, Bruce Cockburn's very best work is behind him. How can you beat albums like Humans, Dancing in The Dragon Jaws, and the earlier masterpieces like Sunwheel Dance and Night Vision? Still, all in all, kudos to Cockburn for staying in the game and giving lovers of his music another album to treasure.\n", "val": 0.048074256628751755}

{"text": "Others have said it in their own amazon reviews -- Bruce does not approach the grandeur of the musical and lyrical feats of his younger days. So many classical composers got better, deeper, richer as they grew older. I do not understand why the same is rarely the case for pop musicians.My best friend (a longtime Cockburn fan who went to some lengths to see him live last year, and was very pleased) told me it was an effort for him to get through this album. I did not find that to be so. I actually found it a pleasant listen. Track one is bouncy and witty, though not soaringly poetic. While not actually joyful, it is upbeat or happily ironic at least. It's as if Cockburn has learned to laugh again -- he seemed so dire there for a time. The second song does not impress me musically, and \"It's not what I would have chose\" sounds like rather clunky syntax, but at least there's a playfulness about it.If the songs on Small Source Of Comfort really must be heard ten times to appreciate, then I'm afraid I will never know their full goodness. After nearly four decades of critical music listening, I think I can latch on to what is good and bad about most songs very quickly. Repeated listens merely remind me of those successes and flaws I heard the first time. I would love to report that Cockburn is back in full force here, but it doesn't seem that way to me. I'll go back to the old albums.If you desperately need a fix of new Cockburn, this is it. His voice has held up extremely well, his guitar playing is as nimble as ever, he sings about the topics he's always been singing about. I'll just say that I prefer his material from six albums on either side of Dancing In the Dragons Jaws and leave it at that.\n", "val": 0.010928832925856113}

But I've learned to keep listening.On Small Source of Comfort the first two tunes are pretty catchy, Call me Rose stuck in my head for a couple of days. But I am very attracted to Boundless and Each One Lost. Again Cockburn does things different, not doing it the same as previous albums. And yet there is a depth and honesty which continue through everything he does. He cares about his music, cares about what he is saying, and works to get the music/message/art out there. He actually does have a lot to say.During the W years, he put out an album called \"Speechless\". It was all instrumental. He's good that that, sometimes amazing. But the title made sense to me, in the face of needless war and a world going into an environmental spiral down, what else was there to say? Well he did follow that up with \"Life Short, Call Now,\" an album held together by a trumpet and the sense that while this life is full of murderous hypocrisy, there still remains a mystery that gives hope.Then, with Small Source, the album feels like it is sort of the rubble at the end of a career. Beautiful rubble, but still, threads of ideas from a whole variety of sources. They don't seem to connect to each other, as beautiful and mature as each one might be alone. The last song does tie it together. It's an old song that I hear he would hold for his last album. I hope not.\n", "val": 0.0027153189294040203}

{"text": "This one takes a few listens. For me, it was the Tibetan percussion, the subtle influences that whispered a piety of thinking that have won me over for this record, and in that regard, this one reminds me very much of his early work. In his self-deprecating liner notes, Cockburn states he had in mind a noisy project, an index of Canadian metals perhaps, and came up with this. Some index, eh? The instrumentals all play to his strengths and his influences and remind you also just what an amazing luthier Linda Manzer is. If you can not abide 5 instrumentals, more's the pity. Justin Bieber may be just your ticket. The guitar sounds great on this record. His sense of humour on Called Me Back, his genuine compassion and sorrow on Each One Lost, and his sense of the impermanence, even of love, on The Iris Of The World ring with heart breaking authority. They cut to the chase with humour, sadness and intimacy with a genuine urgency, a sese that time is short, call now.This disc is a departure from records like You've Never Seen Everything, Call Now, even the Slice o Life and Speechless releases. There is a feel to it that reminds me more of the period from Sun Wheel Dance through Circles In The Stream and would fit right in, but for a few historical references, with that trajectory. In a sense then, while he isn't going back, he is returning to something from a different stream than he's waded through in a while. His collaborators in this project are all terrific, notably Colin Linden and Jenny Scheinman. It would be great were he to tour with a band with these folks on board.Note to Bruce: Songs about Richard Nixon are too late in 2011. And it's off the mark anyway. I used to bump into Richard, walking around Daylesford on a visit to his daughter. Inspite of the continued SS presence, I found him approachable, forthcoming about his own character flaws that brought him down, in short, maybe more Shakespearean than Shakespeare could have imagined. He certainly had a sense that he'd re-written Lear and RIII. Not exactly the clueless power monger in Rose. I think Neil got it right, \"even RN has got it - soul.\" Now, Reagan on the other hand... there karma kicked in.

{"text": "This music is supposedly for relaxation but if I had to listen to it for long I'd go crazy.  Its not just repetitious and boring, it's so un-melodical and tuneless that it's really distracting.  I downloaded it all to listen in the background while I did some office work, and each song where the flute popped in for another pointless bleat caught my attention, not in a good way.  I ended up keeping two songs - Monsoon Lullaby and Tibetan Morning - but I'm already sick of the hokey sitar part on Monsoon Lullaby so that's probably going to get deleted as well.  Not worth the price, even if it is free.Show some respect for music, folks.  There's plenty of real music (world, western classical, and even new age) which is suitable for relaxation and meditation without creating this fake kind of \"music for massage and yoga\".\n", "val": 3.640684735728428e-05}

{"text": "Looking for some meditative, relaxing, concentration-enhancing and/or sleep-inducing music? That's what the 14 tracks in this free collection were designed for. But beware: the monotonous, non-melodic style of music presented here isn't for everyone.All of the tracks in the collection show signs of being inspired by meditative Indian or Tibetan music, and this is particularly evident in the tracks boasting sitars (tracks 3, 6, 10, and 13) and Tibetan singing bowls (2, 5, 9). The most common instrument, however, was a Native American flute (1, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14), while synthesizers (2, 5, 12, 14) and animal sounds (1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12) were used to add atmosphere to several tracks. The tempo and mood varied somewhat across the tracks, from the airy and mellow \"Early Evening Breeze\" (flute over crickets, bird song, chimes, and light gongs); to the droning, contemplative, and almost ominous \"Removing Negative Energy\" (tolling Tibetan bells over synthesizers); and the moderately paced and almost-tense \"Purify\" (flute over driving drums, with sitar and chimes). The most musical (in the Western sense) tracks are \"Bombay to Santa Fe\" and \"Monsoon Lullaby\", both of which feature an almost-tuneful fingerpicked guitar over a quietly droning sitar.The contrasts in style and instrumentation across the 14 tracks are not large, and this should not be surprising given that all of the tracks were recorded by either \"Yoga Tribe\" or \"Massage Tribe\". Nevertheless, this feels more like an ad hoc collection than a coherent album; it makes more sense to put a single track on a loop than to listen to the thing as a whole. Unfortunately, none of the tracks are very long; they range from 1 to 6 minutes. Several of them fade out, however, suggesting that longer versions exist somewhere.If you've been to a yoga class, you've heard this sort of music before. If you ever felt like taking the yoga teacher's music home with you, this collection is for you. If you've never been to a yoga class, you may still find one or more tracks in this collection to be soothing and relaxing. Since it's free, you might as well give it a try.\n", "val": 9.143912757281214e-05}

{"text": "Halestorm is rapidly becoming one of my favorite bands.  I listen to a lot of female rock and I still have to tell you that Lzzy Hale rocks it more than any other artist I know.  It is obvious that the band had so much fun with this album.  From Lady Gaga to The Beatles, they get in a remarkable amount of variety within a 6-song EP.  The whole thing is, of course, carried by Lzzy's insanely powerful voice (not sure if this EP would be much out of the ordinary without it).  She can scream like the best of male singers.  At the same time, she can sing softly and sweetly (\"All I Want to do is Make Love to You\").  My favorite song on this EP has to be \"Bad Romance\" if only because there is something incredibly enjoyable about hearing the metal version (I am not a Lady Gaga fan).  I also love the tip off to Heart since Halestorm was obviously heavily influenced by Heart.I haven't heard anything bad by Halestorm yet and I am eagerly awaiting their next album.  I'm sure it will rock.\n", "val": 0.05916571244597435}
{"text": "All right, here's how it goes. When I saw that in this short album one of the covers was going to be a lady gaga cover, I was hesitant. That is, until I saw them live and heard it before this album even came out, but that's another story. Since I got this album three days ago I have done nothing but listen to it. All the covers were picked with precision and executed to perfection. Lzzy owns the vocals on every song especially Hunger Strike and the band takes all the music and makes it their own in a way I haven't heard for a long time. The only issue I have with it is that it isn't long enough. I would have loved a full length album of covers from these guys but, what can you do? If you are looking for a great rock album, don't only check out this album but their other two as well or if you just want good listening music, this is the album for you. It should not be passed up particularly with a six dollar price tag. I highly recomend that you buy this.\n", "val": 0.007999293506145477}

{"text": "I just discovered Halestorm a few days ago from a song of theirs that came up on my Black Stone Cherry Pandora station. Lzzy Hale has one of the best voices, and easily the best female voice, I've heard. Their covers on this CD are excellent. My two favorites are Out Ta Get Me and Bad Romance. Ou Ta Get Me is a Guns 'n' Roses song I had never heard before (I enjoy rock 'n' roll but unfortunately have never extensively listend to Guns 'n' Roses), and after looking the original up, I'd consider Halestorm's version slightly better than Guns 'n' Roses original version. I also greatly enjoyed their version of Bad Romance (as my title probably suggests), though the live version is better than the CD version in my opinion. I never listened to Lady Gaga's version before (I don't listen to pop music), and when I looked it up I could barely stand to listen for more than a few seconds at a time. Lady Gaga's original version is almost painful, while Halestorm's version of Bad Romance I could jam out to.I also can't wait for their Reanimate 2.0 coming out October 15, though I'm a bit worried about Shoot To Thrill by AC/DC since AC/DC's my favorite band. I've listened to their version of You Shook Me All Night Long, and while Lzzy Hale sang it excellently (and I was also surprised she kept the original lyrics - I've briefly listened to a few rather bad renditions by more pop-oriented female singers that changed all \"her\"s and \"she\"s to \"him\"s and \"he\"s), I very much disliked the fact it was an acoustic version. I felt it was rather disrespectful of AC/DC to play an acoustic version...AC/DC songs should be on electric guitars, in my opinion. However, hopefully Shoot To Thrill is a non-acoustic version, and I'm sure Lzzy Hale will ace the singing of it. I've listened to their version of Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky\" from Reanimate 2.0 on YouTube (since it was released early), and greatly enjoyed that one, so hopefully the rest will be great, too.Rock on, Halestorm!\n", "val": 0.012024354189634323}

{"text": "Capitol Records shows with this release that they are capable of compiling an excellent single CD compilation of Great White.  To be sure, this is only the 3rd CD anthology from Capitol and by far the best.  There are many other releases on other labels that do not include these original studio versions, but rather re-recorded or live versions and should not really be considered in the grand scheme of things if you really like the Capitol output.The sound quality is really good, but the packaging is rather weak.  There is a single paper insert with no biography or liner notes to speak of inside a standard jewel case.  The sequencing is not chronological, but you can burn a disc or create a playlist on your iPod and sequence the songs any way you like.The biggest news here is the inclusion of \"Lady Red Light\" from 1987's \"Once Bitten\" album that did not make the earlier 2 CD's released from Capitol.  2001's Greatest Hits had 3 live songs (including \"House Of Broken Love\" and \"Desert Moon\") and a Blues Mix of \"Face The Day\" that are replaced here with the original studio versions.  I like this improvement as well as Capitol including all 13 singles from 1984-1992.  The 2 remaining songs are \"All Over Now\" from Once Bitten and \"She Only\" from 1989's Twice Shy album.Some fans may wish for a Led Zeppelin cover or two, but you really can't go wrong with what is here.  Capitol did a great job of maxing out this disc as well, with the running time coming in at 79:06.

{"text": "This single disc greatest hits release comprises fifteen tracks which isn't a bad tactic, just hit em between the eyes with your best tunes and walk out of the bar Its certainly better for some bands than a two disc set which does more to indicate they didn't have many great tunes!Released in 2011 this release has no excuse (outside licensing etc.) to not include all the choicest cuts. And that makes me ponder why there wasn't more from the Twice Shy album which many would probably conclude was their high water mark. Ultimately tunes such as Move It, Heart the Hunter, Hiway Nights and even Babys on Fire have more heft and soul than many of the numbers on this disc.There are however a bunch of the bands more rocking efforts such as their take on Once Bitten Twice Shy, Old Rose Motel and probably their biggest self-penned success of Mista Bone, a piece of double entendre that even Brian Johnson might have thought twice about. These numbers are spread throughout the disc and there was obvious thought given to the running order here as a range of the bands mellower numbers are interspersed throughout the track listing to break things up. The issue is that the band didn't really have that many pistol packers in their inventory, their harder numbers are hardly face melting to the point where any listener is going to be struggling for breath. And so many of their mellower numbers are poor creations.Effectively the problem is that Great White just weren't that good. Simple as that. And this collection explains why they were only second tier 80s hard rock on a good day, albeit theyd probably defend themselves by citing a preference for 70s slow burn rockers over 80s style histrionics. And a fair point that would be  but doesnt change that whatever they were aiming at, the results were rarely above fair to middling. Which is borne out by this release.Another downside when viewing this release as a whole is that there is no lyrics, no insight, no liner notes, nothing at all on offer in the booklet. A couple of band pictures and the track listing with writing credits underneath. Taken as a package there is no personality here at all. Which at least keeps it in sync with the band in general.If you have a hankering for 80s hard rock music you might want to look beyond the big bands of the era and start exploring the second tier and heck, even some of the third tier bands were good on their day and just failed to find their audience. However this release from Great White doesnt seem to do the band what middling justice they deserve. They had better and more lively tunes than much of what is here.PS - drumroll for the inevitable negative votes.\n", "val": 2.1071691662655212e-05}

Sure there are some good tunes on here, but this collection could have been so much better. I get it, radio hits drive sales, and this release includes all of their biggest radio hits. I personally get sick of bands putting out these so called \"greatest hits\" packages that just pander to the main stream. It's a disservice to fans that have followed them throughout the years. I've seen Great White live twice, once in the 80's and once in the early 2000's and at the latter show they didn't play half of the stuff that's on this disc, even though it had all been released at that point. They did, however, play every single one of the songs I listed as missing off of this disc... WTF Great White???\n", "val": 3.367211320437491e-05}

Phenomenal guitarwork, strong song structures, technical musicianship and beautiful clean sections. This album has everything you prog lovers want. Most of the album is clean sung (with obvious Cynic influences) but there's definitely aggression here as well.This is my personal favorite album of the year so far. This coming from a guy whose heard Born of Osiris' The Discovery, The Human Abstract's Digital Veil, Protest the Hero's Scurrilous and yes, Between the Buried and Me's The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues.

Yeah, that stuff can be impressive when approached from a \"technical\" standpoint but if you are not a musician you tend to lose interest in it after awhile or be hard-pressed to tell one track from another. So I approached this one with caution, but after reading some great things about Obscura (and being intrigued by the cool cover art I must admit), I checked out a webpage streaming their new album and must say, it rocked. Seriously. Each track was technical yet each had a melody which allowed them stand on their own. Another cool thing was the flawless production; each instrument was clearly mixed and you could hear them all with great distinction..yes, even the bass! The album is a very good example of blending beauty with brutality: it has acoustic intros/interludes, death growls/clean vocals, and more importantly, a balance of madness and melody. Anyway, I ended up ordering the vinyl edition which arrived the other day and it hasn't left my turntable yet...I am mezmorized by this damn thing!

I love the acoustic passages in the songs, and it is safe to say that these guys have blazed a trail that no one has followed yet. the hallmark of technical metal is the solo, and these guys are no different from any other tech metal band. the lyrics are mind-boggling, like they got their degree in both science and metal. these guys make you think instead of bang your head.

Omnivium works well as a natural continuation of the highly technical and progressive tendencies of its predecessor and ups the ante in regards to songwriting and the dazzling, complex song structures that are rich in dynamics and melody.Individual performances are outstanding, as one would expect after hearing their last opus.  What separates Obscura from the hordes of lesser tech death bands is their ability to craft memorable tunes that allow the music to breathe, saving space for the smoothly executed time changes and Obscura's knack for reigning in speed and blasts in favour of slower, crushing grooves and progressive interplay.  During these proggy moments bass player Jereon Paul Thesseling displays his phenomenal talents, combining superbly with the subtle cymbal work and tricky handiwork of drummer Hannes Grossmann.Speaking of drums, I would be hard pressed to name a better performance in recent years.  This guy has all the moves.  The double bass work is staggering in its complexity, intensity and groove.  Moments of tight blasting are complimented by strong variation and complex rhythms and fills.  With the constantly mutating swarm of technical riffage and intricate, melodic solos, it is easy to focus on the guitars, but the stellar rhythm section demands closer attention.The riffs come thick and fast, never outstaying their welcome or changing too constantly where they might become a distraction to what are refreshingly catchy songs.  'Septiagint' begins the album with a clean acoustic intro before following a shifting pattern of complex rhythms, revealing the stunning dynamics, spacey atmospherics and progressive elements that are weaved throughout Omnivium's core.  The lumbering, sinister groove of 'Ocean Gateways' is reminiscent of Domination-era Morbid Angel, proving that heaviness can still reign supreme in a technical firestorm.  Steffen Kummerer's clean vocals are sporadically scattered throughout the album.  His ethereal, otherworldly clean vocals add to the atmosphere and are not overdone; complementing the harsher vocals.  The more aggressive vocals vary in pitch though mostly stay on the lower, guttural end of the spectrum.Production can be a touchy subject and though in some extreme cases it can reduce the quality of an album, mostly production gripes come down to personal preference and offer a chance for critics to have a nitpick.  For the most part Omnivium is flawlessly produced.  The instruments are nicely balanced; the guitars are up front, sounding razor sharp and suitably heavy without overwhelming the subtle nuances of the bass guitar. The bass drums sound particularly strong, and feature a more natural, commanding thud than was present on Cosmogenesis.  The production is slick but not quite as polished as its predecessor, and overall Omnivium sounds more natural and organic without harming the strong atmospheric vibes that are still prominent.  If I do have one obligatory nitpick it's regarding the snare drum; it doesn't sound as forceful and robust as it should.  Nevertheless this is a miniscule blemish on an album that may just be the latest benchmark for the genre.  Obscura have risen to elite status in the technical death metal world.\n", "val": 0.03297745808959007}
{"text": "Omnivium opens with a beautiful, serene acoustic passage that still manages to sound immediately like Obscura, then blasts you with some thoroughly amazing riffs, bass-playing, and drums.  As soon as Septuagint, the first track, kicks in, you can hear the similarity to Cosmogenesis; in fact, this album could almost be Cosmogenesis, Part Two.  For some bands, that would be a bad thing, but not for Obscura.Even though Obscura doesn't really offer anything new or different here, what it does offer is frequently mind-blowing.  Hyper-speed technicality on every instrument (J.P. Thesseling, especially, does inhuman things with a bass); eerie, atmospheric slower sections; high and low death metal growls, plus a small amount of odd, ethereal clean vocals.  Pretty much the same vibe as Cosmogenesis without sounding like the exact same songs.  Every track reaches the same high level of expertise, with only Ocean Gateways sounding a little more like slower, standard death metal.  It might not be quite as intense and frantic as the others, but it's still an awesome song.  The opening two tracks are definite highlights, and Velocity has a crazy hyper-tech solo that stands out.  Also, Transcendental Serenade is another entertaining, dynamic instrumental piece, with weird clean vocals at the very end.Speaking of clean vocals, that might be the only slight difference on this album. They're still used sparingly, but sound less \"robotic,\" or mechanical than before.  I thought the robot-sounding voice on Cosmogenesis was too close to old Cynic, but now you can hear more actual voice.  But don't get the idea that it sounds like conventional singing; it's still typical Obscura strangeness.Even though this sounds similar to the last album in a lot of ways, I'm fine with that for now.  Obscura could catch on, and show signs of one day expanding their sound with more experimentation.  I personally would like to have a couple more albums like this one before they start to expand their boundaries.  This is up there with the elite in the technical death metal genre.\n", "val": 0.016703877598047256}

I really wanted to enjoy this cd, because I am a huge fan of all types of music especially prog/technical death metal. I have had this cd for about 6 months now and have given it multiple listens, now it just sits on a shelf. I purchased it after hearing such great reviews about this band. Unlike so many other reviewers that think this is by far the best tech/death metal band, I would have to highly disagree. One of my favorite bands are The Faceless, which have been compared to these guys. I in no way shape or form think that this band is even on the same realm as The Faceless or a lot of other tech/death metal bands.Lastly, I do not think that this band sucks, or this cd. I would have liked for each of the songs to have sounded unique in their on way with that \"IT\" factor which to me is clearly missing. I still say give this cd a try, you may love it like so many other reviewers, I just didn't.****ALBUM REVIEW UPDATE****Okay so maybe I still don't love the whole album but I have grown to like these songs: Vortex Omnivium (Except for that terrible solo towards the end it makes me laugh or cringe everytime)Velocity and A Transcendental Serenade.

{"text": "I'm not going to go to great length as I just recently wrote a rather long winded review for a video game on another website, and I'm all \"reviewed out\" at the moment.This album is amazing, and has been played a few hundered times since I got it (about two days after its release). This is simply the best Death Metal album since \"The Sound of Perseverance\". The musicianship is technically brilliant and the writing hits all of the familiar and expected spots while also being fresh, the only \"weak\" spot of the album being Hannes drumming. Not because he isn't extremely good (he is), but he just doesn't seem to do anything other than standard fast DM drumming with no frills or character to differentiate him from many other extremely good Death Metal drummers.The real treat of this album though is Christians guitar work. This man is not in Muhammeds shadow any longer, and I'd argue he is every bit as technically gifted as Suicmez while being a far better and more consistent writer. The vocals run the range from standard DM gravel grinding growls, to a sharper, raspier almost Black Metal harshness. And even a bit of clean singing, which is tasteful in its use without being overused.Don't know what else to say. I highly suggest any fan of extreme metal pick up this album.\n", "val": 0.0280825924128294}
{"text": "I originally heard a song from 'The Music Choice' on tv..it's a show on Comcast that just plays music..no videos.

Out of all the melodic death metal out right now these guys are very unique..I bought this album and copied it to my MP.3 player and was eager to listen to the whole album. Usually albums have 'filler'songs that you just can't listen to after 1 time. That is not the case here. Every song is a nice journey through one of metal's finest bands albums. I recommend this to anyone that wants to experience something slightly different. My only gripe is the album needed 3 more songs..but that's still worth getting. Hard hitting,melodic,Strong album material. I hope when they tour they come to the New Jersey Pennsylvania area. I even bought the shirt..It looks killer.

{"text": "Omnivium. This is the first album I've heard from these guys and I'm sure to check the other two that came before this one, but I can't emphasize enough just how good this one is. It's a breath of fresh air onto the metal scene.People are calling this \"Technical Death Metal.\" the way I see it, however, this is more \"Progressive\" than Technical, meaning that these musicians, while seriously skilled, use their abilities to focus on creating some wonderful \"thinking\" music, with several elements borrowed from styles that are not necessarily metal-related. Their skills do get shown a lot, but that is not the point of what they are playing, that happens as a side effect to the incredibly original songs they play. Anyway, one shouldn't care so much for these tiny Sub-genres labeling. \"Tech\" or \"Prog\", this is a beast of an album regardless of genre. Heck, even people who are not into \"Death\" Metal could become addicted to this band.I won't go into songs one by one, but I can say that, so far, my favorite two songs are PRISMAL DAWN and TRANSCENDENTAL SERENADE. The first is a super-creative song that start with slow \"coral\" singing and at the 02:00 mark blasts into extreme metal territory with incredible energy. It's really mind-blowing. The latter is quite simply the very best \"instrumental\" song I've heard on a metal album since Metallica's \"Orion\" from 1986. All other songs are awesome as well, and I did not find any one that could be considered \"filler\" or unnecessary.Finally, I'd like to point out one last thing: While all instruments are perfectly (and then some) played, the BASS on this album is something out of this world. I had never heard bass being so well executed on metal like this. It can be found everywhere, and even with it is very clear all the time and it gets some solo spots that will melt your mind. Truly fantastic.To sum it up, this is a must-buy record. This is the best Album of this year so far (I'm writing this in July) and I think it will be quite hard for anyone to top this so soon.\n", "val": 0.03481253981590271}
{"text": "Obscura is a German export that combines highly technical playing with solid death metal tempos and vocals. On their own, each of the musicians in this band is extraordinary, but together they are out of this world. If I had to make a comparison, I'd say the only band out there with more musical chops than Obscura is Opeth. If you are looking for Death Metal that challenges the listener then look no further.I first found out about Obscura when I bought Cosmogenesis about 2 years ago. Being a bass player I was immediately floored with Jeroen Paul Thesseling's ability to incorporate highly skilled fretless 6-string bass lines into heavy music without overpowering the composition or sounding wanky. Omnivium takes this to a whole new level as the songs have become faster, heavier and just crazy good all the way around. The band hasn't sacrificed any of its writing to come up with some fat B-string punishment. It is still Obscura, but with a hint of Covenant/Domination era Morbid Angel mixed in.Just get this CD ASAP!\n", "val": 0.01055216696113348}

It's clear that song is heavily influenced by Morbid Angel (probably after such a successful cover of \"God of Emptiness\" on their re-release of Retribution). But of course Obscura is a band of their own, and an amazing band at that. Obscura literally trumps any and all technical death metal that has been released to this day. Don't get me wrong I love The Faceless, Gorod, and Necrophagist...but Obscura undeniably holds the throne of the genre.Omnivium has much better production than its predecessor, Cosmogenesis. It's amazing to me how fast Obscura is maturing and redefining the tech death metal genre. My favorite songs include: Vortex Omnivium, Ocean Gateways, Euclidean Elements, Celestial down...and...and...I may as well just name every song, huh?

{"text": "As the other reviewers have written, Sovereign Grace is a tremendous blessing of a ministry.  I won't focus on the lyrical content of the songs; they are all excellent and theologically sound.Musically, I've never appreciated SG's music, so there's my truth-in-advertising statement up front.  I find most of it sounds predictable and forgettable. A lot of it wavers between music that is just slightly too fast and loud to be called \"contemporary rock\" and yet not aggressive enough to be called punk, leaving it in this lukewarm musical no-man's-land.  It's like they're trying to be radical but still sort of safe, you know?  Also, to my ears, their artists tend to sing with a distinct self-awareness vibe, which makes the album sound far more like a typical pop performance album rather than a template for worship.  I am hesitant to call that out, but others around me have independently identified the same thing, so I can't help thinking there must be something to it.  So that is how I am reviewing this album; as a Christian pop album.There are a couple of pretty good songs on this album - \"You Have Been Raised\" is an interesting mix of different tempos with a really catchy chorus... \"We Have Been Healed\" I actually introduced to a youth night where I lead worship, and it went over pretty well, I think.  And \"Behold Our God\" is a strong, lyrically simple track that would work well with a congregation.The rest of the songs - again, only musically - are just eh.  Not bad, not great.  If you are looking for musical innovation you are not going to find it here, or probably on any Sovereign Grace release.  I can see how certain people might like it, but I like music that is a little rougher, a little more raw and not so fancied up with perfectly clean production or wonderfully talented but ultimately interchangeable-sounding vocalists.\n", "val": 0.006406900007277727}
{"text": "Sovereign Grace should be applauded for consistently supplying the Church with gospel-centred music. The wider church has at times accepted poetic words and emotionalism in the place where only gospel truths should stand. This album continues in that tradition, rejoicing in the finished work of Christ on the cross.My one complaint with this album, as with their last release \"Sons & Daughters,\" is that with an increased emphasis on diverse arrangements and musical and melodic innovation, these songs are becoming more and more divorced from what should be their primary purpose: being used in congregational worship. Church worship teams are made of amateurs, many worship leaders are themselves people who hold full-time jobs in other vocations. Many of these songs have abrupt changes, especially from verses to chorus, changing wholesale in dynamic and feel. For the listener, this of course provides a rich and interesting experience. For the worship leader in a small local church struggling to emphasise content over musical style, it's a pottential nightmare.Let me stress that this is not so much about ability, but philosophy. Sovereign Grace has historically been all about congregational worship and serving local churches. This includes pursuing musical excellence. However, sometimes our quest for excellence obfuscates our primary quest to give glory to God.On the whole, the lyrical content is powerful and is certainly the strength of the album. This album takes hard-core, radical truths about Christ and puts them into words which can be easily sung, memorised and shared. The vocalists, in particular should be commended for excellent work. Their performances emphasize passion and response to Christ's work without sounding self-indulgent. Yet another consistent hallmark of Sovereign Grace releases.While the musical/arrangement dynamics may be too complicated and perhaps unnecessary, the style of production seems slightly more focussed and minimalist than previous releases. This enables the instrumentation to support the lyrical content without being distracting or overwhelming.The gem of the album is easily \"Behold Our God\" which provides clear truth with music that boils over with passion in the risen saviour and exactly what that means for believers both in grace for salvation and for daily fears and struggles. The melody is easy to learn and the chords are straightforward, yet innovative enough to provide essential support to the powerful words. Hopefully future releases move in the direction of this song as opposed to some of the less corporate-friendly songs on the album.If this were an album purely for listening, it would be 5/5 without question. However, knowing that Sovereign Grace desires to serve local churches with its music, I feel that this album falls short in that respect and may present more problems than solutions. An ideal compromise would be a live/corporate album with these wonderful songs, so that local worship leaders can access these songs without the barriers present on the album.\n", "val": 0.014969945885241032}

{"text": "Sovereign Grace Music released their latest album on Tuesday, March 22 called \"Risen.\" After having listened to it multiple times at this point I can honestly say... wow, what a great album! Sovereign Grace's music has generally been very high quality in terms of lyrics. What I mean by that is that the lyrics are well written and are meant to be sung in worship to our Great Saving God. They are generally lyrics that point us to the gospel of God's Son, Jesus, and teach us the glorious life giving doctrines of the Bible.That being said, in my opinion, the music behind these lyrics didn't start really sounding good until around 2004 with the release of Songs for the Cross Centered Life. Ever since that album Sovereign Grace Music's albums have really been phenomenal. I know almost every song from their albums since then: Worship God Live (2005), Valley of Vision (2006), Savior (2006), In a Little While (2007), Come Weary Saints (2008), Psalms (2008), Looked Upon (2008), Together for the Gospel Live (2008), Next 2009 Live (2009), and Sons and Daughters (2010).And even since the albums beginning in 2008 their stuff has gotten really good! So, how about this Risen album? Will it live up to the hype? The most recent Sons and Daughters album was excellent from beginning to end and even won some awards. Well let me be one of many to tell you that the Risen album is quite good indeed. Of all the great albums I've listened to from Sovereign Grace the songs on Risen gave me more of a sense of the reality of my Saviors gracious reign than ever before. The theme of the resurrection is so important for our lives now and our hope for the world to come. I have received great encouragement from this album.A few reasons why I really like this album:1. Biblically faithful. All of the songs are based around truths found in Scripture. And not only that, but many of the lyrics themselves are derived directly from certain passages.2. Musically beautiful. Not being an expert here, I thought it sounded great. The sounds really complimented and gave power to the words.3. Lyrically compelling. Many things are sang and arranged in such a way that really makes things stand out. It brings many moments where you realize you have never thought about this thing in this particular way before. Further, while remained incredibly faithful there are many memorable lines and choruses that will run through my head the rest of the day.4. Spiritually life giving. In the muck of life it is so easy to forget the glorious, astonishing realities of the gospel and the hope that we have as justified sinners. God used this album to gently lift my gaze and see His Son resurrected and exalted. He gave me hope that one day I will rise with my Savior. He reminded me of my new life now in the resurrected Christ. What glory! What kindness!I am so grateful to God for this album, though I am inexpressibly more grateful for the realities behind this album that make it all possible. Thank you God for the gospel of your Son! That He died and rose again on behalf of sinful people! Amen!\n", "val": 0.03392501547932625}

{"text": "For most of my life I'm not sure that I could have answered the question to any level of satisfaction, \"Does the resurrection of Jesus from the dead matter?\" I knew that it was important. It was obviously a big deal, deserving its own holiday. However, I assumed it was just a lofty theological concept that did not apply to me in my daily walk with Christ, and that it was just God showing that He could do things that we cannot. Admittedly, I'm slow, but as I reflect on the songs I grew up singing about the resurrection of Jesus, there was not much help in understanding this vital aspect of the Christian faith.The music we sing in church reflects what we believe, but it should inform our faith as well. This album is chock-full of songs that explore the depth of meaning found in the resurrection of Jesus. It is not just a lofty theological concept. When we face death, the resurrection matters. When we are tempted to live filled with guilt because of our sin, the resurrection matters. When we think that God could not forgive us, the resurrection tells us otherwise. Friend, mine the depth of this awesome truth and find hope today and for the life to come. You'll find this hope proclaimed on every track of this album.Stand-outs songs (in my opinion) are \"You Have Been Raised,\" \"To Live is Christ,\" and \"We Have Been Healed.\" Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.006631878204643726}

{"text": "I'm tired of hearing every other song from a woman on the radio singing of what evil a guy has done to her.  And it isn't the song itself that is the issue.  Some of these are songs that I like.  The issue is the abundance of negativity.  There's too much of it.  It's as if there's a quota that has to be met of how many female heartbreak issues need to come out in order to sell music.  I know there are some crappy men out there, but the songs coming out are as if every guy is bad.  One of my favorite artists is Mary J Blige.  Even though she's been through hell, she still releases positive songs for airplay.  And her music isn't all negative toward men.The thing with this song by Chris Brown is that it reminds me of another point.  There aren't enough songs out there about how guys feel about women (at times).  Women lie and cheat as well.  The only difference between men and women on this issue is that, more often than not, some women get mad about it when the subject comes up.  For guys, we know it happen.  So what, lets talk about something else.  Alot of men disrespect or cheat.  A lot of women disrespect or cheat.  So with that, I'd be surprised if there are any women who like this song.  This is one of those, \"it's about time\" songs where a guy steps up and say what women have been saying for years.  'Y'all mess up to and it needs to be acknowledeged.'  To paraphrase, Chris says, 'you sat there waiting for me to mess up and it ended up being you.  I'm moving on to something better, PEACE.'This is a good song and the beat is that laid back head nod music that adds to the feel of what all three artist on this track are saying.  You could almost look at this as a male version of Heartbreak Hotel by Whitney Houston.  (another good song)Yeah, it's about time for the guys to start telling it straight with songs like this.  The only thing is, if too many men release songs like this, then I'm gonna have the same issue that I have with the lady's being stuck on the same subject.  Be strong, grow up, quit crying and move on.\"Deuces\"\n", "val": 0.0003240188234485686}

{"text": "Honestly for Chris Brown, he just really has had a harsh time in the spotlight, since the startling strife from the abuse with Rihanna. Unfortunately, it showed with the lackluster strength of Grafitti, and it is still showing right here on Deuces. His latest single is just not up to par on what it could be for him. He also had that not just in the song, but in his breaking down performance at the BET Awards suring his tribute to Michael Jackson on Man In The Mirror. I think honestly that Chris should really take a longer look into himself and then get back out there. He really hasn't shown that he is reallly ready for a full-length return, aces high but deuces low for Chris.Song: D\n", "val": 0.00014539952098857611}

It has some good tracks, but the rest are great. I definitely recommend this to all skeptics and rap lovers alike. Not for the feint of heart. Or for dumbasses. It's for the people who like Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins, not Kent Hovind of Pat Robertson. Greydon is not Kanye. In fact, I deeply apologize for making that comparison. :)Hailing from Compton, you would think he's all gangsta (preconceived ideas), but Greydon is way above that - ex veteran with tours in Iraq and ex gang banger, he's reached that level of prowess that make him a household name in the music industry.I highly recommend this album (and the others as well) for fans of true hip-hop and rap.\n", "val": 0.03465896472334862}

{"text": "There is no question that Chris Brown has been through a lot in the spotlight. After being labeled as a girl beater from his ordeal with Rihanna for a long while, he has really went through his heartbreak, yet he is making the attempt to go back to square one as a singer. While his last album Grafitti was a huge lemon, he has made slow steps to get back to being recognized as a entertainer. He did hit a nerve with Deuces last year, and now with F.A.M.E. hitting Gold status, it is a slow-welcomed return to Chris as a singer. His latest single, She Ain't You, the second single from F.A.M.E., showcases a tribute to his late idol, Michael Jackson well and with a noble sample of the classic Human Nature. It is honestly better than the wasted samples from Michael's music, including his ex Rihanna's sample of Wanna Be Starting Somethin' a few years ago. While it isn't the best sampled Michael Jackson song, unlike SWV's better take on Human Nature with Right Here almost 20 years ago, it still is better than the 80's wasted-sampled songs that've came out like Lady Gaga's Born This Way, and The Black Eyed Peas The Time this past year. Hopefully, this can be a nice fresh start from Chris, and he can keep finding his way home well. The song is worth a try, and at least a better song than a lot of the lackluster songs from Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez out right now.Song: B-\n", "val": 0.0071588498540222645}

His ageless and classic melodies are apparent in Oceanea, taking you to another time, another place.  The very essence of what in my opinion, music is supposed to do. The critical thing lacking in today's music scene. I highly recommend checking out the EP Amerikana as well.  Journeys that cause mind to drift and an exploration of the soul I so longed for.  I eagerly await the release of \"Map of the Floating City\" as well.

{"text": "This track is so well written and produced. The lush sound-scape, performance, arrangement and choice of vocal fx are nothing you'll hear from any other artist out there.Thomas Dolby's music has evolved and matured beautifully over the years. It's obvius he's not simply laying down tracks in his studio; he's creating an audio sculpture and every moment of the piece is recorded with great care.Just when you are hypnotized by his vocals and reverberating landscape, you are then carried off on a soft breeze by the clean, perfectly pitched, sound of Eddi Reader's voice. Wow... could any producer ask for a better female vocal delivery? (Also check out Eddi Reader's vocals on Dolby's track \"CRUEL\" from the album \"Astronauts & Heretics. There is a magical chemistry when their two vocals trade verses. They need to record more tracks together.)So, five stars!What are you waiting for? Download this track now.\n", "val": 0.026920294389128685}
{"text": "Anyone who considers Thomas Dolby as an 80's one-hit (She Blinded Me with Science) or two-hit (Hyperactive) wonder, is missing out on a rich catalog of incredible music - with no two albums sounding exactly alike, save for Dolby's rich croon and lyrical wit.My favorite album, Astronauts and Heretics, is a lush, melodic, romantic, panoramic slice of Americana. Perhaps my least favorite (though not without its moments of genius) is the critical darling, The Flat Earth, which was a very experimental and clashed with the pop sugar of Hyperactive.His new work includes seven new songs that drift between Flat Earth and Astronauts. They don't rush up and grab you immediately. You won't \"get\" them by previewing the audio samples here. But they demand and reward attention and repeated listens.Dip your toes with this track - and then wade in for some more. From the Amerikana EP, there is a song called 17 Hills featuring Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler that echoes the theme song to Firefly, as well as an Astronauts-worthy pop single Road to Reno. I was not as crazy about the EP's center song, Toad Lickers: a country hoe-down featuring Imogen Heap that sounds like a Muppets skit.As for the rest of the Oceana EP - it's very experimental, quiet and pretty. Not as memorable or hummable as his best singles. Dolby is great storyteller - and the new album should hold some more pleasant surprises (another track from the album, Love is a Loaded Pistol, is a sweet, orchestral, jazzy number).He has created some elaborate online game for his Flat Earth Society members to play, a treasure hunt that leads to an early listen of the full \"Map of the Floating City\" album. I'll sit that one out, and wait for the full-length CD to be delivered to my door - I've waited 20 years for it, another few months won't kill me - especially since the pipeline is filled with even greater 80's return-to-form albums by Duran Duran, Devo, OMD, Blancmange, (most likely) The Cars - and to a slightly lesser extent, The Human League.\n", "val": 0.0014746412634849548}

I just feel for everyone in the biz when Mr. Brown finds his center music wise, he's just gonna MATRIX everything.  He's the closest thing working towards Michael Jackson the new generation that is.

{"text": "Let me start by saying Mint Condition is my favorite band since they released their 1st album. I've always been impressed by their variety of styles and their creative live performances. I appreciate the fact that all band members write original material. My favorite cd of theirs is \"Living the Luxury Brown\".Okay,i purchased \"7\" the day it was released (b sure 2 get the Best Buy version 4 the extra songs).I've listened 2 the entire cd every day.\"7\" is is good cd,but i thought it would have been better. I like the fact that they included more uptempo songs this time. The \"E-Life\" cd had too many ballads for one release. Now i'm aware that the females love the slow cuts,but too many tend 2 make an album drag. My favorite tracks are \"Mind Slicker\",\"Twenty Years Later\",\"Not My Daddy\",\"Can't Get Away\",and the \"extra\" track \"Cupid's Hunt\".\"Cupid's Hunt\" displays everything i like about the band. It's jazzy and funky at the same time. I wish they recorded more tracks in this style. The track \"Ease The Pain' is very funky,but the music arrangement doesn't do it justice. We all know when they perform this song live they will \"Mint\" it up,so why not record it that way?The track \"7\" seems awkward and the rap didn't flow so well. The songs i didn't mention are decent but didn't blow me away. As talented as this band is i'm still waiting for another really great soul/jazz/rock cd like \"Luxury Brown\".Not trying 2 b overly critical,it seems they tease us on the recordings and always blow us away with the live performances.\n", "val": 0.0015709837898612022}
{"text": "In this quest for real music these days, it is VERY hard to find anything not 'produced' by a hip-hop DJ using the same old beats, arrangements that are devoid of horns, strings and bass.  All we hear from today's 'music' is \"boom, boom - boom, boom!\"  Hardly music.The hip-hop is boring and all they talk about is selling drugs, using drugs, getting sex, wanting sex and killing.  You had rappers who were born that way, not you have actors being made and acting like rappers (Drake).  So, when you want real music, their are not many avenues to turn to.  You can run from the 'hip-hop' but when you go to R&B, all you get is a singing (barely) version of the hip-hop with the same old beats that sound home made.  If you want to go to rock to get away, you can't find that either, just organized 'jammin' without any singers or musicians.So...  It is refreshing that an actual BAND like Mint Condition can come out during these rough times of convergence on the sound (rap sounds like R&B, R&B sound like rap and both sound like pop) to bring some true R&B out!  The best part is - you hear REAL instruments that was made from the mind and not a sample!  Who would have thought that instruments would be played out?From the opening cut I knew and was hoping that this album would help ease the pain of this current state of 'music' and give me something that I can enjoy and it did!  The songs have strong beats, but they sound better because they made them up!  The songs are great and not simply singers trying to be like or act like rappers.  Yeah, they incorporate a little of this computer beat style to relate it to what get's played - but only a little.As the album goes on, it gets better and better.  You clearly see the benefits of having a band do music instead of a hip-hop DJ.  You hear it in the sound quality and arrangements, which are lacking in the hip-hop DJ.  I also like the fact that their skit consists of a musical break that brings back actual MUSIC instead of a joke or a sample.  You get reacquainted with musical variety instead of hip-hop DJ monotony.The only song on here that is not good is the title track \"7.\"  However, even that is better than a lot of what you hear on the radio.  I like the fact that they vary the subject matter and it is not about shakin it in the club or doing someone.  I highly recommend this album.  I hope that actual bands with actual musicians comes back in R&B and rock.  I prefer my R&B without the hip-hop.\n", "val": 0.0014240535674616694}
{"text": "One of the main things that defines this album is the same one that Mint Condition have always contended with-that they are a full fledged band devoted to creating  contempory R&B music as a self contained band of songwriters,producers and live instrumentalists. And I say the same thing of this album as I did of the previous album I reviewed:why is that necessarily so important? As if modern R&B is something to aspire to. Read any reviews on classic music here from all ages and you'll hear more reviews of classic recordings based mainly in comparing them with \"the horrible music today\" and these reviews are painful to read. That's because there is much great new R&B of all sorts being made in the modern style but there's also a lot more unintentive generic material in the same style as well. And even if they're now signed to a small indie label Mint Condition are again faced with that same situation since the condition of commercial R&B has worsened significantly over the years.  Now that's not to say that the first two numbers on here are not amazing. Staying true to their roots in the Minneapolis sound \"Can't Get Away\" and \"I Want It\" both have the same kind of skipping drum machine breaks,rhythm guitar riffs,synthesizer accents and major to minor chord accents to make them both highly innovative modern R&B as well as being based in a wonderful (and also innovative) funk style....that another guy from Minneapolis once pioneered in bygone days. Now if the album had kept moving from that point on this would've been one of their better albums. But if that's what one's looking for,depending on your point of view this album may not be your cup of tea. That's because the rest of consists of either generic modern and very pro toolsy digitized modern dance/R&B such as \"East The Pain\" or more generic ballads such as \"Not My Daddy\" featuring singer Kelly Price. The do it all very well but it doesn't show them moving on the way the self reflective and very abstractly jazzy closer \"Twenty Years Later\" which does indeed show the band moving the contempory R&B genre forward significantly.  Mint Condition are a band I've always wanted to like. I heard their songs for awhile now but never owned any of their albums. The reason being,for one is that I sensed,as I did with bands such as Toni Toni Tone before them that they would always have the struggle as a live oriented band of having to deal with the very hip-hop producer centered R&B community and would have a hard time maintaining any kind of stable musical integrity as a result. Again on this album they've kept any possible creative and artistic touches to a minimum and that's a tendency I really would like to see them remedy in the future. It would seem that anyone these days trying to be contempory and creative in the R&B genre are going to run into a good deal of difficulty and considering what this album offers up I am not certain how things will change if they do for a long time.\n", "val": 0.00011167056072736159}

Over the years, they have had moderate success with two Gold singles (1992's \"Breakin' My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes)\" and 1996's \"What Kind Of Man Would I Be?\"), and one Gold album (Their third album \"Definition Of A Band\"). With the success came an equal amount of setbacks, such as Jam & Lewis' Perspective Records shutting down shortly before the release of \"Definition Of Band\", and the label's parent company, A&M Records, also being shut down due to a corporate merger a mere two years later. They then embarked on a short-lived union with Elektra Entertainment for the release of 1999's underpromoted \"Life's Aquarium\". Six years would pass between albums and by the time they released their 2005 album \"Livin' The Luxury Brown\", they were on the indie label Image Entertainment, and the sextet dwindled to a quintet due to the departure of member Keri Lewis. After the release of \"E-Life\" in 2008, they laid low for a few years and resurfaced with a new album in 2011.Their newest effort \"7...\"- named for being their seventh studio album in their 20 year career- is their first offering on their new label Shanachie Entertainment. On this new album, they decide to tone things down and show a little restraint- which means that it's a straight to the point R&B album with no interludes, no songs experimenting with other genres, and no long winded jam sessions. The album starts opens with \"Can't Get Away\", a funky ballad about a man infatuated with a woman that's up to no good. They switch things up with the synth heavy uptempo \"I Want It\", while they contemplate ending a relationship on the ballad \"Walk On\". On the single \"Caught My Eye\", Stokely sings about approaching a woman who has fancied his attention. They retrace their two decade career on the title track \"7...\", while they pay tribute to mothers on \"Unsung\". Their duet with Kelly Price \"Not My Daddy\" is a slightly altered version of the song that was leaked to the internet earlier this year. The album ends with \"20 Years Later\", a story of a man who continues to burn bridges even as he grows older. Overall, this album is probably the most restrained album that Mint Condition has ever done, and it's also their shortest in their entire catalogue. It also serves as a reminder that they are still capable of creating quality material after all these years.\n", "val": 9.334607602795586e-05}

{"text": "Five band members, over a dozen charting hit singles and twenty years of classically-composed, contemporarily-rendered melodies and musicality. They were part of an emerging trend of male R&B acts when they hit the scene in the early 90s (Boyz II Men, Blackstreet and Jodeci, to name a few), but as of today, the quintet stands apart as the sole self-contained band of their generation. No matter what trends were prevalent on the urban landscape, Mint Condition cemented their reputation and enduring fan base by utilizing an organic (some would say old-school) and multi-layered approach, which appears intermittently on their Shananchie Records debut and seventh CD, fittingly entitled 7. [Note: the version being reviewed does not include the additiona bonus tracks available at Best Buy]The St. Paul, MN-based collective has always eschewed clichs---sex-starved lyrics, Auto-Tune and obligatory cameos by rappers-of-the-moment--- and on the tracks that find them at their best, Mint Condition is mesmerizingly modern and eclectic: a coolly duplicitous lover is put on blast in the edgy, up tempo \"Mindslicka\" (\"But when I found, every time, that you had another side/and how did I, not realize that I just slipped on your ice again\"), and urgent, 80s-era funk is what sets apart the opener  \"Can't Get Away,\" conveying the angst of a man caught in the clutches of a toxic relationship: \"Now I'm here at home alone, he's with you doin', what I want to be doin'/Maybe taking off your clothes, what can I do, gotta stop thinkin' about you.\"Another set of stellar moments come in the form of ballads: the sinuous \"Caught My Eye\" crystallizes that electrical instant of attraction and the whispers of apprehension that follow: \"Very nice to meet ya, Girl I like your features/maybe soon I could treat ya, to somewhere quiet no people/Or maybe get to know ya, over a chai or mocha/Saw you standing in line, Baby you caught my eye.\" The CD's most arresting vocal performance comes with the taut and tortured \"Walk Away,\" which displays the resonance of Stokley Williams' lower register that's typically only heard during live shows: \"Shame, this time it's all on me, the first time, you were to blame/We both don't we don't work, I should expect results, the same/So you don't need to get no closer, don't try to put that thang on me....\" \"Not My Daddy\" pairs Mr. Williams with the delicately nuanced alto of Kelly Price, their vocals pitch-perfect and the band's instrumentality a climactic component as the two convey a couple battling archaic expectations in their relationship: \"Trust, without it there's no love. It's true no matter what you try....I spy, you seek, you watch, I peek, so what are we doing with our love? It's not how it's supposed to be.\"While the rest of their songs still eclipse the majority of what can pass for R&B these days (such as the tender, piano-anchored tribute, \"Unsung,\" and the hip-hop-helmed \"7\", which cleverly intertwines titles from their many hits into a smooth, spoken word soliloquy), some of them seem robotically rendered or creatively truncated: \"20 Years Later,\" for example, echoes the fury and chaos that a struggling drug addict feels as his life veers out of control (\"Now I'm with another friend's ex, told her she can't call, he's my roommate, would be drama, but really, I'm married, just turned 47, and I now I'm back here with my mama\"), but it dissipates without lyrical or emotional closure. \"I Want It\" is catchy, but beneath their skill set, and what could've been an arresting instrumental, \"Bossalude,\" hovers somewhere between perky and pedestrian.Simply put, 7 doesn't touch the scope of 2005's Livin' the Luxury Brown, and compared to 2008's eLife,certain tracks feel...well....rushed (not exactly sloppy, but undercooked and free of marinate). More than appealing for the casual fan and worthy enough, if not wonderful, for their most ardent FOOMS (the band's acronym for Friends Of Our Music), Mint Condition's seventh CD may update the band's modus operandi, but listeners who crave their unique artistry will wish that they didn't do so by leaving much of their trademark instrumentation behind.\n", "val": 0.012226494029164314}

{"text": "Mint Condition's latest release 7... proves why, for twenty years, this band has been an automatic buy for me. The 11 songs on the CD are worth the 3-year wait since E-Life and drive home the fact that unlike other artists, who lose their potency between releases, each time out MC stays relevant, necessary, and refines their ability to tell stories through superior musicianship.WHAT'S HERE: The musical gumbo MC fans have come to crave. Soul. Funk. Rock. Hip Hop. Jazz. Gospel. R&B. All skillfully blended together in a way that seems to channel the collective consciousness of their ardent listeners. From the haunting, open wound of Can't Get Away to the reflective self-tribute 7, to the compelling duet on Not My Daddy to the Sankofa stank, ham hocks in your cornflakes, pinch of Al Green in my personal favorite Ease the Pain, the songs on 7 deliver a consistent and extraordinary experience.WHAT'S MISSING: Audacious Mint Swag. Don't get me wrong. These brothers brought the noise. Most of the songs on 7 are of superior quality and musically indelible. But I'm spoiled and greedy. Spoiled by past releases that showcased the unique way the band can attack a note, a phrase, a riff, a rhythm, an emotion and transmit it into something I can feel and carry with me for days. [A la Try My Love off the Meant to Be Mint CD.] In past projects, MC had a way of, oh so respectfully, getting up in your face with their brilliance. I miss the intros, interludes, reprises, and changes within songs that are indulgently decadent and giftedly flamboyant--like they were saying: \"Take that! That's right, we baaad. We got that good funk, y'all; you d'int know?\"That's the taste of Mint this FOOM craves. I like it when they're cocky (musically poppin' collars and showing off), because for the past twenty years they've managed to do cocky in a way that's responsible--adding something unique and matchless in the industry.Let's face it. R&B is on an emergency room gurney and on life support. With the album 7..., audiophiles are assured that when the proverbial Dr. Funkenstein stands above the operating table with paddles in hand, hollers CLEAR, and zaps the fading genre, the pulse that returns to us reliably and the beat that we'll hear will be Mint Condition.BUY THIS CD.

To say that was a disappointment is an understatement. I thought I'd done my research on Seven and saw lots of positive reviews.In my opinion there are only two tracks that are interesting, and they're unsurprisingly enough the tracks played on the digital radio stations I listen to.Now, I must say that musically, these guys are tight. They can play well and the vocals are delivered properly too. It's just that I no longer enjoy listening to them. I couldn't turn it off quickly enough.I'm putting it down to me and, not them so I heartily recommend anyone thinking about this cd to listen to it properly. For me it's not a \"grower\" or work that has hidden depths it's just a turgid mess I fail to understand or appreciate, but that's musical tastes. The only reason I'm giving it two stars and not one is because of the high standard of musical ability they display.I certainly won't allow previous good work distract me from current failings again.

MC is the last TRUE band and any real fan should appreciate the fact that they love us and music so much that they keep giving us what we need...REAL MUSIC considering what is being offered up by so called artists today. the industry hates creativity nowadays it's more like how many beyonces, justin beibers or lady gagas can we shove down people's throats and convince them it's real music, and they get the spins on the radio, and the awards, while real creativity and TALENT goes unrewarded, until the fans say, I APPRECIATE YOU! that's MC's grammy. if they have to water themselves down to get accepeted by the masses i would rather them just stop all together. listen to albums ONE through SEVEN and enjoy the EVOLUTION OF THE MINT!BUY THIS, BUY THIS, BUY THIS!\n", "val": 0.0036851780023425817}

{"text": "\"7\" is the appropriately titled new album from Mint Condition, a quintet that, unfortunately, has not received the superstar status that it deserves.  This is probably due to the fact that the band is just too good for the average radio listener.

Front man Stokely Williams has never sounded better and he is especially in fine form on \"Not My Daddy,\" the duet with guest Kelly Price, \"Caught My Eye,\" the title cut, \"Unsung,\" and the thought-provoking \"Twenty Years Later.\"  The Latin-influenced \"Bossalude\" really showcases the group's versatility and should attract a new audience of Condition fans.However, those tracks are equally matched by the other nine powerful selections, providing a listening experience that is destined to satisfied long time followers and \"newbies\" alike.For a group that has been around for twenty years, the members of Mint Condition sound as fresh as they did when they burst on the scene with such early 90's hits \"Breaking My Heart(Pretty Brown Eyes)\" and \"U Send Me Swinging.\"\n", "val": 0.007752378936856985}

My favorite tracks include Mind Slicker, Can't Get Away, Unsung, and of course MC delivered another beautiful ballad in Caught My Eye.  I also love the track, Not My Daddy featuring Kelly Price, another amazing talent.  Thank you MC for continuing to evolve and deliver the music I love.  I am a fan FOREVER!!  Side note: If you haven't seen a live MC performance, their energy and showmanship is incredible!\n", "val": 0.03799091652035713}

{"text": "This is as creative as  the \"Mint\" has been in a while. The band does hold back on some songs, you can tell that in a live setting, these songs are gonna be something good for the earhole. They continue not to be jaded by the industry. I have always liked the fact they they don't try hard to be mainstream. This is something a lot of other bands should try. I miss the wide open approach they had with the \"Definition of a Band or Life's Aquarium\".  The band does continue to show their creative side. I just want more of it. I like the songs \"Mind Slicker\" nice groove cut, also \"Ease the Pain\", there is also, \"I Want It\" which could have been Part1 of \"I want it Again\" with a twist. \"Walk On\" is a nice ballad, the same can be said for \"20 Years later\". I do miss the early energy of the band. I remember when the opened for Janet Jackson back in the day, I knew they were special. I am also glad they did not comprimise their musical integrity. Too bad though they don't get the \"AIRPLAY\" they deserve, as they are one of the last great R&B bands of the last 20 Years. So if you like their previous works, add this to the collection. Now I want a danceable CD from them one more time. Overall, this is a great cd. I really like the \"Live cuts\" they give you an insight to what they are all about. Great vocal band, would like to get another 20 years of music out of them\n", "val": 0.01181003637611866}

{"text": "These two masterpieces have never been available on CD until recently, having been released originally in 1976 and 1977. I literally wore out five vinly albums of Out There Tonight. I have looked for this band on CD for over 36 years, and man, was it ever worth the wait. Having never really heard anything from their first release, Strange Streets, it is like rediscovering this great band all over again. Garfield is almost impossible to properly label, I term I abhor anyway. I suppose they could be called a Canadian folk progressive art rock band, but that is simply not all the story. If you are a fan of ELP, Genesis, Peter Gabriel, Yes, Pink Floyd, Supertramp, Jethro Tull, and all the other great  late 70's progresive \"art rock\" bands, then chances are you will love Garfield, because there are elements of every one of these bands in their music. Lead singer Garfield French has a very unique and emotive yet androgynous, almost sad, sounding voice, highly reminiscent of Rodger Hodgson of Supertramp...especially on the more piano and acoustic guitar heavy numbers offered on these two releases. But there is plenty of prog rock heaviness, complete with layers of Moog synthsizers, string ensembles, and diverse percussion as well. Garfield understands dynamics and mood as well as anyone of this era. I was truly fortunate to have seen them live in San Antonio, TX in 1977, and they were as talented and \"heavy\" as any band I have ever seen in my forty plus years of concerts. If you are a fan of this gendre, or if you just enjoy talented musicians giving it everything, I strongly recommend you get yourself a copy this double CD package. The remastering of these two CDs is nothing short of amazing, and it's sonic ambience will take you on a journey you will not soon forget. Get it now!\n", "val": 0.009801248088479042}
{"text": "Garfield is the first name of the main guy in the group, no relation to the corpulent cat!  This was one of the few Canadian bands whose sound approximated the British art rock of its day, you know, the more melodically oriented styles of Cat Stevens, Strawbs, and Supertramp, but with some Loggins and Messina and a bit of US southern rock thrown in.  Very theatrical and flambuoyant at times, yet with a simple folksy charm as well, often in the same piece.  With their first 2 albums, generally regarded as their best, packaged together here, you can't lose.  Best cuts will depend on where within this broad spectrum you absorb best, but my top picks are \"Above Market Street\", \"Ride the Waves\", \"Eyes\", \"All Alone Again\", \"Play it Again Boys\" and \"Look at Yourself\".\n", "val": 0.024388378486037254}

{"text": "There's something to be said about good old fashion Gospel music, the kind of Gospel music that fills the sanctuary with hand clapping, tambourine tapping, guitar slapping praise. It's uncensored, uninhibited and most of all, unpretentious. It's the kind of music that so many Gospel fans grew up on, listening to on their parents' stereo or on vinyl or even 8-track tapes.It's this kind of good old fashion Gospel music that sets the atmosphere for a Holy Ghost revival and just lets the saints praise God all Sunday morning. And it's this kind of church music Grammy award winning artist, Smokie Norful and the 12th District AME Church Choir recapture and reintroduce on their ode to Traditional Gospel music on the album, How I Got Over: Songs That Carried Us.The album is a spiritual delight, from beginning to end, as Smokie delivers his titanic tenor vocals, alongside a well-coached church choir for a chilling effect that will have you dancing like David in the pews.The album opens up with the Sunday Morning Medley which includes enthusiastic standards like I'm A Soldier In The Army Of The Lord, God Is A Good God and Praise The Lord Everybody. By the time the final song from the medley is sung, you're ready for the Word for the day. Norful brings added ammunition with guest appearance by the anointed Myron Butler.In keeping with the theme and content of How I Got Over, Smokie Norful brings a pioneer for old Gospel music to the stage with Melvin Williams singing the church anthem, Solid Rock. You'll be rocking way into the midnight hour on this holy anthem.Church is in full swing by the time another legend stands at the podium, as Vanessa Bell Armstrong brings her own swagger and spirit to the unforgettable standard, Trouble In My Way.  Every time I hear Vanessa sing, I'm reminded of a very young, pastor's daughter named Aretha Franklin, who ironically grew up just blocks away and years apart from her mentor. It's another beautiful tribute song to when Gospel music was the sole property of the church.Adding a little levity to the mix is Smokie Norful recounting his days growing up in church as a pastor's son. It's the perfect introduction to the next chapter on the CD, The Hymn Medley, which features Smokie and his father, Pastor W.R. Norful, Sr. leading the worship songs like Father, I Stretch My Hands To Thee, I Need Thee and Yes Lord. Images of a church in benediction mode are easy to envision on this moving medley of hymns.The album takes a sharp and unexpected detour on to a funky track with The Lord Will Make A Way, a song that most Gospel followers will identify. However, the arrangement on this beauty is totally 2011, as one of Gospel music's finest voices today, Sheri Jones-Moffett, brings her electrifying voice to the table and ushers in a bluesy version, reminiscent of Otis Redding, that will have you standing at attention, shouting in tongues like it's Sunday morning service.How I Got Over concludes with the Communion Medley, a series of songs that recounts the rich story of the Resurrection with selections like The Blood Will Never Lose It's Power, There Is Power In The Blood and Nothing But The Blood.Smokie Norful pulls one final rabbit out the hat with the introduction of Gospel legend and lead singer of the Mighty Clouds Of Joy, Mr. Joe Ligon on the timeless hit, I Know It Was The Blood. From song to song, from medley to medley, it's Smokie Norful bringing back the standards that were sung in the chapels, churches and tabernacles across the country. How I Got Over is a real treasure chest of church songs that kept the saints through some difficult storms and through some long weeks. It's a classic album that's certainly worth its weight in gold.\n", "val": 0.02659333311021328}

The song that really surprised me and left me with goosebumps all over, was the last song on the album: Leaning on the everlasting arms. This song is so naked: Only Kenny and a beautiful church organ joining him on the last chorus, it's so beautiful! It's almost as if Kenny is standing right in front of you singing! A surprisingly naked production compared to the other songs which are arranged with tasteful instruments and choirs and super guest artists! All the arrangements are by Warren Hartman, Kenny's keyboard player the past 20 years or so, with the legendary Kyle Lehning giving a helping hand on the production side.

It flows smoothly like a river from the opening \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\" through the unexpected treatment of \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" at the end. Warren Hartman and Kyle Lehning have done a masterful job of production, avoiding the usual pounding piano, screaming Hammond, and shouting choir heard so often. The music flows from old hymns (I'll Fly Away, In the Sweet By and By, What a Friend We Have In Jesus, etc.) to more contemporary tunes (Peace, The Rock of Your Love, He Showed Me love, etc.) very smooth and even, and a Hartman arrangement of Amazing Grace is nothing short of \"amazing\". Far from being a \"stand up, clap your hands, and yell Amen\" work, it is fairly quiet, subtle and reflective. A spiritual and beautiful work. Rogers' voice rises to the occasion.

The music on Kinetik has certainly changed, but I would mostly agree with the others that the dark ambiance, which makes his music so good, still flourishes. However, much of the tribal influence is unfortunately missing this time around, which is a shame because I love that sound when it's incorporated into electronic music (eg Juno Reactor).

{"text": "I have just gotten into electronica in the last year and a half, and I tell you that this guy is the best electronic DJ I have heard. People sometimes label Phutureprimitive as dubstep, but he actually is a style called psychill, which is more like atmospheric electronica but with more bass.Overall, the album is rich in synths and bass drops, with a kind of a blend of an urban and a tribal feel to most of the songs. DISAPPEAR is the only song that really features any singing, and that singing is pretty strange sounding, but it's good. The songs DO start to sound similar and some of the songs are a bit repetitive, but not to the point of getting boring. Thankfully, he doesn't get into abrasive wobbling like Skrillex or Excision, but he does use a lot of distorted bass.If you like the feel of drum n' bass without the dizzying effects of dubstep but still have music with some oomph to it, purchase this album!I haven't checked out any of his other albums yet but I plan to soon.\n", "val": 0.01165324728935957}

It's fresh, but I was not expecting dub type sounds. Ok, but after listening to the album without switching through songs and scanning about, and just letting it play, the classic well blended aspects of the band came through once again. It's a bit more up beat than early 2000 style albums, who doesn't like the music that came out during that time. It's getting tough to beat that style, although technology is helping clarify the sound and give more precision and diverse sounds.

{"text": "Rebecca Black's latest (and first) opus, Friday, succinctly tells the tale of a young girl on the cusp of womanhood. Ms. Black uses the days of the week as a metaphor for maturity.  Throughout the song, Rebecca makes sure to point out that Thursday precedes Friday, Saturday follows, and Sunday afterwards.  Let's take this point-by-point:Thursday - Thursday represents youth and excitement.  As the day before Friday, Thursday is the first day of the week where hope begins to surface.  The teenager is finally beginning to approach the end of a long and awkward period of bodily changes, hormonal surges, and - unless you're the kid in the back passenger seat of the Sebring - the first terrifying sexual experiences of their lives.Friday - Maturity.  Adulthood.  Grown.  We approach Friday with unlimited expectations and possibilities.  Maybe you'll meet the love of your life at the mall, or maybe Kelly will at least let you feel her up at Matt's party.  Friday is fraught with possiblities.Saturday - Redemption.  The ability to get back on the proverbial horse.  When Friday (read: your life) doesn't pan out exactly as you expected it to, Saturday is there to offer you the gift of a second chance.  Maybe you got kicked out of the mall for loitering and Kelly laughed in your face, but on Saturday you can try again.Sunday - Fear.  After mentioning Sunday's alignment, Rebecca remarks, \"I don't want this weekend to end.\"  Rebecca fears death.  I'm sure the reader is thinking, \"Duh... who doesn't fear death?\"  But think about when Rebecca mentions this fear: On Friday - the day that represents a persons' first foray into the world.  Rebecca skillfully articulates the emotions of all young adults beginning their journey to independence.The first-time listener to the song is probably thinking, \"What about Monday through Wednesday?  Why doesn't Rebecca mention the other half of the week?\"  These days are mentioned.  Much like the ending of The Sopranos, Rebecca says the most by saying the least.  Monday through Wednesday represent the long, dark, slumber of the soul.  Rebecca's fear, every week's destiny, the end of an old cycle, and the start of a new.For a girl who is a mere 13 years of age, Rebecca displays the wisdom of the first Greeks who had the courage to ask \"why are we here?\", a mastery of symbolism that rivals the great Renaissance painters and sculptors, a grasp of subtlety that puts The Bard to shame, and a soul that makes Mother Theresa look like a Nazi.I've always wondered what it would look like to watch a generation gain It's Voice.  Now I know.5 stars.\n", "val": 0.020716048777103424}

Is this song and video the sign of the apocalypse coming?  Come on, people!  It's just a song by a young girl who is trying to have a little fun with this gift of recording time from her parents.  The awful lyrics in the song are no fault of Rebecca's.  They were written by the production company, Ark Music Factory.  Ark also has to take the blame for the production quality.  Rebecca's voice leaves a bit to be desired.  But, she is just 13 and, if Fergie's non-existent voice can be made spectacular by `studio magic', then Rebecca Black has a chance, too.  In the end, this is just a slightly amusing, breezy, insignificant pop tune.  Rebecca seems to have enjoyed making it and she seems to `get it' about the notoriety it has brought her.  It's just `fun, fun, fun, fun'.\n", "val": 0.0014932651538401842}

{"text": "Let's take a look @ \"Friday\" shall we:\"7am, waking up in the morningGotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs\"Waking up quite early, and knows she has to be fresh for her day. She has a routine that is not quite so familiar to her that she can get by without reminding herself of it. We all do this but sometimes we forget to question why??? We follow societal norms only to be let down but here Rebbecca sees it as \"fresh\", a snake shedding its skin and being reborn. It dances between the sub conscious and the conscious. She was asleep upstairs but awakens to a new consciousness and likens it to a downstairs motion thus a rebirth of one's self. Going from unconscious to conscious. She lives on neo platonic astral plane but realizes that it is time to revisit the conscious world and explain her new found consciousness.\"Gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal\"Clearly in a central world it is necessary for need a bowl for cereal however here Ms. Black is metaphorically speaking of feeding your consciousness the bowl it self is much like a Tibetan bowl used for meditation in order to feed the mind.\"Seein' everything, the time is goin'Tickin' on and on, everybody's rushin'\"Here she has entered an either further decent into from sub conscious and conscious at the same time. She has realised that conscious time now matters and can no longer be on be on the astral plane of the time as cosmic time. She has figured this out at the age 13.\"Gotta get down to the bus stopGotta catch my bus, I see my friends\"The bus itself represents a metaphor for those who are choosing an outer dualistic experience. There is no control within one's own self, only the bus driver and it is up to Rebecca to inform them that while you have the choice and free will to \"catch the bus\" the real answer is somewhere else.\"Kickin' in the front seatSittin' in the back seatGotta make my mind upWhich seat can I take?\"This is the Crux of Rebecca's path back to enlightenment. While she has chosen not to take the bus she has found another way back to the astral plane however in her hesitation she make's a fatal mistake. Instead of just embracing whichever seat is available she finds that there is no seat available the car is full. If she were in the front seat she would control her own destiny by choosing the driver's seat but she has hesitated. A warning to all of us. The world is not dualistic like many religions portray it to be.\"It's Friday, FridayGotta get down on FridayEverybody's lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend\"This is Black's path to enlightenment. She isn't excited about it being Friday night, she's excited about it being Friday morning and going back to that the astral plane she had discovered in her uncontentious mind may still be possible\"Partyin', partyin' (Yeah)Partyin', partyin' (Yeah)Fun, fun, fun, funLookin' forward to the weekend\"Again Ms. Black has moved away from enlightenment but still may be able to make it back to that cosmic conscious plane of rebirth if she can stay focused within her own self and not her 13 year friends tempting her in the wrong direction.\"Yesterday was Thursday, ThursdayToday i-is Friday, Friday (Partyin')We-we-we so excitedWe so excitedWe gonna have a ball today\"Thursday she was on the path to enlightenment as mentioned in the beginning of the song however she has been tempted as mislead by her friends in the car taking away from the path. She may feel she is having fun but in actuality she has strewn across the plane thus moving away from enlightenment.\"Tomorrow is SaturdayAnd Sunday comes after...wards\"Here she begins to realize that given time she can be moving back in the right direction.This is the part of the song that throws people off the most. It's appears to be completely inappropriate --Who is this guy?\"R-B, Rebecca BlackSo chillin' in the front seatIn the back seat\"He has become her guide back to enlightenment showing her the truth path. He's pointing out that she is all over the place and straying from the path and not in control of her own destiny.\"Passin' by is a school bus in front of meMakes tick tock, tick tock, wanna scream\"Remember the bus metaphor as representing a dualistic version of the world with only one driver driving people astray well our rapping friend has finally showed Ms. Black the way. A yogi of the freeway allowing her to choose her own destiny.\"Check my time, it's Friday, it's a weekendWe gonna have fun, c'mon, c'mon, y'all\"And thus we have the conclusion of the wayward path. Our rapper guide has shown us that sometimes in life we stray from our true destiny however it's okay as long you realize you have strayed and can move back to the cosmic astral plane which in essence is all part of the journey.__________________\n", "val": 0.00018259497301187366}

I tend to regard pop music with an odd sort of suspicion.  I've never really understood why, but I've always regarded the lyrics as insipid.  However, listened to Rebecaa Black's \"Friday,\" and . . .. . . what's going on here?  Excuse me a minute.  There's a stain on my wall--it seems to be spreading.  It looks like my walls are . . . bleeding.Oh God.  It is blood.  I can smell the iron-tinge of it, causing me to retch.  I grab a sponge and begin to scrub.  But the blood . . . the blood just spreads all over the white stucco surface.  My Lord . . . what's happening to me?I turn and look at the picture of my family.  Their eyes are all missing.  The smiles, once rich with happiness, have dissipated.  Only savage coutenances of pain remain etched across their otherwise unmoving features.Am I insane?  What's happening to me?  Or is this reality?A cacophony begins to sound within my head.  \"Friday, Friday, FUN FUN FUN!  Friday, Friday, FUN FUN FUN!\"No.  This is not fun.

{"text": "I'm a middle school teacher, so on this past \"Friday\", I couldn't make it ten minutes in a row without hearing of this song.  I finally got a chance to hear the song as a couple students played it for me on You Tube after school, and there was nothing surprising about it other than the depths to which its lameness plunged.  This song typifies our new cultural mindset: everybody deserves, nay, is entitled to being a celebrity.  To facilitate this, we CGI and brush images and slather on minerals and make-up to make images appear to be what they are not, and we auto-tune and over-produce sounds to make it seem as if each one of us is, \"the next American Idol\".\"Friday\" is the death of the American Dream come reality.  Whereas the American Dream in all its imperfections had in the past been about achievement, now it is simply about being recognized and famous.  Innovation, creativity, hard-work, integrity, and spirit are the collateral damage.However, I am given hope, I think, by the other reviews on this page, because after reading them and thinking for a moment that I awoke this morning in The Twilight Zone, I have begun to think that the reviews here are attempting to make \"Friday\" something worthwhile.  I cannot read the reviews on this page now without thinking of the iconic \"Three Wolves\" shirt and its now famous reviews.  I must believe, for the sake of all humanity, that this is what is going on here.  And if it is the case, then sorry Rebecca, but that is exactly what you deserve for releasing such trash and buying into the \"We're all stars\" mentality of your generation.

{"text": "I tend to avoid mainstream pop music, especially the stuff aimed at tweenagers (Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, etc).  But when I make an exception, it's for a very special song -- and one such song is Rebecca Black's \"Friday.\"Few songs in my life have touched me as deeply and powerfully as this one song. This stirring, symphonic melody rises with a chorus of \"yeah-ah-ahs!\", over a stretch of gritty synth and wild beats. Black's angelic, shimmering voice lulls you with her expansive vocal range until you barely notice the subtlety and brilliance of the lyrics.Oh, the lyrics. In what other pop song could you hear dazzling symbolism like \"I'm drivin', cruisin'/fast lanes, switching lanes\"?  In what other could you hear evocative poetry like \"Yesterday was Thursday/Today is Friday\"? In what other could you hear such a searing, scathing glimpse into the psyche of American's youth, such as \"Gotta make my mind up/which seat can I take?\"Indeed, young genius -- which seat should you take? Clearly she is debating whether to embrace the predictable safety of suburban life (back seat) or the wild unfettered life of a true artist (front seat). IN NO OTHER SONG will you find such unabashed genius. I get woozy just thinking about it....Okay, time to turn the sarcasm off. This song is every bit as bad as most people say it is -- a massive sonic hairball of ear-curling vocals, flaccid pop tunes and devastatingly vapid lyrics. Most tween pop is vapid, but this waves a banner with shining V-A-P-I-D letter emblazoned on it.Honestly, Black's vocals are horrible -- flat and autotuned into a droning whine, until you just want to punch your speakers to make the yowls of \"Fryyyyydaaaaayyy\" stop coming out of them. And you cannot even be distracted by the music because we just get a thin glittery blanket of tepid techno  that doesn't really even have a tune.And oh.... the lyrics. If you wanted to sing a song about partying on the weekend, don't bore us with descriptions of driving, eating cereal and being passed by schoolbuses. To make matters worse, Black bores us with descriptions of how Friday comes after Thursday and before Saturday, and how Saturday is right before Sunday. Is this song aimed at the Sesame Street crowd?Rebecca Black's \"Friday\" is one of those transcendently horrible songs that achieves novelty status because it is JUST THAT BAD.

{"text": "Ott's third and latest album shows his continued devotion to heavy production value. While this is true, he does vary from his usual sounds in this album. While Blumenkraft (2003) and Skylon (2008) were years apart, they were very unique to his own sound which one might be accustomed to hearing from his work with Simon Posford on Twisted Records. It makes sense that this album, unlike his last two, are not released on Twisted, but instead have been released on his own recently developed label dedicated to himself called \"ottsonic.\" This speaks volumes about what you can expect to hear on the album. It's easy to hear more contemporary influences in this album than it is from his past work, especially looking at his basslines. While the album as a whole boasts the dub sound he's known for, he strays from the usual but makes what he's changed his own.The first track, \"One Day I Wish To Have This Kind of Time\" is decidedly ott-tastic. Ambient intro, samples, and ringing snare triplets that drop into an incredibly joyful and major-scaled bass driven melody, the patented `dub siren' rings out often, there's emphasis on the offbeat sounds, and a melodica to tie it all into the style. It's also an ideal way to begin an album like this; beautiful ambience with a calming overlay of soft vocals. \"Adrift in Hilbert Space\" is a track he released as a single on Ottsonic records preceding the album, so one would assume he favored this track. It ties together an incredibly varied source of sounds, beginning with a guitar and synchronized vocal cuts that echo his use of middle-eastern styled vocals in much of his previous work and help with Shpongle and Hallucinogen on Twisted Records. Halfway through this song Ott it shifts completely, bringing a large crescendo that drops into something that resembles contemporary dubstep, focusing on wobbly bass and glitching sounds that shuffle around with no particular pattern or idea. This section is, if you're a big fan of Ott, incredibly jarring to hear as it isn't at all his style. While he does do a very clich `big drop' into a heavy wobbling bassline that is very unlike his old quick-attack driven filtered basslines, he keeps it true to the dub style for the rest of the album. He makes it work in a way, but if you've enjoyed his past music you'll be left wondering why he allowed himself to bring in that god damn over-used wobble bass. \"Owl Stretching Time\" continues with more wobbling basslines, though this one is much better put together than the last. Like the tracks that drove his earlier albums, the bass gives a driving melody this time. The song overall is a letdown, though. It lacks variety and any unique or interesting feel. The vocal samples don't seem to fit; they're mostly spoken and don't fit the song quite as well as most vocals Ott generally uses. The bassline melody what really sticks out on this track. \"Squirrel and Biscuits\" is definitely my favorite track on the album. It's got a swinging and dynamic upbeat rhythm, a constant barrage of experimental sounds and samples, and progressive melodies. The track also boasts a beautiful world-music styled vocal section around the 4 minute mark, reminiscent of the female vocals in \"Rogue Bagel\" and \"Roflcopter\" from his album Skylon which was a very vocal album. While it doesn't quite shine like some of his other vocal driven tracks like \"Smoked Glass and Chrome\" from his first album Blumenkraft, it shines heavily on a mostly instrumental album.\"A Nice Little Place\" is an ambient piece without as much going on as the other tracks. It's got a soft pad layer, an arpeggiated synth reminiscent of early sequenced Buchla patterns, reverb and delay on about everything heard, and small filter sweeps from various sounds.\"Mouse Eating Cheese\" is something incredibly similar to Shpongle's \"Nothing lasts, but nothing is lost\" album. The rhythms are very high pitched, clicky and treble heavy. Strings play a large role, and there's a continued use of male vocals. It's not one of my favorites, but it's one of the best produced tracks on the album and it's got that great Middle Eastern feel he's known for being able to put together.\"The Aubergine of the Sun\" is piece that really sounds a lot like \"Adrift in Hilbert Space\" due to the echoing guitar riffs in the beginning. It begins ambient and slowly moved back into a dub track after a sung vocoder track, which seems a little out of place for Ott. He makes it work though. After the rhythm is brought in something many Ott fans love, a completely indefinable instrument is brought in. There's a long slow-moving melody that sounds a bit like the odd vocal sounding melody line in \"The Queen of All Everything\" (Skylon), and another that is indefinable as a synth, a violin or a flute that's been altered. We get a bit of eastern-sound vocal chanting in the end before an ambient drop off. This is a very strong track, especially to end the album on.The album is worth getting for any dub fans, and hands down a must get for Ott fans. He ventures into new ideas while keeping true to his own sound, and I couldn't have asked for a better third album.\n", "val": 0.009537234902381897}
{"text": "Alright, everybody:Go listen to Ott and prepare to have your minds blown.Honestly, that could be the whole review right there. But I am so esteemed about this album that I simply want to tell you more about it. I want to explain to you its every little facet and nuance.And I want you to leave feeling as enamored about this album as I am. To deny you that would be an injustice. And I can tell you aren't really conviced yet.Fair enough.Ott is an electronic music producer associated with Brian Eno who is best known for being to create a kaleidescope of textures and soundscapes. I'm sure you hear the term musical journey thrown around often, but Mir truly encapsulates what an odyssey is all about.The opener, \"One Day I Wish to Have This Kind of Time,\" has a warm hypnotic feel underscoring an spoken word intro which lays out the album's central message - don't get too caught up in trying to analyze the what the music is all about; just chill out and let your mind soak it all in.That is followed by six minutes of cool Caribbean themed music with a nice beat and melody. You can practically feel the waves lapping over your bare feet.The followup track, \"Adrift in Hilbert Space,\" is perfectly representative of its title. It presents a very relaxed and chilled out vibe, as though you're floating along in space, while distant wispy vocals float alongside you.After that, prepare to descend to the depths of \"Owl Stretching Time,\" a darker, more sinister piece of electronica that at times threatens to veer into dubstep.There's plenty of other great musical ideas at play here later on. Psyched out Indian vocals, mellow, spacey guitar playing, and even lush underwater dreamscapes.It's very clear Ott is into psychedelia, but it's not overdone. Just enough of it to serve as a catalyst on this mystical and often wacked out journey that is known as Mir.Many artistic musical works have attempted to do what Mir does, but none have done it quite like Mir has - because it refuses to take itself seriously, and never gets bogged down by being too pretensions or artsy.Best of all, it never calls for an overwrought level of analysis or introspection. It simply is what it is. Now go buy the damn thing.\n", "val": 0.016464082524180412}

{"text": "This young lady has got some amazing vocal chops!  In this, her most recent album to date, Mandisa takes it up a notch.  What separates Mandisa from most other pop/R&B vocalists of today is her musicianship.  She doesn't indulge in long, meaningless vocal vamp runs designed to show off one's ability to perform vocal gymnastics (see: Beyonce, et. al.).  She hits her notes with both power and grace, but most of all, her vocal phrasing seems flawless.  I can almost guarantee that her voice will give you goosebumps at some point in this album.The songwriting and lyrics are also head and shoulders above the competition.  Her songs are very real, vulnerable, practical, and encouraging.  When was the last time you heard a song mention one's hatred for sit-ups, then turn that around and proclaim that nonetheless we can celebrate our difficult days?  First track to last, this album is fun to listen to, musically current, excellently produced, and inspirational.  If you've been a fan of Mandisa so far, this album will be a sure-fire hit for you.  If you've yet to check out her work, this would be a highly recommended place to start.Grade:  A = Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.03886919096112251}

{"text": "If you do not know the difference between being \"Religious\" and \"Spiritual\" this review probably will mean little to you; as you can be religious about anything, however, true spiritually depends upon a relationship. If you are looking for food to nourish your soul, look no further than Mandisa's album, \"What If It Were Real\".  You will be hard pressed to hear more edifying sermons that will bless the soul than what is presented within the messages of the powerfully anointed and uplifting (both in lyrics and performance) songs found within \"What If It Were Real\".  Far too many churches teach of a vengeful God: one just waiting to meat out punishment (a \"Whack-a-Sinner God - similar to the arcade game \"Whack-a-Mole\"). Our enemy, the father of lies, deceives so many into believing that they are alone and unworthy of Yahweh's (God's) love, mercy, provision and power. However, My Father is seeking His precious and beloved lost children in order to restore them to His Family and Kingdom.  I highly recommend the purchase of not one, but at least two of these albums so you may have one on hand and one to share with those you find in need.  May Yahweh abundantly and continuly bless Mandiesa and the writers of these powerful and anointed songs, not only in her/their amazing talant, but also for her/their steadfast conviction and dedication to providing substance over \"fluff\" for the encouragement the Body of Christ.\n", "val": 0.005499391350895166}

She is a great role model for young girls to look up to!With songs like \"Stronger\" and \" The Truth About Me\" Mandisa bears her soul to the listener and allows you to understand that even in the toughest times God is still there supporting us!\"Good Morning\" is one of my favorite songs. I have enjoyed Toby Mac in the past and this duet was perfectly matched.Overall, this is a great new album, but more than that, it is a great addition to Christian Contemporary Music today.

The album has a brand new feel to it, slightly different than her first 2 albums. Songs i like are: Good Morning (featuring my all time fav tobyMac), These Days, Free, and Lifeline. Lifeline in particular is a heavenly song equal to other popular church songs from mandisa's album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Freedom/dp/B001LK1LAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Freedom</a>, Not Guilty and Broken Hallelujah, and i can't wait till it comes out in soundtrack so i can sing it with my sister at church.Apart from all that i give the album 4 stars instead of 5 only because i feel like Mandisa has lost a little bit of her originality. In her first 2 albums she always usually had one song representing her African American heritage (That is: O my Lord from True Beauty, and Freedom's Song in Freedom) but this album did not have that. She also usually had 1 song from a previous Mary Mary album and this time she did not. I really missed those aspects of her music and i hope she brings them back.\n", "val": 4.842730413656682e-05}

{"text": "It's good, but it just doesn't seem to match exactly--it's not less \"chocolatey,\" though, nor bad-tasting (as those two elements would be when mixed together).  It would just take a couple of \"swigs\" to adjust the expectations with the results.  I love the Newsboys of their musical morphs over the last 20+ years; I loved dc Talk in their prime.  I loved the two groups' distinction during their great runs in the 90s--you weren't going to confuse who was who, even if you liked both.  When I heard that Michael was going on the road with the Newsboys, I figured his voice would match very nicely with their catalog and would be a good fit.  So I was quite excited to hear how it all would work in the studio and bought the new album on Tuesday.All of that being said, I didn't *love* this CD and feel bad for not doing so.  On paper, everything should work, and they do sound great; but they don't sound like the Newsboys.  I used this analogy to a friend, when describing the album:  it's like two cousins married and recorded an album....  Or something.  If you were hearing them for the first time--no knowledge of Peter Furler or Toby & Kevin--you'd probably rave about how \"adorable\" their \"kid\" is.  If you think about it too long, though, it seems odd.  Maybe I'm just being shallow and am hung up on the name of the group.  Maybe I am just going to have a difficult time moving on from Furler's so distinctive sound as lead singer.  Maybe I just got a bit nostalgic to hear the old dc Talk back in the game.But life moves on and so do the Newsboys and their music.  I have enjoyed listening several times since Tuesday but have not been blown away.  The songs are all good--no fillers or fluff--but I wasn't \"wowed\" by any one of them (for reference, \"Lead Me To The Cross\" and \"No Grave\" blew me away from the last CD, \"Something Beautiful\" and \"In Wonder\" from _Go_, and \"Stay Strong\" from their live concert disc).  \"Born Again,\" \"Running To You,\" \"When The Boys Light Up\" and \"Build Us Back\" stood out a bit from the pack.  I thought at least three of the tracks really echoed themselves musically, especially \"Born Again\" and \"One Shot.\"  I was really excited to hear them do \"Mighty To Save,\" but I was a bit underwhelmed--maybe just too high expectations.  I was also skeptical when I saw \"Jesus Freak\" as a title--they would have been far better just to leave that association alone and wait for some future anniversary/\"best of\" compilation to revisit the dc Talk catalog--just don't go there yet.  A reviewer on iTunes suggested that both tracks #11 and 12 be bonus tracks on a digital version, which sounds about right to me.Bottom Line:  Good, not great.  They really piqued my curiosity with the addition of Michael, and I bet it will ultimately work:  ten years from now (or even five), I might not remember Peter Furler or that Michael sang with dc Talk....\n", "val": 6.910327647347003e-05}
{"text": "Newsboys was one of the first Christian bands I listened to -- over 20 years ago.  They are long overdue for an overhaul.  This is the life they needed to continue to make good music.  And they certainly pulled through.  This is a GREAT album.  But don't be fooled into thinking it's like any other Newsboys CD you've ever heard.  You can definitely hear the Tait twist on this album.  While Tait was never my favorite solo artist, he was great with DC Talk.  He is once again great with the backing of a new band.  And, really, you must think of it as a new band.  Keeping the Newsboys name was simply for marketing a well-known product.  But this is not the Newsboys as we've known them . . . thankfully.\n", "val": 0.010684466920793056}
{"text": "Born Again covers a pretty wide gamut and is clearly tuned to Michael Tait's vocal style.  Why should this be a surprise, and what's wrong with that?  Countless well known bands have made vocalist changes, adapted their style accordingly, and continued to put out quality stuff.Born Again is definitely a \"poppier\" album than prior projects - worth getting in that genre for the title track, One Shot, and Light Up.  If you like something a little edgier, Escape and Miracles may appeal.  Way Beyond Myself is the most sugary track, but one that has a way of sticking in your head.  Running to You and On Your Knees are more melodic but catchy and reminiscent to me of some of Tait's solo material.  Covers of Mighty to Save and Jesus Freak are okay, but add nothing terribly innovative.I've been listening to several of these tracks for months now, and still enjoying them.  Same can be said for my teenage kids.  The music spans a wide variety, is enjoyable, and well done.  The \"Newsboys are Dead\" crowd need to move along...and try listening to the album before critiquing it.\n", "val": 0.010609855875372887}

{"text": "Nothing personal, the Newsboys have been cranking it out for some time now.  Frankly, their last half a dozen efforts have been stale, repetitive, and cliche' in a CCM industry that's largely founded on such things.  It remains to be seen if Tait's hiring is anything more than a desperate grab at publicity. For now I remain unconvinced that this has the makings of any dramatic new movements in contemporary gospel music.These guys have talent, that's not really in question.  The issue is whether or not these are worthy \"offerings\", or simply product to be consumed by a willing populace.  Even Audio Adrenaline knew there came a time to call it a day...Then again, people had The Newsboys buried when John James left.  That either speaks to the devotion (and perhaps selective deafness) of the band's diehard fanbase, or the sad state of CCM.There are so many more talented musicians and bands trying to share their faith in moving, heartfelt, and creatively significant ways.  When albums like \"Born Again\" continue to get made, it only makes it harder for the newer voices to be heard.\n", "val": 2.82015298580518e-05}
{"text": "When it was announced that Peter Furler was leaving the Newsboys, it would have been perfectly normal for the band to hang up the towel.  They had an accomplished career under their belts, (though Furler was the only remaining founding member) selling millions of records and playing hundreds of concerts.The Newsboys had definitely evolved.  They went from a post hair metal 80's rock band to a rock/pop outfit.  Recently, the band changed so much, they lost their identity.  First, they lost guitarist Jody Davis after Adoration.  Then Phil Joel made his exit after GO.  Their replacements: Bryan Oleson and Paul Coleman.  Neither man quite fit in with the band, and they both left after a few years.Then the band's brain and heartbeat, Peter Furler, announced he was leaving.  When the news of his replacement was broken to me through a friend, I flat out did not believe him.  Michael Tait.  A darling of the CCM community who had enjoyed just as much \"stardom\" in his band, DC Talk.  There could not have been a more obvious attempt to rescue the band from doom then to have an equally popular frontman right the ship.  If it had been anyone else beside Tait, the Newsboys would have dropped in popularity like Tiger Woods.Though Tait has in a sense rescued the band from dying, he brings his own element to the band: Michael Tait.  In short, without the Steve Taylor/Peter Furler two headed monster guiding the songwriting, the Newsboys have matured into an irrelevant band.  Instead of owning their identity, (think mid 90's to early 00's) they have destroyed their legacy.  They are now on their third lead singer, and are making their worst music since the 80's, back when John James was still at the helm.Ladies and Gentlemen, the Newsboys have died.  Michael Tait now leads a ragtag group of men still trying to make Newsboys music.  These are not the Newsboys.  When Furler left, it was best to R.I.P.\n", "val": 1.7440332158003002e-05}

{"text": "Once again Mandisa puts together an extraordinary album with spirit-lifting messages based upon Scripture...The album starts off HURTLING with the hyper-encouraging\"Stronger\"which conveys that God is indeed purging/\"making\"us through the\"HOT\"/trying times which beset us,in the same maner in which fire is used as a\"tool\"to TEMPER steel!! I listen to this(loudly)at least seven times everyday to remind me that the\"heat\"of my trying situations is actually/only a HELP to me!! \"What If We Were Real\"touches on the idea of us unashamedly dropping that \"invulnerable\"stoic facade many wear to appear so very confident/\"strong\"and nonchalant during fiery trials,and  to simply acknowledge that long trials DO hurt/take an emotional toll on us..The hyper-astonishing\"Just Cry\"continues with the issue of shamelessly displaying ones hurt during a lengthy,fiery spiritual trial as it is Gods' central,intentional PURPOSE to bring us to tears,on our knees/\"break\"us of our indepedent nature,during our\"test-runs on His spiritual\"proving-grounds\"so that we'll come to depend SOLELY upon Him to supply our every need!!While the saint who is on the OUTside looking IN,may become judgemental and interpret anothers tears as merely\"shameful self-pity\" So He actually \"expects\"us TO cry as a result of this,just as Mandisa conveys with:\"You gotta know God can handle your\"honesty\";so FEEL the things you're feeling..name your fears and doubts..\" Mandisa then EMPHATICALLY(and very truthfully declares:\"It doesn't MEAN you don't TRUST Him;it DOESN'T mean you DON'T believe;it DOESN'T mean you don't KNOW He's redeeming EVERYthing!!\" This portion of the song is SO very INTENSE that I feel out-of-breath/emotionally\"spent\"by songs' end!!  \"These Days\"is an EXCELLENT concept that we can actually\"learn\"to\"like\"/appreciate the\"valley-experience\"with its character-building potential WHILE we're going through it,FOR  the heat-tested purity it will bring OUT of us!! This is admitedly a hard attitude to attain,but AFTER its' job is done,we WILL one day look BACK and appreciate\"those days\"for the spiritual perfection they worked in us!! \"The Truth About Me\"is a beautiful ballad which touches on how a lot of believers fail to understand exactly WHAT took place in/with them when they accepted His gift of redemption!! The average saint believes themselves NOT as a  totally NEW creation,but merely as a\"rebuilt\"SINNER!! So here Mandisa muses on what an astonishing change of perspective the believer would attain,IF they were cognizant of...the TRUTH about themselves!!  \"Say Goodbye\"is completely VICTORIOUS in its'asessment that Blood-bought believers can bid a FINAL,irrevocable\"FAREWELL\"to the wicked conduct and wrong thinking of the person they WERE before Christ saved them..\"Free\"explores the pith of what becoming a Child of the Most High God  essentially means,as it declares the believer actually being impowered/enabled to RESIST/successfully defy the tremendous\"pull\"of Sin,as a result of King Jesus setting them FREE from the very desire to partake in sinful conduct!! makes a good point as she says:I tried and tried and tried,to make this mountain\"step aside\"or try to climb it on MY own..THEY say:\"I'll never make it\",they say:\"YOU can never change it\"(which is actually TRUE,since it takes Christs' power to SHATTER our fetters of sin)\"what you ARE is what you'll ALWAYS be!!\"  Sad but true because withOUT turning ones life over to Him,the Enemy has one a helpless SLAVE to sin!! A  powerful(and Scriptually accurate)line of this song repeats:\"Who the Son SETS free;you'd BEST believe is free INDEED!!\" \"Lifeline\"is a beautiful ballad recognizing exactly WHAT He is to the believer who is expriencing a momentuous struggle to surive through the emotional neutercanes  which life sends their way...\n", "val": 0.006751081440597773}

I listen to it every single day when I'm walking and it has gotten me from walking just next door and back all the way up to 4 miles. It gives me the hope and strength I need to refocus on what is most important. Every single song has a message. I would highly encourage you to visit Mandisa's official youtube page so you can watch videos she has made explaining the message behind each song. I can't even pick a favorite b/c each one is beautiful and meaningful in its own way. If you are struggling in your life then I believe you will find hope here. It is much more than just a music CD. It is something that will speak to your heart and renew your spirit. When I saw this go on sale today, I immediately gifted it to a friend who is going through her own personal struggle right now. This CD will take you on a journey and the more you listen to it, the more it will spur you on towards understanding God's love for you. I feel very grateful that I stumbled upon this CD although in reality I believe God led me to it at the right time when I really needed something to uplift me as I began my weight loss journey. I made a video of my weight loss journey using Mandisa's song \"Waiting for Tomorrow\" as the theme song.  Mandisa actually saw the video and not only did she personally respond to it with an encouraging message but she posted it to her facebook page.  I think that says a lot about who she is as a person. I believe she genuinely cares about making an impact in the world for God.

You might think that I'm just young, that's not the case. I'm in my 40's and I love Christian dance music, I love Tae Bo, and I love praise and worship.This album has a lot of dance music on it. I found that this is a great album to work out to and to get in shape. You are challenged not to get up on your feet and let loose with this album! There is one song that slows down a bit and that's Glorious. I really love this song.All of these songs aren't just dance tunes, they go back to the basics of Christianity. If you listen to the words they are all pointing people to Jesus. They are all testifying of God. Some are evangelistic reminding people that you only have \"One Shot\" to make an impression on someone and then it's gone. They remind us of our constant witness to others around us.I love this album and would even recommend it to those who aren't Christian but love dance music. I think this is a great witnessing disc.

The first 15 songs are the same as the deluxe edition of the first release with the exception of track 4. On the origonal release the song was \"Impossible\" but on this version it is replaced by the more upbeat \"Save Your Life\". The album opens with the best song \"Born Again\". This song really shows the new direction Newsboys are heading in and it is a completely new energy for the band. The only downside I could see would be the fact I'm not a huge fan of the remixes, I prefer the origionals.

I've been Born Again.\"The Newsboys are back. 25 years and 14 albums after their debut, the Newsboys have found a way to mold and change their style. Michael Tait (dc Talk, Tait Band) joined the band in 2009 as the new lead singer. Born Againis their first album with the new front man.Their new upbeat rock style in the title track sets the tone for the rest of the songs. The song inspires repentance in Christian's lives. It talks about giving everything up for Jesus and taking on His identity. It uses a small glimpse of the prodigal son story, where the son chooses to go and walk alone and fails miserably. The son comes alive and is \"Born Again\" once he returns to his father.The next track, \"Way Beyond Myself,\" has a more pop feel, even using some auto tune in it. Again this song is about giving into something way beyond yourself. This track speaks of God supernatural power to calm, heal, and use our lives for His purposes.\"One Shot\" continues where \"Born Again\" stopped. The rock-filled song has many pauses and breaks giving a sense of anticipation throughout. The verses of the song speak of things that our generation does everyday.\"Things change. Just like the Twitter that you update or your Facebook status on your front page. But there's no comment you can leave to change my mind.\"It is a song about standing up for the Faith no matter what is hot.The album finally slows a little with \"Impossible.\" It is a simple song about God's personality and strengths. It uses Philippians 4:13. \"I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.\"With Michael Tait joining an already very establish band in 2009, the Newsboys needed a new recognizable ballad. \"When the Boys Light Up\" is that ballad. The song is entirely about the Newsboys coming back and giving all the praise to God.The album takes a few twists over the next four tracks. The Newsboys recorded the modern worship hit, \"Mighty to Save\" for the eleventh track on the album.Finally, \"Jesus Freak\" finishes off the more rock songs. CCM Magazine ranked it number two of 100 Greatest Christian songs of all time in 2006. Originally written and performed by Tait's band, dc Talk. \"Jesus Freak\" has been covered three other times.This album is a great step for the \"new\" Newsboys to continue the legacy of one of the greatest Christian bands of all time.\n", "val": 0.0001011394924717024}

With 20 quality tracks at a currently great price, this is an *excellent* way to experience the new direction.A few highlights...\"Born Again\"-  As soon as I saw the video for this on youtube I was hooked. This band has been involved with building projects in Baja Mexico, and it fits *greatly* with the music video and song. Beautiful place; beautiful people.\"Save Your Life\"- Takes the place of \"Impossible\" on the 1st release. Excellent.\"Miracles\"- Tait rocks it here. I can see why they created a video and remix.\"Jesus Freak\"- A nice blast from the past with a twist. I like it.\"Way Beyond Myself\"- 2 solid versions, original and Flatline remix. It's the very deserving remix contest winner.... And I can *easily* add more to this list. I hesitated to get the 1st Born Again CD- this newer edition is fantastic! While Peter will always be the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/quintessential/dp/B000WM72I4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">quintessential</a>&nbsp;Newsboys leader to me, Tait brings a fresh, new vocal dynamic that I believe will likely increase the appeal & impact of the Newsboys' message over time. It's a radical change, to be sure, but I'm thinking it works! And it's not like Peter can never make another Newsboys appearance. If Duran Duran can return, and Mick Jagger is still performing, I'm thinking *anything's* possible with Peter. :) We'll see!P.S. And then this...

They would have gone out as legends, instead they have become a parody. When Peter was in the band his voice was able to introduce you to God and Jesus.  The new vocalist, well he just... should I say it.... Lacks Spirit. Now I'm sure this review is going to spawn hate replies and rebukes. Oh well. I speak the truth of my opinion.

I like Tait - as Tait. But don't sell me this as the Newsboys when it ain't. And you can't compare the new transition from Peter Furler to Michael Tait as lead singer to the old transition from John James to Peter Furler as the lead singer.

I heard Born Again on the radio, and did some research into the Newsboys.  Sure enough, it was Michael Tait!  Soon after, I bought the album, and have been impressed.Musically, it's a good album. I had heard that the old singer has moved to a production role;  Great move!  I hear shades of Owl City on one song, some hip-hop flavor in another, all out rock music in yet another.  Miracles, Born Again, and One Shot can rock with Muse, Pearl Jam, and other secular groups.  Lyrically, the slow songs have enough depth to keep you thinking about your faith.  The quality of this album far surpasses most Christian music today.One gripe is that the styles change so much.  Are they rock?  Hip Hop?  The change can be confusing.  I tend to shy away from the hip hop stuff, myself.  Another is that the last 2 songs are remakes.  Did we really need another Jesus Freak?All in all, this album represents what's good about Christian music for me.

{"text": "To explain my title, I did not in any way mean that they needed salvation;  I have always been impressed with the lyrical quality of the Newsboys. What I mean is that the band seemed to be stuck in the 90's and was becoming increasing irrelevant in today's Christian music culture.  Michael Tate has brought the Newsboys to the 21st century with a new sound that, quite frankly, I love a lot more than the stereotypical 90's praise that the boys have been churning out for a while.  Below is a review of each individual track on the Born Again STANDARD EDITION cd, or you can just skip to the bottom for a general review:1. Born Again - 9.5/10 - The title track, and also the first single from the CD, is nearly flawless, combining a catchy pop-rock sound with good lyrics. I can't honestly say they're GREAT lyrics, I've heard more explicitly spiritual ones before, even on this album, but the message is still evident and makes for a great first track.2. One Shot - 10/10 - One of my favorite tracks off of this CD, One Shot proclaims that believers should always proclaim their love for God, no matter what the circumstance. As many have pointed out, after a while this song will become dated due to its references to Facebook and Twitter [\"Things change, just like the Twitter that you update, or the Facebook status on your front page, but there's no comment you can leave to change my mind...\"].3. Way Beyond Myself - 9/10 - A little more pop than rock, this song sounds gorgeous but leaves a little to be desired lyrically. Although dripping with religious metaphor, you'll have to listen closely to hear the actual reference to the Lord in the chorus.4. Impossible - 6/10 - The first slower song of the CD, the sound is okay but while the lyrics are empowering, a unbeliever might miss the Christianese in them.5. When the Boys Light Up - 9/10 - A fun pop rock anthem, this songs is reminiscent of a 90's boy band sound, but still expertly produced and lyrically sound, although still mostly metaphoric.6. Build Us Back - 9/10 - Perhaps my favorite worship song on the album, Build Us Back is a simple yet elegant song about relying on God to build us up when we endure hardships in life.7. Escape - 7/10 - Bringing us back to the Newsboys' new rock element with a bang, Escape is a really fun rock song with really generic lyrics. While it sounds cool, it almost seems like a distraction from the fact the lyrics in this song have almost no substance to them.8. Miracles - 10/10 - Another one of my favorites from this album, this track is a powerful rock anthem that is another great testament to the impeccable production values instilled in this album.  Some Newsboys fans will still be disappointed with the lack of an actual reference to God, but He is still quite evident in the lyrics [\"You got me up from down, faith has shattered my doubt, I believe in miracles\"].9. Running to You - 10/10 - Another great worship song with very explicitly Christian lyrics [\"More than just emotion, my broken heart has chosen, Jesus I'm running to You...\"]10. On Your Knees - 9/10 - The final original song on Born Again, On Your Knees examines the journey of a young woman searching for salvation. It never tells of the woman actually accepting Christ, but it does lay out a fairly clear salvation message.11. Mighty to Save - 8/10 - The only reason this gets as low as a rating of 8 from me is because the Hillsong original has been redone so many times, so many ways that it's just starting to get old.  The Newsboys actually did a fantastic job with this upbeat worship track, just wish they could have chosen something a little more unique.12. Jesus Freak w/ KJ-52 - 10/10 - Many people have scrutinized this track unduly simply because it's a remake of the much-revered dcTalk hit.  Here's my version: I actually like the flow of this version better than the original.  When comparing the two songs, there are some aspects that sound better than the original, while  others can completely ruin the song for diehard dcTalk fans. I will admit that KJ-52's rendition of TobyMac's raps leave something to be desired from the original, but at the same time it is a fresh take which is delivered at the top of his game. It simply depends on your perspective.Overall, I really like the \"reborn\" Newsboys. More rock, less 90's pop. Unfortunately, the lyrics did suffer some on this album, probably in an effort to appeal to a wider audience, although the message of Christ is still clearly communicated if you take the album as a whole. One thing that struck me when I was listening to the album's fourth track was that Michael Tate's voice seems to be better suited for rock than contemporary worship. No one can deny that Tate is very talented and has a unique voice, but on the approximately 50% of the album that's targeted toward the CCM crowd, his voice seems to be a bit out of place, a bit too powerful, if you will, for the genre. I wonder if the Newsboys' next album will be more focused on the rock aspect of their rebirth.\n", "val": 0.008355061523616314}

{"text": "(Note: This is a review of the \"Deluxe Edition\" of the album available on iTunes, which has four extra tracks. Some of the songs mentioned will be from that version of the album.)When Peter Furler announced his departure from the Newsboys, fans speculated who would take over as frontman for the popular CCM band. The choice: none other than Michael Tait, former member of the bands D.C. Talk and Tait! The choice proved to be a perfect one. Although the sound for Newsboys is a little different with \"Born Again,\" they still provide an awesome batch of songs in praise of our Creator! The standouts on the album include the Title Track, \"On Your Knees,\" their cover of the songs \"Mighty to Save\" and \"Jesus Freak,\" and the powerful ballads \"Give Me to You\" and \"I'll Be.\" While there are a couple of missteps, \"Born Again\" is a terrific album, and proof that even a change in frontman won't stop this band from creating powerful songs for God! A terrific CCM album that I cannot help but highly recommend!Grade: A-\n", "val": 0.04574010893702507}
{"text": "I like the newsboys.  I've listened to them for over half my life, and while many other bands have come and gone, many with different styles and approaches to Christian music, the newsboys have consistently made good music, a style that makes you happy and let's you dance around to the music (not to mention whistle).  While this album is good and I have listened to it many times, I just don't feel that same attraction to this band with the changes that have occurred.To begin with, the album's title and opening track is fantastic.  I love this song, and play it over again.  The next song isn't horrible, but then you hit \"Way Beyond Myself\" and \"Impossible\" are fun songs, the former of which reminds me of \"Something Beautiful\" and the latter is a different sound that I really enjoy.  The next song, \"When the Boys Light Up\", is good, but for some reason, I just don't like it as much as if Peter had been singing it.  The next few songs are okay, but not great, and while others may not like the last two, I enjoy the \"Mighty to Save\" and \"Jesus Freak\" covers.There are other bonus songs offered by the competition, one of which is \"I'll Be\", which should have been included on the album over \"Build Us Back\", as it is a much better song.  All in all, the album is good, and I believe if you're a casual Christian music or newsboys fan, you'll enjoy it.  However, I just miss that silly Australian madness behind the newsboys, and I think it'll take another album for me to get used to this change.  Some people compare this change to when Peter Furler became the singer over John James, but then it was much harder to tell.  They sounded the same, and the style of music didn't change amazingly.  This change is much more severe, and it takes a while to get used to.I will say, though, that you should really check these guys out in concert.  While I may not like the album a whole lot, I sure do like their shows, and have been to three since Tait became the front man.  It's a can't miss in Christian music.\n", "val": 0.013882783241569996}

{"text": "I have to admit that when I heard that Peter Furler was stepping away and that Michael Tait would be the new Newsboys frontman, I did a double-take. Not because I don't like Tait -- I think he has a fabulous voice and have liked his solo stuff since the dc Talk days -- but because it seemed about as drastic a change in a lead singer as a band could make. While I like Furler's singing, what really stood out to me was his 'showmanship', the way he would interact with the crowd as they sang along with some of the most lyrical quips imaginable (thanks in large part to song-writer extraordinaire, Steve Taylor).As much as I have liked the Newsboys (especially 'Step Up To The Microphone' & 'Thrive'), I must admit that I have lost interest over the last few years as they have been a part of the 'recycled worship' movement that has yielded some nice takes on existing songs, but very little creativity and 'newness' (as in 'Microphone' & 'Thrive'). The Newsboys have been one of my fave bands to see in concert, because they had so much energy and Furler's 'showmanship', but the last few CD's have seemed to lack the creativity and 'punch' that their earlier stuff had.Enter Michael Tait. While I agree that this CD really doesn't sound like the (early) Newsboys, I feel that it IS an improvement over what they had been slowly drifting into. 'Born Again' carries more energy & emotion, and the title couldn't be more appropriate considering the transformation they are undergoing. I have always liked Peter Furler, but I didn't feel like the last few Newsboys projects had really captured that swagger that he had shown on the early projects and in concert.Here is a few thoughts on the 'Born Again' CD:1: BORN AGAIN -- it certainly doesn't take long to hear the difference in the Newsboys, as they start off with a no-nonsense rocker that is lyrically 'up-front' and tailored to Tait's singing style. A very bold song to begin this new era, which obviously refers to the new life one has in Christ, but also to the new life (symbolically) that both Tait and the Newsboys have with this new direction. 10/102: ONE SHOT -- I like this song for the very reason that some on here have dissed it -- the fact that it refers to Twitter & FaceBook. While it does date the music, it is also very relevant to the here and now, much like the lyrics that KJ-52 has in some of his songs. Another very up-front song with lyrical boldness, this one is very easy to sing along with.  7/103: WAY BEYOND MYSELF -- I like the dance feel this song has, and it again exemplifies the variety and wide range of music that Tait can sing with. I usually prefer good rockers, but I really like the unique sound of this song and find myself repeating it quite often. 9/104: IMPOSSIBLE -- another very good song, but to me it is not as strong as most of the other songs. Great message and lyrics (as with all the other songs), but nothing really makes this song stand out like most of the rest. 6/105: WHEN THE BOYS LIGHT UP -- now this could be a Peter Furler song! The style of this song is so Furler, and yet it describes the very 'coming together' of Tait and the Newsboys. Very creative song and is very hard to get out of your head (and that's a good thing). 9/106: BUILD US BACK -- although it is slow, I really like the message and the way it 'builds' as the song unwinds. great set-up for the next couple of songs on the CD. 8/107: ESCAPE -- Here is the song that I am bound and determined to wear out! The lyrical genius of Steve Taylor and a straight-ahead hard rocking sound that deals with a topic that is seldom dealt with -- dealing with temptation. There is no doubt that this is NOT the old Newsboys, as it has a great edge to it. 10/108:  MIRACLES -- After an opening that either annoys you or hooks you, this song has a very chunky sound that carries you along as it rocks. As with all the other songs on this CD, the lyrics are refreshingly BOLD and do not hold back. This song continues the musical momentum carried over from 'Escape' and is another rocking hit. 10/109: RUNNING TO YOU -- My favorite slow song on the CD -- one of the best on this collection. \"Running\" continues the momentum built by the previous two tracks and makes this trio the best stretch on the CD. 10/1010: ON YOUR KNEES -- Very good song, but a little cliche in my opinion. Great song regarding the power of prayer and need for it. 7/1011: MIGHTY TO SAVE -- This is one of my favorite praise songs, and I like the spin the band puts on it. It is indeed a little 'heavier' with more emphasis on the guitar. A new take on a well-known song. 7/1012: JESUS FREAK -- A remake of a classic, which is almost always a recipe for disaster. It really sounds much like the original, and I am a big KJ-52 fan so I like the rap, but I miss the heavier feel of the original, especially with the screeching guitar near the end of the song. While this version is very very good, it seems like the jagged edges are a little rounded off. 8/10Overall, I think the quality is top-notch and I really like the boldness of the lyrics -- strong Christian witness without being overbearing or sappy-sweet. As much as I have liked Peter Furler (and still do!), there is no doubt in my mind that Michael Tait is a superior singer who has a much broader range, enabling the Newsboys to be even more diverse now. Every song is very good to great, with the 'Escape-Miracles-Running To You' trio taking best show, along with the title track. A very solid start to what is a very unique band transformation -- I look forward to what lies ahead for the Newsboys as they move forward . . . .\n", "val": 0.001854856382124126}

The words are honest and glorifying God in acknowledging that our power is through His mighty hand and not our own and that He lifts us up to more than what we can imagine.  You can definitely see where these artists hearts are with the Lord and it is refreshing.

{"text": "I've been a fan of the \"Oi Boys\" since the early 90's and when I heard Furler was stepping out I knew the newsboy I had known and loved were essentially leaving with him. Then when I discovered that the band was not quitting and that Tait was taking the helm I was extremely skeptical but a little excited to see and hear what the \"new\" Newsboys would sound like. I was scared that the CD would essentially be Tait's third release (which I wouldn't have minded if it were actually titled Tait). One bit of news that kept me ever hopeful was that Peter Furler would be heavily involved in the writing and producing of the album to help keep their sound distinctly Newsboys. Now that the CD is out I am both pleased and disappointed (but mostly pleased). The biggest disappointment for me was not the bands sound, its good rock with definitely some Newsboys flavor, it is the total lack of Furler even behind the scenes. This absence is clearly felt and while this CD does indeed have a Newsboys \"flavor\" its definitely its own entity and feels more like a new Tait CD. This disappoint aside the CD itself is very good. The original songs are catchy and fun and MOST of the lyrics are solid (facebook/twitter references notwithstanding). The two cover songs that close out the CD aren't bad but aren't very innovative. The \"Jesus Freak\" cover could have been so much better if Tait and the guys had actually made it their own. KJ-52 is no Toby but his rap is as solid anyone could have done. It will certainly be interesting to see what the future holds for this group but I know I will certainly grab their next release.\n", "val": 0.003605868434533477}
{"text": "\"Born Again\" is Australian Christian Rock group Newsboys first CD since their new vocalist Michael Tait joined, and immediately it is evident the group sounds more like his alma mater dc Talk, or even Tait. No bad thing if you loved the sound of those acts, but I can't help feeling this doesn't sound much like Newsboys.Still, it is a good album. Opening is the title track, a quivering rocker which is very catchy and one of my favourites. Other upbeat songs of that ilk are \"One shot\" (which name checks twitter and facebook), \"Way beyond myself\" (which has a Trancey dance feel), the catchy \"When the boys light up\" (sounding like something by Tait's former band mate Toby Mac), the frenetic rocker \"Escape\", and the bouncy Glam rock \"Miracles\". The band cover \"Jesus Freak\" which I find redundant as it is almost a note for note copy of the dc Talk original but lacking in the punch that packed when first heard back in 1995.The rest of the album comprises mid-tempo songs or ballads; \"Impossible\", the anthemic restoration ballad \"Build us back\", \"Running to you\" (another of my favourites), the jangly \"On your knees\" (\"When you lose hope, all you have to do is get on your knees again\"), and \"Mighty to save\", a cover of a Hillsong song.There isn't any bad cut among these, but also nothing spectacular either, my favourites notwithstanding. None of the quirky fun Pop present on albums like \"Going public\" or \"Take me to your leader\". I hope they take more musical risks next time and create a stronger identity for themselves rather than sounding like dc Talk/Tait clones. A newcomer to Newsboys may love this though. 3 and a half stars really!\n", "val": 0.007530186790972948}

{"text": "Facedown Records released this sampler in time for their April 8 & 9 Facedown Fest in Pomona, California. According to Wikipedia 'Facedown is a Christian Record Label featuring Christian & Secular Bands'. Many sound pretty good.Track 1 Gideon playing Virtue. Cool music behind metal vocal grinding and peaking on this opening track. Nice.Your Memorial play Surface next. Similar vocal sound to Gideon better harmonies & better sound behind the real singer. Song breaks out into excellent rock track as the singer and band overwhelm the metal vocal. This is a great song.Track 3 is My Epic with Lower Still. Neat opening to great song. This is a very cool metal song neat vocal harmonies over 'wall of noise' and some intelligible lyrics.Transcend by Hope For The Dying. Another song that overcomes the metal vocals and soars featuring nice guitar work great singing drums and sound. 7+ minute track gives you time for mellow and harsh moments. Like it.Track 5 is Devastator by For Today. Early neat clean guitar sound over metal vocal descends into metal and metal that is disjointed and raw. Vocals with a obvious message don't help.Messengers play Anthems next. Starts w/frantic playing over jerky singer. The track slows and dies along with the singers groaning. Shame.The War Within Us from Onward To Olympas. In your face metal vocal partners w/strong band. Metal vocal was nearly too much for me until soaring singer joins in and competes with that voice. Song wins.Track 8 War Of Ages w/Collapse. Neat opening then metal vocal immediately at war with true singing. Lively band some neat in your face voice great harmonies strong playing, lyrics probably have a message song outweighs all. Great track.A Hope For Home play The Overman. Nothin' fancy then non metal singer joins in (again). More cool vocal over metal vocal and bashing band. I am detecting a pattern here start with classic metal vocal then bring in cool rock vocalist on some of these tracks.Track 10 Empty Promises by Call To Preserve. Classic 2+ minutes of Metal.The Hands play 6 minutes of Resistance. Slow lightweight metal over deliberate lyrics. Band wakes up slows down singer keeps speaking. Song restarts at 3 minutes, the second half sounds the same.Overcome with Alone in a Crowd. Vicious vocal over punchy band becomes drain vocal over same band.Track 13 And Weep by A Plea For Purging. More of an intestinal vocal than previous tracks. Active band. Not for me.Next up Defamator by Take It Back. Fast punkish sound 97 seconds of metal action great song.In The Midst Of Lions play The Machine. Nothing special here. Metal vocal same sound.Track 16 Burial playing Demons Never Sleep. Could the song title be a warning to us w/rapid metal playing behind metal vocals sounding the same, perhaps Demons never sleep?Last track All, But The Archer by Saving Grace. Throat clearing intro by the vocalist leading to more of the same. Band zooms along but can't redeem the track even with weird chorus spoken words and pauses later in the song.This is a good sampler. Started better faded at the end. Some neat songs couple of great tracks. From what I could understand much of the content suffers usual tendency of this genre of limited lyrical imagination.

{"text": "Randy wasn't sure from the beginning how his dad convinced him to take a summer job. Let alone in the same place where he worked. Randy wasn't an Agent like Dad. He was only working as a Level 0. Besides it being a top secret lab, he was still just a janitor.Often, he saw a monkey in a lab coat running through the halls (Dad said to stay the Hell away from it; one of the few times he ever looked scared). Once, he saw one of the scientists holding a camcorder and following a six-foot-tall thing with eight legs and four arms; he hoped it was some kind of robot even though it didn't move like one. And he really wondered why they let that one man walk around in nothing but a bathrobe even though everyone looked like they hated him.All of this, Randy saw while cleaning the floors or emptying the garbage cans. And then there was that tree. Though it creeped him out, he liked being in its courtyard because he could at least see the sky there. He had the job of cleaning up what came out of one side of the tree. He especially didn't like doing that. The smell alone was terrible, and it steamed up his glasses so that he had to keep cleaning them, leaving him almost completely blind.Randy really really wanted to know what Dad was thinking, putting him through this. Even though he got to see a lot of weird stuff, it was a totally crap job.Meanwhile, in another part of the same site, a member of the administrative staff was speaking to an Agent.\"Agent Foxtrot, I'm glad that I managed to speak to you at last.\"\"I'm always available to speak to a superior, Sir.\"\"I was looking through the site's personnel roster and I noticed a strange discrepancy. For some reason, I saw your name listed twice. One as an Agent, and one as a Level 0 worker.\"\"Yes, Sir. This is correct.\"\"I also noticed that the lower ranked Randy Foxtrot is somehow assigned to aid in maintaining an anomalous object, despite being Level 0. And I assume that you had something to do with this. Is that also correct?\"\"Yes, Sir. Is there anything else?\"\"Damn right, there's something else! I demand an explanation!\"\"May I speak candidly, Sir?\"\"If that gives me an explanation, then yes.\"\"Well, Sir, I'm sure you know that I'm going to retire in about a year. After that, the Foundation becomes nothing more than a memory. I wanted to leave this place with one less regret. That's all. I had to pull in a lot of favours for this to happen. The boy is still going to be given amnesics after this is all over. And I bet that my last year with the Foundation is going to be pure Hell. But I had to do it.\"\"All this. Sacrificing the rest of your career and risking your pension. Just for him. Why?\"\"I raised Junior from when he was an infant. I love him like a son. I feel proud every time he calls me Dad, even though I know it's not the truth. I wanted to do this last thing for him while I still could. I wanted, just once, for him to meet his real father.\"As Randy began to leave the courtyard, one of the tree's branches bent down in front of his face. The eyeballs at each tip hovered mere inches away from him, seeming to take in every feature. The branch, looking so much like an arm, then reached for his head and tousled his hair? After that, the branch once again pointed back up to the sky. This place is weird.\n", "val": 3.75351301045157e-05}

{"text": "As cheesy as a bowl of Mac N' Cheese smothered in cheese sauce with crumbled up Cheesedoodles on top, Bowling for Soup is back with their 11th full length album. Admittedly, I've mentioned them in multiple discussions about what bad pop punk sounds like, but it's also fair to note that this album marks the first time thepaintedman has spent any good deal of time listening to the cheese soaked tunes by Jaret Reddick and crew.Removing his foot from his mouth, I am ready to admit that he was (at least partially) wrong about Bowling for Soup being what's wrong with modern pop punk. Does this mean they aren't cheesier than Chester covered in Cheez Wiz? No, it does not. However, unlike their contemporaries that actually are what's wrong with pop punk music, BFS is wholly self-aware of what they are, seemingly embracing the art of writing tunes that they enjoy writing and simply not caring what the elitist bastards (like myself) think.Once one can admit that being cool doesn't really matter, it's not too hard to hear that BFS is actually pretty good. A group of good musicians that write fun songs rather than artsy pap for the Brooklyn elite can actually be refreshing.

The guys are finally able to put out a product that they have total control over and it shows. Their 1st single \"Turbulence\" is a sure fire top 40 hit which will bring in a whole new group of fans to appreciate what i've known about for 12 years.

Look for the video soon!3) Guard My Heart - The lost BFS song, newly recorded. Written by Erik. In a perfect world this would be the second top ten hit on this record.

You can get a feel for the sound (as well as a sense of whether or not you will enjoy it) by listening to the previews on Amazon--since the pieces are short, what you'll hear there is pretty much what you'll get.If you are interested in doing a deeper dive into similar material, I've published a list of \"position music\" and \"trailer music\" in Amazon's Listmania.\n", "val": 0.00038995276554487646}

{"text": "You know, there's a certain type of new music chart that needs to be created, and it would be based entirely upon the count of YouTube views that a given music video generates within its first few weeks of release -- with another chart (a derivative of the above) based strictly upon the velocity of weekly change. YouTube view counts, I have noticed, are something of a precursor for singles that break quickly -- the astonishing speeds that we see today on Billboard's Hot 100 for rising monster tracks are almost always indicated in advance by insanely large numbers of views at YouTube: Nicki Minaj, for example, has 52 Million views for Super Bass in a bit under 5 weeks (Billboard has the track at #5 inside of 5 weeks, too, which is incredible... especially considering that her prior single barely cracked the Top 15); Katy Perry has 40 Million views for Last Friday Night in 3 weeks (Billboard had Katy at #4 inside of those same 3 weeks on the big chart, which is also an incredible surge)... you get the idea. Gaga, Britney, Dev/Cataracts, Adele, Jennifer Lopez, etc... all have shown this same early power at YouTube with their biggest -- and fastest-rising -- singles.What's my point...?It's this:Britney's VEVO channel has the video for I Wanna Go at 14 Million views inside of a week. That implies a very quick ride to the top, but we'll see. A chart for YouTube views is badly needed -- my sample size is far too small, of course, to pronounce this as an obvious #1 title, although it certainly looks like this one is going to be a monster of a record. Jesus, they even clocked it dead at 3:30 -- what else can you ask for...?!! It's about as radio-friendly as a unit can get.I Wanna Go is probably the single best thing that Spears has ever put together, which isn't necessarily saying much. A much stronger single than \"Hold It Against Me\" or \"'till The World Ends,\" I really do wonder if labels are now holding back stronger singles ON PURPOSE. Traditionally, that would have been viewed as a mistake within the industry, but albums that ring-up multi-platinum numbers DO need that long-ish shelf-life, and in an age when ringtones (which can be as much as half of single sales) last barely a week for the average buyer within the market, creating the opportunity for that longer shelf-life may very well now REQUIRE the holding back of stronger tracks (for use as singles) deeper into the chart-life of the album. That would be a bizarre development within the industry -- and it would make monster albums much more rare.Again, we'll see.Back the the point here, Britney (musically) almost seems to steal the drum track entirely from New Order's Blue Monday, with the stuttering hook coming straight out of Ke$ha's COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO POP HOOKS FOR DUMMIES. A secondary hook is also in place here; Britney drags the E's out in the bridge-y Shame on me/To need release/Uncontrollably... and the whistling, too, could also be considered as a 3rd motif -- I'm probably alone is HATING the whistling; I'd have much preferred a keyboard... the whistling sounds far too demo-like for dance-pop, in my view. But hell, what do I know... she's gonna sell a boatload of this one -- I bet you she sells 3 Million ringtones from this ALONE, and probably by the end of the week, at that.3 stars.It's okay.The whistling is an ABOMINATION.A re-mix is badly needed.I have no doubt there will be many.\n", "val": 8.198285649996251e-05}

I listened to Unida Cantina maybe a half a dozen times prior to the show and was glad I did.  This is a CD that takes a few listens and then it grows on you and builds in interest.  Personally, I prefer RCPM's more raw and gritty work (Nada, Americano, Banditos) that has that in your face Southwestern quality.  Hence the 4 stars rather than 5.  That said, this is a quite respectable offering that draws from a variety of musical genres.  No outright duds and several that will join my list of favorite RCPM tunes, namely \"Marie,\"  \" Love is the Road,\"  \"Just Got High,\" and \" Today Belongs to the Light.\"  He played the first three I just mentioned in the show I saw and they were amazing.  If you're into Roger this is well worth buying.  And, hey, at Amazon, the price is right too.All over the Radio - catchyHeaven on a Paper Plate - I like the lyrics on this one.  Basically it reminds you that broke middle-aged people with kids can still have fun partying in their back yard.Dinero - also catchyGo with the flow - dittoLove is the road - I really like this one.  Roger performed it the other night and it was great.Marie - The standout on this disc IMO.  A fantastic poignant haunting love song with intensity and soul.  This one is destined to be a RCPM classicEmpty Highway - just OK, a little ponderous.Small World - a nice lyrical ballad with country overtonesUnida Cantina - a short Mexican-based guitar riff, niceJust Got High - this one keeps running around in my head.  More high on love than high on drugs.  \"So tell gravity to kiss my ass\"  is a great line.Today Belongs to the Light - this one also sticks.  It has an unusual (for Roger) reggae quality.Paper Airplanes - kind of sweet; kid friendly too!Play On - Perfectly pleasant but not a standout for me.\n", "val": 0.0099801542237401}
{"text": "well, we had a good run while it lasted.  LONG time RC fan, all the way back to the refreshment days.  have seen him live more than any other musician and have flown from NJ to see him at his circus mexicus party in mexico and i have probably bought over $1000 of swag from his web site.  but this may be the last RCPM album i buy.  i was extremely disappointed with the last effort, turbo ocho, but was willing to chalk it up for a failed self imposed experiment.  the album before, no more beautiful world was ok, but in hind sight, i feel it was the beginning of the slippery slope.  i was hoping this album would be at least as good as NMBW (or of course even better than it?), but i wasn't holding my breath.  glad i didn't.  gone are the days of clever/intelligent lyrics, balls out rockers, etc.  replacing them are more bubble gum songs.  there are some good ones (i'm not going to say which i think are good because that's personal preference and i've already seen on the 8 other reviews on here that if you ask 8 people the same question, you can get 8 different answers), but they are few and far between.  it's still not as bad as turbo ocho (THANK GOD), but not worth the buy for me.don't get me wrong - i'm still going to go see him live whenever i can, at least until his shows start to go down hill too.  but, considering the last time i saw him live a few months ago, that seems to be a long ways off - the band still puts on one of the best, most entertaining, friendliest shows i've ever seen.\n", "val": 0.00012698225327767432}
{"text": "I realize that all artists have to grow and change. Stagnation doesn't help anyone. If they change, fans complain that it's not as good as it used to be. If they don't change, fans complain that they do the same thing over and over. With Unida Cantina, the band is becoming more mellow, more adult, and turning their focus onto 'softer' things like friends and family. They haven't lost the societal commentary present in most of Roger Clyne's post-Honky Tonk Union songwriting, but gone are the gnashing teeth and firing pistolas. The hellraiser seems to have put away his sombrero, tucked away his snark, and turned more passively contemplative.The writing was on the wall as they steered the ship into somewhat experimental waters. The last few albums saw the edge dulled for more singer/songwriter leanings. The quirky ranch-rock rebel faded into neo-shaman philosopher (which to the non-fan must have been cloying with pretense). With Unida Cantina, elements of those personas are all there, but mostly just the tamed ones. Roger is now the aging hippy in the sandals, preaching peace, poetry, and pot.The result? A toothless, over-produced batch of roots-pop.\n", "val": 3.5657521948451176e-05}
{"text": "As a long time Refreshments/RCPM fan, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Since Americano was so completely awesome, I keep waiting for them to duplicate that effort.  Turbo Ocho and No More Beautiful World were enjoyable, but somewhat disappointing as follow ups to Americano.  The more I listened though, I did come out with some favorites off those as well.I have realized they will more than likely not duplicate Americano, but Unida Cantina turned out to be worth the wait for their first studio album in 3 years.I was at the CD release party and did not know what to expect, but was happy with the results.  Marie is one of their best songs probably ever, and I keep listening to it over and over.  It took 2 listens to really decide what I liked or didn't.My conclusion is buy this album!  I really like tracks 1-8, with the rest being enjoyable to listen to, if not awe inspiring.  No matter what, go see a live show as they are always fun!!!\n", "val": 0.026007013395428658}

Got my CD yesterday - and by the 2nd listen realized how WRONG I was.  13 (!) songs of which there are 4 or 5 you can NOT get out of your head.  Roger's songs are intricate weavings of incredible lyrics and surprisingly complex music, that takes a few hears to really get the jist of.  In fact try it with head phones on - far more there than expected!  Songs to pay attention to: All Over the Radio, Love is the Road (so many double entendres in his lyrics), Marie (great opening lyrics - if Bob Dylan was considered the great poet of his generation - then what do we call RC? .... yes I'm comparing Roger's skill to his!), Just Got High and possibly my favorite - Play On - which just a simple but beautiful repetitiveness really speaks to his love for doing what he loves ... playing music for his fans.

{"text": "Living in Arizona, Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers might be the best export we have right now! I went to the release concert for Unida Cantina, and it was awesome, as all of his live shows are amazing.I did not know the songs when they performed them as it was a pre-release concert, so I was a little underwhelmed hearing them live without \"knowing them\" beforehand. So my expectations were actually a little low for Unida Cantina.But I can safely say after a couple listens, I am liking it a lot. It's definitely what I would consider \"good music\". It's just a good ol' fashioned American rock band. I will say that they have seemed to lose a little bit of the Southwestern-flavor - just a bit though. There's not as many trumpets blaring on this one. It's definitely more rock-based, maybe more of a throwback to the Refreshments days.The lyrics on some of the songs were a little lame/ cheap/ unoriginal though. You have to admit that \"Go With the flow\" is kind of a dumb song title. But then again, it all ends up being catchy and like-able and pretty soon you're singing along on your ride home from work.\"Marie\" is possibly the best song they've ever done. It's beautifully done, with some great guitar work, like some sort of RCPM's Hotel Arizona (California).I'm definitely going with 4-stars, but maybe over time might increase it. This album definitely didn't disappoint me.\n", "val": 0.027836496010422707}
{"text": "I've always liked Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers.  Some of their earlier work perfectly captures the essence of the American Southwest, seamlessly mixing the ranch, the suburbs, and Mexican heritage into a veritable musical bouillabaisse.  Lately, though, they have been slipping.  No More Beautiful World is forgettable, but still has a nice feel.  Turbo Ocho was a welcome surprise, with only one of those boring, watered down pop rock songs that they seem to open every album with nowadays.I silently hoped they would stage a recovery with this one.  I heard some of the material live on a couple of occasions over the past week, and some of it was promising.  When I finally had a chance to put the record on and give it a good serious listen, I found that the first song, \"All Over The Radio,\" was...wait for it...a boring, watered down pop rock song.  There are four or five more of these to be had.With that said, there are a few keepers.  \"Marie\" is one of the best tracks they've made in awhile.  \"Empty Highway\" is solid.  \"Small World\" is a nice song.Overall, this is their most forgettable album yet.

I thought that No More Beautiful World was a fantastic record, and Unida Cantina was a let down coming off such a good album.  It has a few decent, catchy songs (like Heaven on a Paper Plate), but it also has easily the worst song I've ever heard Roger Clyne record (titled \"Go With The Flow\").  I think his \"slow\" cousin, Randy Clyne, wrote that song and after he wrote it even he said \"well maybe it could be a B side song\".  I like a couple of the tracks for easy, background music during a party or car ride, but there's nothing on here that I wanted to tell friends to check out, or I thought \"I can't wait to see this song live\".I'll leave you with a great, unrelated, RCPM lyric from a top 5 RCPM song: \"you name the time, you name the place, you name the contraband\"\n", "val": 5.630881787510589e-05}

{"text": "Having been a hardcore Roger fan since the Refreshments days, I look forward to every record he makes with the band he is in, as well as each tour and show where they come to NYC...they never fail to deliver and have fun with the Peacemaker crowd.  I look forward to Roger's new batch of songs because he never fails here either...someone compared him to Dylan and Springsteen...I would wholeheartedly agree, although Roger would not...he's too humble.  These new tunes are goodies I think, and yes, the album \"Unida Cantina\" as a whole required at least a coupla listens to absorb, but certain tunes jump out at you immediately, like \"Heaven On A Paper Plate\", \"Love Is The Road\" and \"Marie\".It's funny, Roger has one foot in new territory...the new songs, new adventures, the refined reggae of \"Today Belongs To The Light\" (which is \"Leaky Little Boat\" to the nth power)...and one foot in familiar AZ/Mexican spicy southwestern, alt-country-tinged catchy powerpop, and \"Unida Cantina\" would not sound out of place next to \"No More Beautiful World\" or \"Americano\" or Refreshements classics.  These new tunes could fit seamlessly into a set of the band's like a familiar pair of jeans and sneakers or a BBQ in Roger's backyard.  It's a good thing there's enough fresh goods here, otherwise things might be a tad TOO comfortable...it's a nice balance, and Roger is just displaying his strengths prominently on UC...he could be the Dylan or Springsteen of his generation, and the band is clearly having fun here.  \"Heaven\" could be a huge hit single if promoted, and now that Thirty Tigers/RED are on the ball with this one, as they are Flogging Molly, they could have a big record with this...one that stands out as a possible single-worthy tune is \"Paper Airplanes\" which is sweet enough to charm newcomers.Overall, UC is a real winner, it's a slow burner and will not fade fast...instead will burn itself into the craniums of the faithful as well as some newcomers to the AZ BBQ that is RCPM...many tunes that will become hardcore classics and concert staples as well.  Oh yeah, the band is firing on all cylinders here too...new guitarist Jim Dalton is great, up there with Brian Blush and Steve Larson, PH is one of the best drummers without fail, and Nick Scropos holds the bottom end solid...Clif Norell is their George Martin and he shines on horns, with Los Lobos' Steve Berlin nicely guesting on sax...makes sense...RCPM would fit perfectly with Los Lobos in the quirky southwestern, alt-country rock & roll sweepstakes.Keep it coming RCPM...you guys never disappoint...on with the tour, yeehah!!\n", "val": 0.016149349510669708}

{"text": "Hello & thanks for reading.  Here we have what I like to refer to as the future of jazz because Ambrose & the guys on this album are all young men in their prime.  These are the next batch of players like the masters that came before that are taking the music to fresh areas of expression & into the future.  Anyhow here you have the second album by 29yr old trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire a native of Oakland CA that now resides in the fertile jazz scene of NYC.  Ambrose has been playing & performing on the international jazz scene for more than a decade first coming to my attention in 2000 as a member of Steve Coleman's Five Elements appearing on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Resistance-Is-Futile/dp/B001ECM1R8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Resistance Is Futile</a>.  In my opinion Ambrose stands out in a scene with a great number of heavy hitting trumpeters not just because he has chops to spare  but because the man is a composer of the first rate.If I had to make a comparison I'd say he & Terrence Blanchard are in the same musical sphere but that would make sense because Ambrose studied with Blanchard while attending The Monk Institute.  All things aside I believe Ambrose is only at the start of his journey.  I always like to acknowledge the supporting cast of an album.  Ambrose has assembled an awesome quintet to realize his compositions.  Walter Smith iii on tenor is one of my personal favorites working today, he's developed a unique sound on his horn and featured Ambrose on his latest album for Criss Cross&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/III/dp/B003UOM5MY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">III</a>&nbsp;as well as his two previous albums<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Live-in-Paris/dp/B002QBWSC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Live in Paris</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Casually-Introducing/dp/B000ENWIAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Casually Introducing</a>.  Justin Brown is on drums reprising his role from Ambrose's 1st album<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Prelude-to-Cora/dp/B0016J7XO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Prelude (to Cora)</a>. In my opinion Brown's drumming is excellent for this music because you need a 21st century drummer to play music that's fresh like the music here, also Brown & Ambrose have grown up together allowing a chemistry seldom found in alot of todays jazz recordings.  Justin's drumming touches on many styles & cultures, I hear serious Afro-Cuban blended with the church & hip hop.  He's able to coax a tremendous amount of varied sounds from his snare & toms that has that very tribal African feel to it a la Eric Harland. Check out \"My Name is Oscar\" a drum composition that isn't like a typical drum solo hence the use of the words \"drum composition\" it features Justin's playing with interesting audio clips of monologue layered within which shows a serious talent, this man is smoking!  On acoustic bass Harish Raghavan a new name to me, I first heard him laying it down behind pianist Taylor Eigsti on his cd&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Let-It-Come-to-You/dp/B00160ANOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Let It Come to You</a>&nbsp;Harish commands a dark fat clear tone that supports the low end duties of the harmony with ease while stepping forward now & again to let know he's there at just the right moments.  Gerald Clayton is playing piano and boy does he play!  You may never guess that your hearing a 26 yr old, he has plenty of chops at the keyboard but he usually never allows them to dominate his playing instead a poised elegance with groove that can swing I always think he sounds a bit  like Wynton Kelly with shades of Bill Evans & Oscar Peterson. Check out Clayton's newest trio offering<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bond-The-Paris-Sessions/dp/B004GHPCX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bond: The Paris Sessions</a>&nbsp;.The reason I believe this music has the sparks that it does is because all the band members are a tight group of musical partners & they're friends after the music stops.There's no generational gap between the players they're all young men living their dream & I must say the music they produce together is very beautiful.  Here are a few of the albums musical high moments for me personally.  The lead off track Confessions to My Unborn Daughter is a beautiful ensemble piece that is very dynamic & contains some unpredictable twists as well as light & dark harmony, the piece reminds me at times of Brian Blade's FellowShip Group.  Henya bass intro features some nice melodic solo playing from Harish Raghavan which segues seamlessly into Henya which is a beautiful melodic ballad that has Jason Moran stepping in to join Clayon's acoustic piano on Fender Rhodes. The harmony reminds me of the way Mingus or Monk used dissonance to represent beauty like Good Bye Porkpie Hat & Ruby My Dear, the melody is very simple & quite catchy. This music seems to be more introspective & lyrical in comparison to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Prelude-to-Cora/dp/B0016J7XO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Prelude (to Cora)</a>but there are lots of nice burning moments of intensity especially from the soloists. I feel the tension created within the music is always well balanced along side the more romantic chamber aspect of this music.  Ambrose delivers a masterful trumpet performance on the hauntingly beautiful Regret(No More) he really makes the trumpet sing in ways I'v personally never experienced until now.  With that final remark I'll close by saying I think this album When The Heart Emerges Glistening is a fantastic piece of beautiful music that must be heard & experienced to fully appreciate.  Check this one out!\n", "val": 0.0001247164764208719}

{"text": "FINALLY some good, no holds barred, honest country music sung the way Conway, Porter and all of Craig Campbell's legendary predecessors worked so hard for. You won't find any bubblegum, hick hop, crossover auto-tuned music here. This is 100% twang, 100% geetar, and 100% country happiness condensed into 11 tracks. Can you sense my excitement over this one? As a fan of the classic country sound, the sound that makes country a genre that stands apart from every other genre, I am thrilled to death over Craig Campbell. He reminds me of the days when country meant something, back when artists like Travis Tritt, Clint Black, and Doug Stone were playing with the windows down while traveling down a dirt road on a 90's summer day.Craig's first release, \"Family Man\", was actually released a good six months prior to the entire cd and in most cases, that would be a risky move considering how new singles are coming out left and right these days, leaving a chance for \"Family Man\" to be overshadowed and possibly overlooked altogether. Fortunately for country music fans, the force was with Craig and the single actually gained momentum before the cd came out. \"Family Man\" has put Craig on the map and he's a featured artist on the Willie Nelson Country Throwdown Tour crossing the US this summer. The song pays homage to the proud blue collar worker who works long hours for little pay, who doesn't have much but has everything in his family. What a great song. The second song, \"When I Get It\" is awesome, it's basically telling bill collectors and anyone else trying to grab the little money we all work so hard for to stand in line and wait. LOVE IT! How many times have you wanted to or have you actually told those people they'll get it when you have it? His latest release, \"Fish\", is taking off like gangbusters after only being out a few weeks. (By the way, we all know it's not really about fishing, Craig. *wink*). The whole cd is filled with country charm and down home warmth and is three chords country with nothing but truth. Thank you Craig for bringing country back and for doing it right.Final word - SCORE! This is a \"must add\" for your collection, it's definitely a permanent addition to mine. GO GET IT Y'ALL! NOW![...]\n", "val": 0.013557407073676586}

{"text": "Opening with a chunky, long-awaited \"Sister Havana\"-like riff on \"Mason/Dixon,\" Urge Overkill effortlessly rewind the world back to 1993. The slightly out-of-tune guitars, a certain swagger, good singers, the updated Rolling Stones sound for Generation Xers like me, the complete lack of pretension and a sound that doesn't sound digitized and remains raw to the bone -- I haven't heard music like this since I was 20 years old, which is probably why it took me several spins to fully appreciate and dig \"Rock&Roll Submarine.\"Is it a perfect return to form for UO? I would say almost, but not quite. The band members produced the album themselves, and the result is that some of the tunes could have used a bit more finesse, perhaps more definition to give them added bite. Some albums are overproduced (especially these days); \"Rock&Roll Submarine\" lacks a topnotch producer's touch. Nevertheless, it's hard not to enjoy the invigorating hand claps and chorus heard on \"Rock&Roll Submarine\" (the song), the intensity of \"Little Vice,\" the quirkiness of \"Thought Balloon,\" the introspection of \"Quite Person\" and rugged but catchy guitar work on every song that never gets old. Interestingly, the lyrics and vocals on the final track, \"Touched to a Cut,\" remind me of an Axl Rose-penned tune, which might not please these indie heroes. (Note: it's a great little song that packs a lot of genuine emotion into 2 minutes, 9 seconds.)Who knows what the future holds for Urge Overkill, but maybe some experimentation is in order. After all, singers, guitarists and founders Nash Kato and Eddie Roeser have added a fresh drummer and bass guitarist to the mix. The band is already showing its younger rock `n' roll brethren how it's done on album and on the road; now it's time to up the expectations for themselves.\n", "val": 0.00017218259745277464}

Some here have mentioned muddy production.  I wouldn't say muddy exactly, but I wish it was a bit clearer.  Also mentioned by others is the vocals being held back in the mix.  I agree, especially Nash's.  And as for the writing, it may not be their best, but it is still solid...better than most in the rock genre today.

In terms of overall tone it's on the darker side, much more ETD than Saturation, but nowhere as good. Not crazy about the muddy mix either, but if the songs were there I could live with it.

I can't say that it's as good as Saturation or ETD, but it's a fine album that has the traditional UO crunchy guitar chords and brings me back to my past, when (I sound like an old fart here) rock music was much better than it is today.If you like hard-driving UO songs, you'll probably love \"Mason/Dixon\", \"Effigy\", \"Little Vice\", and \"Niteliner\".

Seeing them in matching suits with the UO logo added to the great music from their early work. They were ultra hipsters - Supersonic Storybook even had a cover by Dan Clowes. But after the Pulp Fiction & Sister Havana/Saturation explosion, their was nothing ironic about the big time aspirations. The music was still good - often very good - but had lost some edge. The underated Exit the Dragon did a lot to remedy the style to substance ratio, but still had too much professional sheen to let out the beast that is UO live. Even as recently as 2008 (thanks Bill!) they could cook a stage like few bands can. Rock N Roll Submarine manages to capture both their brutal live edge AND the accomplished pop songcraft of their later work. It's not a perfect album, but for UO fans this is the album we've always wanted, the best of both of their worlds.

I've owned it since it came out.If you enjoy jazz, vocals, good music, outstanding piano, bass, sax and a little trombone thrown in to boot, then just put this on and sit back.  You are in for a real treat.And if you happen to be a bass fan, you might just be blown away by Brian Bromberg's work on this CD -- starting with his OUTSTANDING rendering on the very first track.And as for underrated vocal artists, how about Sue Raney, who teams with Kenny for a superb duet on I've Got A Crush On You?Cole Porter, Ray Noble, George and Ira G., Jule Styne, Sammy Cahn, Billy Rose, Gus Kahn, Harry Warren, Mack Gordon, Oscar Levant, Alan Brandt, Bob Haymes -- they are all here and all are, I'm quite sure, quite pleased with Kenny's treatment of their work.

Beautifully poignant and beautifully done....5 BIG stars for one of the best male vocalists of all time at the very top of his game.And that's MY opinion.Okay?Double exclamation point !!\n", "val": 0.05007150396704674}
{"text": "Kenny Rankin sings the jazz of rainy Sundays by an open fire.His intimate and highly personal style is no better exemplified than on this set, \"Professional Dreamer\".In many ways it's a departure from his usual repertoire as it consists entirely of classics from the 1940s and 50s.These offerings reflect the musical values of another era - elegant and genteel songs from a time when melody lines were strong and lyrics dripped with intelligent emotion.These compositions lend themselves perfectly to Rankinesque interpretationThe standout cut \"But Not for Me\" ripples with a soft Latin undercurrent.Rankin's vocal improvisations are gentle and deliberate as they paint a soul-sad portrait of someone love has overlooked.Gershwin's beautiful \"Our Love is Here to Stay\" is another highlight of this very classy set.So too is the cheeky and whimsical \"I've Got a Crush on You\" and the ultra-evocative \"The Very Thought of You\".It's all exquisite grist for a very tender mill.An album for the ages - FIVE STARS for Kenny and the jazz of rainy Sundays.\n", "val": 0.02736745961010456}
{"text": "Like several other reviewers, I became a Kenny Rankin fan with Silver Morning in 1976.  At that time I was more of a fan of singer/songwriters like James Taylor and Joni Mitchell.  But then my tastes stared to expand into jazz with singers like Michael Franks, then Bobby McFerrin, and now Diana Krall.  I developed a taste for the jazz \"standards\" from the tin pan alley days.  So I put Kenny aside.With the release of this album (dedictated to his mother) he took a crack at the standards.  And what a crack it is.  I'd give my left arm to be able to sing like Kenny.  Since I can't I'm happy to plop play his CD and kick back.  His is a warm voice that envelopes you.  It's warm, with an incredible range, and incredibly melodic.

Not blues, which plays with hardship, not the dark side of life, but depressed.  But the last cut, Tenderhearted child, redeemed the album for me and was so good it made the rest of it worth it.  BUT, why would anybody put out a CD whose case is 1/2\" taller than any CD made?  No big deal that it is also 1/4\" narrower.  The extra 1/2\" means it won't fit in any drawer of my CD cabinet, so I'm throwing away the holder and putting it in a vanilla CD blank case.

{"text": "Greg Brown is my #1 favorite.  I remember like it was yesterday, driving back to work at lunchtime, and listening to Dream On from One Night for the first time.  The way my husband feels about Bob Dylan, that's the way I feel about Greg Brown. I can recite his lyrics from memory. I have driven 200 miles to see him perform in a little storefront performance space.  When I am anxious or depressed, I have a Greg Brown playlist on my iPod that will last for hours.No wonder that when this CD arrived (the first with new material in 5 years), it was a holiday at our house.  The first time I listened (on a pretty good sound system) was a bit of a letdown.  GB's voice seemed subpar, and this is not a guy who was ever known for his voice.  He seemed to be straining to hit the lowest notes.Cut to the next morning.  I popped the CD into my car player, and it was like hearing it for the first time.  The songs are deceptively simple, the arrangements are minimal, and it is pure and glorious Greg Brown.  Start with the title track Freak Flag. GB has several live albums where he breaks out the politics (a particular favorite is Oily Boys from Yellow Dog).  I expected Freak Flag to be a sly, raucous anthem.  Instead it is a heartfelt tune with a simple message:  I'm not ashamed to be a patriot, I love this country.  However, I could see him at a future live show doing a whole different take on the song with the same lyrics and turning it into a sly, raucous anthem.  That's how great he is.  (Also, I Don't Know Anybody in This Town proves that GB has plenty of slyness left in him.)The second track Where Are You Going When You're Gone features an absolutely delightful GB falsetto.The songs by his wife Iris DeMent and daughter Pieta Brown are quite touching.What I love the most about GB is that he is completely unpretentious.  He lives in his grandfather's house in rural Iowa with his wife and the daughter they adopted from Russia 6 years ago.  Whenever I have seen him perform he wears a hat of some kind - a fishing hat or a winter hat with earflaps, or something that looks like he dug it out of a trunk in the attic - and one time he returned for his encore having removed the blue work shirt he was wearing, he had on a white sleeveless undershirt but still had on the hat with the earflaps.  In contrast Bo Ramsey is usually impeccably turned out, with a shiny shirt, shiny boots and a big ole cowboy hat, and unmistakable shimmering Bo Ramsey electric guitar sounds.The point of this meandering review is that I love this CD.  It might turn out to be my favorite Greg Brown CD.  The story is that he was recording in a studio in Minnesota using Pro Tools with no backup.  When the album was nearly complete, the studio was struck by lightning and the music was erased.  Based on the liner notes, it looks like Freak Flag and Lovinest One were salvaged.  So what did he do?  Wrote some new songs, added a song by his wife and by his daughter, and went to Memphis to record a completely different CD.  The song Flat Stuff also appeared on a previous CD, but this time Greg is accompanied by Mark Knopfler on electric guitar.  So all in all, a fantastic example of a phoenix rising from the ashes, so to speak, and a wonderful intro to Greg Brown for anyone who is unfamiliar.If Tenderhearted Child is new material, and even if it's not, it's the perfect way to finish up the album.  It is an incredibly poignant love song to a child, presumably his young daughter.  The message I get from that is that music can evaporate into the ether, the only thing to do is take heart and take joy in what remains - and make more music!\n", "val": 0.007169316988438368}
{"text": "This is a wonderful CD release by the talented underrated prolific folk singer-songwriter Greg Brown, titled 'Freak Flag'. In this CD (11 tracks), Greg Brown tackles social disjointness & issues concerning immortality and the afterlife with great compositions (wonderful inspirational lyrics, music plus his beautiful velvety-smooth baritone voice). Greg Brown, a native of Iowa has managed to turn a sad story (he lost 10 recorded tracks in a lightening strike incident by recording 10 'new' tracks in Memphis, Tennesse). His wide variety of influences show in this great CD (gospel, blues, rock, country & folk). The opening track \"Someday House\" : a great track with lovely melody, vocals & guitar. Other great tracks include \"Where Are You Going When You're Gone\" (a song about immortality & the afterlife), \"Flat Stuff\" (featuring former Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler on guitar), \"Mercy Mercy Mercy\" (a slow bluesy folk track) & \"Remember The Sun\" (up-tempo track, great guitar chords & vocals). The okay track is \"I Don't Know Anybody In This Town\" : a slow countryish folk track. Solid track/gems/stand-outs include \"Rain & Snow\" (beautiful guitar string pick-ups, wonderful melody & great vocals), \"Freak Flag\" (mid-tempo track with wonderful guitar chords, melody & vocals. A song about Greg Brown's lack of faith in the direction America is taking.), \"Lovinest One\" (wonderful ballad), \"Let The Mystery Be\" (a slow melodical beautiful track about life, where we come from & where are going?) & \"Tenderhearted Child\" (a slow ballad, wonderful guitar string pick-ups, melody & vocals).

{"text": "I first became acquainted with Greg Brown when he was playing the cafes and bars in Iowa City in the late seventies. I thought then that he was a significant talent, and his \"Iowa Waltz\" project was a unique and refreshing achivement, especially in that disco and punk rock era, and spoke of small town Iowa life in a way that deserved to be heard beyond Iowa.Eventually, it was - and great, great albums followed over the next decade or so: In the Dark With You, It Gets Lonely in a Small Town, Dream Cafe, Poet Game, most prominently. In addition to the distinctive voice, there was a genuine folk quality and gift for songwriting, and it all got him a regular gig on Prairie Home Companion and national exposure.Then, with fame, extended travel (and living outside Iowa) he started in a different direction, beginning with Slant Six Mind. These albums went for a less melodic, more earthy, bluesy, rhythm-oriented sound, emphasizing this curious gritty, trailer-park worldview, featuring more derivative, duller songwriting and a voice so deep and muddy it was at times unintelligible.After several albums in this style, it is great to see him somewhat back - returning to more universal, less pretentious themes, concentrating on good songwriting and singing, and not letting Bo Ramsey overwhelm the process. I had started to think he had exhausted his talent, but maybe this is a revival. If you liked the 1980-1996 albums, this is worth getting.\n", "val": 0.012856758199632168}

{"text": "This one of Brown's best cd's this side of the century and I just rate it below two of his masterpieces The Poet Game, and Dream Cafe, two of the greatest folk cd's of the 20th century. The ballads are touching and deal with love and every day life, the more rocking stuff are mostly driven by a rhytmn that reminds me of Rexroth's Daughter from Covenant a mix of country rock and western. There is a political antiwar song about Vietnam. The only thing that is a bit annoying is I Don't Know Anybody In This Town it's a bit of a joke that I would like to hear in a concert, but a bit annoying with repeated listening.Now to the vinyl which is the format I bought: It comes with a sticker that says that there is bonus material and a code not that easy to implement in the website, it took me a few minutes. The bonus material is an extra track from Over and Under, not something that a Brown's fan buying a vinyl version will not have. The vinyl sounds strange, like if the voice of brown is slower than what it is, it's even deeper than in the digital version. I went and even checked if my turntable was slower than normal and checked the time of one track versus the time mentioned and there was no difference. Other records play fine. I cant explain this since the instruments sound fine too. So I now have two versions of the same record. Quite strange. I would like to hear from others who have bought the vinyl. Anyway this cd or vinyl is highly recommended. Old Greg does not disappoint. And I miss my friend Alan Green who passed away last year, we used to listen to Greg Brown together, drink coffee and smoke small cigars.

{"text": "Tracy Nelson's latest CD, \"Victim of the Blues,\" is truly worthy of my high rating. Everything about the CD is terrific: the strength of her performance, the energy of her backup, and the quality of the sound. I haven't heard many of her previous recordings, but now I'll be listening to her earlier CDs while looking forward to her next CD release. Each tune is performed with terrific balance of singer and backup. I think the result would be even more exciting with a sax included on a few tracks. I also like the efficient packaging of this CD; an attractive multifold cover, which includes some useful notes about the recording itself, replaces the traditional plastic jewel box.\n", "val": 0.04435107856988907}
{"text": "Depending on how you count, Victim of the Blues is Tracy Nelson's 24th or 26th release since 1965.  I like to use the higher number which includes two compilation albums, but that does not count her dozens of guest appearances on the recordings of other artists, or, of course, the dozen or so \"bootlegs\" of live concerts and radio appearances that have been floating around forever.  With all those records, you'd think Tracy Nelson would be better known to the general public.  Many of her thousands of fans (me among them) consider her to be the greatest singer of the past 40 years, but somehow becoming a household word has always eluded her.  This has not been helped by the fact that she has refused to be pigeon-holed.  Her first album, recorded in 1965, was pure traditional blues, straight from the repertoires of Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey.  She subsequently became leader and lead vocalist of Mother Earth, an eclectic band of musicians who played rock and roll mixed with rhythm and blues, blues-tinged country western and even experimental love songs based on gospel rhythm and vocal styles.  They also recorded blues and even dabbled in jazz.  Not only did Tracy and the band sometimes switch from one style to another in mid-album, they frequently mixed songs from each of these genres with styles and instruments appropriate to another.  In other words, they and she were totally unique, and Ms. Nelson and her bands have since driven several promoters crazy, for lack of an effective way to market and classify her output.  In the midst of her more-than forty-five year career, Ms. Nelson has recorded several records of pure country, several of pure blues, a few classic rhythm & blues albums and even a bit of honky-tonk.  Today she is known as a consummate roots artist, which I think finally manages to cover it nicely.As a long-time fan, I expected nothing less than a glorious listening experience from Victim of the Blues, especially since advance reviews of the album were ecstatic, and I have read more than one review that confirmed that Tracy is still a force to be reckoned with.  Nevertheless, I was somehow not prepared for the level of satisfaction I have already derived from this release, and I just received it.  Being the totally-devoted artist that she is, and possessing a completely non-commercial sound, Tracy's eclecticism sometimes takes some getting used to, even to those of us who know and love her music well.  More than once I have opened one of her new releases and thought, \"Well, it's pretty good, but it's not up to her usual standards,\" only to eat my own words short weeks or even days later when the true depth of her artistry sank in, and I was forced to proclaim it my favorite release yet.  But Victim of the Blues took off for me from the very first listen of the very first track, and never let go.  I was also pleasantly surprised to hear Tracy using her upper and lower register more than she has in a while.The album opens with a Howling Wolf finger-snapper, You Be Mine, which is so true to Tracy's usual style that she makes it her own immediately, I mean like before the first chorus is over.  Lead a Horse to Water is a song that Tracy once did as a duet with Angela Strehli; I have it on one of those wonderful bootlegs that pop up every so often, recorded directly from a radio concert.  Tracy has refined her delivery of the delicious lyrics to absolute perfection, and the new album picks up even more speed because of it.  Like anyone who has ever been to one of her concerts knows, by the second song Tracy is really warming up.Track three is a very Marcia Ball type number, Shoot My Baby, a duet with (who else) Marcia Ball.  Like her good friend Tracy, Marcia has racked up an impressive number of fanatically devoted fans over the past thirty years without ever becoming a household word.  I pretty much have every record Marcia ever recorded, including her glorious debut album, Circuit Queen.  The ladies have a lot of fun with this one, and it sounds it.  Tracy says she learned it from Sammy Lay when she toured with the Chicago Blues Reunion a few years ago.Tracy then gets down to business, as we knew she would.  You see, nobody and I mean NOBODY has a way with a ballad quite like Tracy, and the combination of her incredibly powerful voice and her ability to subtly wring every possible emotion out of a lyric is well documented in virtually every one of her past releases.  Even so, I was not quite prepared for I Know It's a Sin, a Jimmy Reed number that knocks it right out of the ballpark.  Half R & B and half do-wop tearjerker, I listened in awe as Tracy proved (once again) that she still has it.  Like I ever doubted that she does.No Tracy Nelson BLUES album would be complete without a nod to those who started it all, and the title number, Victim of the Blues, is a very little-known Ma Rainey number that Tracy transforms from fuzzy obscurity into a piece so entertaining, that I immediately yearned for a whole album just like it.  Anyone who liked what she did with Bessie Smith's `Lectric Chair will nod in appreciation as she uncorks what is surely the \"rootsiest\" of roots tracks in an album soaked in tradition.  \"People say I'm crazy; I'm just a victim of the blues...\"  Indeed.It gets even better.  Howlin' For My Baby is a Howlin' Wolf number that demands heavy toe-tapping and head tilting.  I had a friend over who is not familiar with Tracy or blues in general.  His verdict? Get this: \"Hey - play that werewolf song again - it was great!\"  From the mouths of babes.  Angela Strehli joins in and just like the Marcia Ball duet, it's clear that the ladies are having a howling good time.  \"If you hear me howling, calling on my darlin', whoo-oo-ooh-oo- hoo-whooee!\" I found myself singing along by the second chorus, even though I'd never heard the song before.One More Mile is an Otis Spann number that Tracy says has hung in her head since the sixties.  When Tracy says she likes a song, I listen closely.  Words escape me for this one; I almost feel like too much of a description would be violating some personal, sacred secret.  Trust me though, the song is perfection.Back in the day, when Tracy's famous Mother Earth band was struggling to get their first record contract, they recorded three songs for the soundtrack of a movie titled, \"Revolution\".  Two have been successfully resurrected for Victim of the Blues.  The first, Stranger in My Home Town, was written by the great Percy Mayfield and sung by R. P. St. John Jr. on the Revolution album (yes children, in the early days of Mother Earth, Tracy did not perform all the vocals).  I've had the Revolution soundtrack for several years; it's so obscure, that many of Tracy's most devoted fans are not even aware of its existence, and I had to send to England to get an original vinyl copy, since I couldn't find one in the U. S.  As effective as the original was, I never really heard the lyrics until now.  What a lonesome, sad refrain it is indeed, instead of the winsome, wistful song I'd always heard before.  Beautiful, Tracy.Tracy has occasionally indulged herself in outrageous but well-spoken lyrics, but with The Love You Save (May Be Your Own) she has outdone even herself.  I had to stop the CD and play this one three times to make sure I was hearing what I thought I was hearing, and decided after the third listen that it may be the most powerful moment on the whole record.  Then again, I hadn't heard everything yet.Feel So Bad was the first and only number I didn't warm to immediately, which probably means that in two or three weeks' time it will emerge as my favorite song.  We'll let you know.Finally, the finale, and WHAT a finale!  Also on the Revolution soundtrack, Tracy recorded Without Love (There is Nothing) her first tribute to her great mentor, Irma Thomas.  Here it becomes an anthem, a duet with John Cowan so powerful that I almost burst into tears.  As I've said before about Tracy's signature song, Down So Low, how many singers can you name who can record the same song - in this case after forty-four years - and sound better than ever doing it?  Well, Tracy does.  I have never felt such simple lyrics turn into such large goose-bumps, going from zero to seventy-five in less than 30 seconds.Tracy Nelson has done it again!  May she continue to amaze and satisfy us for many years to come.Meanwhile, I think I'll go play that \"werewolf\" song again.Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.006916677579283714}
{"text": "Tracy Nelson has been belting out tunes forever it would seem. One would think that at some point the artist would just completely run out of juices of the creative kind, and just stop.Not Tracy Nelson though. Her latest album, her 26th, literally rose out of the ashes. Literally!While her 100 + year old farmhouse was tragically burning to the ground, one of the firefighters courageously battling the blaze, told her they could save one room and it was their choice. Her and her long time partner, Mike Dysinger both replied, \"The studio!\"This album, \"Victim of the Blues\", which was named, paradoxically enough, before the fire, sends her back to her Chicago roots, belting out tune out after tune without ever letting up.In to lend a hand her on this amazing compilation of eleven tracks are Angela Strehli on \"Howlin' For My Baby\", Marcia Ball on \"Shoot My Baby\", and John Cowan on \"Without Love\".  Her back up band on the entire record is Mike Henderson on guitar and banjolin, Byron House on bass, John Gardner on drums, and Jimmy Pugh the piano and Hammond B3 organ.The music is essentially of the Chicago blues style she grew up with, but with touches of other styles, evidenced by the appearances of Marcia Ball and Angela Strehli both bringing their own unique style to the table, adding a bit of the Texas blues flair to at least some of the record.Don't be mislead though, this record is all Tracy Nelson and it is exquisitely produced top to bottom. The musician's performances are about as perfect as you will ever hear from a recording.The record gets started with Willie Dixon's \"You'll Be Mine\", followed by Earl Bridgeman and Philip Wootton's \"Lead a Horse to Water\", Jimmy Reed's \"Shoot My Baby\". You get the picture. This is a blues record through and through.I've truthfully listened to this album 20 or 30 times. It never grows tiresome. In fact, it seems that every time I put it on, it seems fresh, as if I'm hearing it for the very first time.That, my good friends, is the true sign of a classic.Tracy Nelson's \"Victim of the Blues\" releases today on Delta Groove Music.\n", "val": 0.012178433127701283}
{"text": "The one question that seems to haunt singer Tracy Nelson--and really throughout her career--is simply, \"Why isn't she better known.\"  Actual stardom is a fickle thing, of course, and I'm not sure I'd wish it on anyone (anyone with actual talent, I mean), but couldn't a mega-talent like Tracy Nelson have at least as much recognition as, say, Bonnie Raitt or Maria Muldaur (similarly eclectic artists with whom Tracy has collaborated in the past)?I used to ponder such questions a lot.  Now I'm just grateful that Tracy has had a long and varied career, is highly esteemed by her peers and beloved by her cadre of devoted fans.  Except for a decade long dry spell in the '80s (at least in terms of being able to land a record deal), she has remained prolific, if relatively unheralded, since the mid-'60s. Longevity counts for a good deal in the music biz: flash and trash can sell for a few years, but if you don't have the goods, don't expect a 40+ year career.Speaking of the '60s, that was indeed an era when you really COULD make a career out of being truly eclectic.  Nobody minded that the Beatles dabbled in every conceivable musical genre, so why they should have had any kind of issue with a (then) up and coming talent like Tracy Nelson and her band Mother Earth, who trafficked mainly in good ol' all-American musical styles like rock, blues, C&W and a tinge of jazz, makes no sense.  Except that it was probably a headache for marketers, who really like to keep it simple, so after that historically brief period of experimentation, record companies regained control.  In the late '60s, Columbia Records (a company Tracy would later record for) came up with the absurd-on-its face motto, \"The Man Can't Bust Our Music\"--'ceptin' of course that they WERE the Man and they pretty much did.Flash forward 40 years to Tracy's newest project, the genre-specific VICTIM OF THE BLUES and one thing becomes quite clear.  If Tracy Nelson had not posessed such a wide-ranging musical sensibility and if she HAD opted to stick to one musical genre and if that genre happened to be THE BLUES, no one would have had much cause to complain.  On her bluesier sides, Nelson has always exhibited a remarkable sense of assuredness and authority.  Hers is a voice just built for the blues, and while she'll sometimes in conversation, point to a musical colleague, such as her good friend and collaborator Angela Strehli, as being the \"embodiment of the blues,\" when you hear how Tracy herself just inhabits the classic blues numbers included on this album, you suspect that she's being almost too modest.  In short, among contemporary blues artists, Tracy Nelson is second to none.One thing that's evident on this album (yeah, I still call 'em albums), is that Tracy is a varied within the blues idiom as she is when she's genre-hopping.  There is no redundancy on this record.  And no overkill!  It's widely acknowledged among those in the know (and the cognoscenti, as well) that Tracy Nelson possesses one of the most powerful voices in the industry.  But she has also always used her vocal powers sparingly.  Tracy pulls out the stops on occasion here--most notably on the album's closer \"Without Love,\" a duet with John Cowan.But on other classic numbers such as the opening track Howlin' Wolf's \"You'll Be Mine,\" she demonstrates genuine restraint, punching things up here and taking little vocal jabs there, but only hinting at her full power at this point, keeping the full force of her vocals for later.  The record is perfectly sequenced, to the point that you'll lose something of its flow should you opt to play it on random select.Contrary to popular (mis)perception, the blues is a genre that's full of wit, wordplay and wry humor.  Tracy has managed to uncover a number of tunes with that emblematic humor, including the CD's second and third tracks (see, sequencing is important) \"Lead A Horse to Water\" and \"Shoot My Baby,\" the latter a fun and funny duet with the wonderfully sly Marcia Ball.  These numbers set you up for the album's first torchy tour de force \"It's A Sin.\"Early influences are always given their due on any blues oriented project Tracy involves herself in.  When she conjures up Ma Rainey on the title track, Tracy sounds authentic: no mere imitator, she has absorbed her influences and their tradition completely.  You can say the same about Howlin' Wolf (whose \"Howlin' For My Baby,\" she also covers to good effect), to say nothing of Muddy Waters (\"One More Mile\"), Percy Mayfield (\"Stranger In My Hometown\") and Joe Tex.  But what matters most is that, unlike so many of her 60s contemporaries, Tracy Nelson is no blues \"wannabe.\"  She's the real deal, and she's earned the critical and fan acclaim she continues to receive after 40 years in the business.  Now the only question is: will the broader public finally catch on?\n", "val": 0.0002801858354359865}

{"text": "Infectious Joy of Living by VeronneauBy Jean-Claude EliasJoie de Vivre (Joy of Living) is an album of sparkling sound of fine jazz-pop, amazingly interpreted by a vocalist with a lot of flair and savoir-faire. She is accompanied by a small group of seasoned instrumentalists doing just about the right thing to enhance the beauty of the songs, discreetly, elegantly. It's a selection of ten superb covers aimed to please and to make you feel happy, relaxed, and that perfectly succeeds doing so.French Canadian Lynn Vronneau creates the virtually perfect blend of easy jazz and sophisticated pop, with a zest of Latin music. All numbers are sung in English, except for Cielito Lindo that is done in Spanish and the opening track La Mer, sung in French. The French song starts with Vronneau whistling the theme from Blue Moon for a few introductory bars, only to shift into singing La Mer, Charles Trenet's megahit from the late 1940s, a song that has been covered more than 400 times in several languages but mainly in English and in French. The artist proves that the chords and the rhythm of Blue Moon and La Mer, two songs that apparently have nothing to do with each other, go very well together.For No One, a Lennon-McCartney Beatles song is transformed into a gentle ballad with a sweet bossa-nova beat. More bossa-nova is served on the next track, Corcovado, this one an original bossa, and a classic by Brazilian master Jobim.On the Street Where you Live, a tune from the My Fair Lady musical brings another transformation. It is changed from its original orchestral arrangement into a gypsy jazz swinging piece with the typical acoustic guitar strumming that usually is associated with the genre, a bit a la Django Reinhardt.Vronneau also takes on songs like One Note Samba, another classic by Jobim, Blue Skies, The Gentle Rain, Cielito Lindo and Brazil. The adaptation with new arrangements of all the songs is very well, very smartly done. It brings something new without destroying the original beauty of the pieces. And it serves Vronneau style rather well, allowing her to do excellent renditions.If the music is superb it is definitely the voice of Vronneau that makes a difference. She sings with what I call smooth power, and with natural ease. Well balanced between the lows and the highs, singing with restraint and obviously with some serious experience gained over the years, the vocalist brings a welcome change from the dullness of most current jazz-pop productions. Thank God Vronneau does not need to shout like so many vocalists do it today to let us know that she can sing!The language accent also is pleasant with this little charming English-French twist that many Canadian singers are graced with; again, it remains fairly subtle. Vronneau has a clear phrasing in the delivery of the lyrics, one that puts her on a par with the best jazz performers and that is very convincing; very moving by moments. The lady genuinely feels the words she is saying, she means them, which of course is an essential trait in the art of singing. Her vibrato is light and classy, never overdone.Tribute must be paid to the accompanying musicians. From the drums of Pete Walby and the guitar of David Rosenblatt to the backing vocals and the guitar of Ken Avis (Vronneau's husband), not forgetting the precious contribution of violinist Dave Kline and saxophonist Jeff Antoniuk, the band plays excellent music.There is no mention of bass guitar on the CD's notes. Indeed, listening closely to the album does not reveal any apparent bass sound, except perhaps for some soft bass lines that might have been played by Avis or Rosenblatt on acoustic six-string. Surprisingly the lack of loud bass does not affect the sound in any negative way, and besides, this is no pumping-bass dancing pop material!The album was recorded in the US in Virginia where the artist now lives. Vronneau started singing very young, ever since her childhood days in Sherbrooke in the suburbs of Montreal. Her influences include musicians for various genres and cultures: Ella Fitzgerald, Annie Lennox, the Beatles, Joe Dassin and Beau Dommage to name only a few.There are no new songs on the album, they all are covers, and the entire set is unpretentious. It is very well done, particularly pleasant to listen to, and I'd play it anytime instead of a mediocre production of original songs.\n", "val": 0.0421908013522625}

This CD blends together very well the fun or \"Muppetized\" tunes such as the Twelve Days of Christmas, Christmas is Coming, and Little Saint Nick with the downright beautiful songs such as The Peace Carol, When The River Meets The Sea, and Noel: Christmas Eve, 1913. Those songs are fantastic.  My kids (ages 4 and 7) adore this CD and adults enjoy it too.  John Denver's voice on this compilation is beautiful. There isn't a single \"bad\" track or a song you want to skip over. I love that while this CD has moments of playfulness between John Denver and The Muppets or The Muppets themselves (during some of the songs), the fun moments aren't dated or overdone or silly like Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer or All I Want For Christmas (not on this CD, but used as examples), but just playful, joyful songs. I can't recommend this CD enough.  The sample tracks don't quite convey the beauty and nostalgia of this CD.  This is truly a gem.\n", "val": 0.013291670940816402}
{"text": "It's the perfect collection of Muppet-ized Christmas classics and John Denver originals!  I wore the cassette tape out as a child, and now my inner child can play it over and over again as an adult.I must say that Miss Piggy is at her finest in this collection of songs.  Her interjections and renditions are hysterical!  \"When the River Meets the Sea\" is also a wonderful addition.  It's my favorite song in Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, and it's great to have a John Denver version of the song.Great album to listen to while decorating your tree!\n", "val": 0.06281523406505585}

{"text": "\"The fall\" can be easily considered a \"late at night\" mood album kind of thing IN the Plastic beach. It is fair to say that when it comes to music \"The fall\" is nowhere near the massive production \"Plastic beach\" (2010) had. I mean, cosidering that Albarn's approach the idea of the release of this album by using just an IPAD is more than enough to explain my statement. But in spite of that (for who might think that just by using an IPAD the music could be boring) Albarn and company come up with an interesting set of songs that are worth to listen to. There are lots of tracks here that sound just like demos or samplers put on all together but that doesn't mean that they're bad tracks at all (Phoner to Arizona, Hillbilly man, Detroit, Little pink plastic bags, The Joplin spider just to mention some). On the other hand, there are tracks here that were produced with closer attention (... and maybe worth it to be in PB): \"Revolving doors\" shows Albarn singing with love, \"Amarillo\" (my favorite so far) has this catchy tune from the melody that got me right away and \"California and the slipping sun\" is by far one of the weirdest things Gorillaz has ever released (mmm... it seems that Albarn had a conversation with Thom Yorke (Radiohead) before writing this song), a well done tune that takes you to different places back and forward.I must say that if this album had been released before Plastic beach I would've given it maybe 3 stars or even 2 just becuase it sounds so relax and uninspired by moments but since this record arrives a year later after the magnificent work Damon Albarn did with ALL the guests on PB I understand that \"The fall\" has a reason to be. For you to appreciate this album with its right fairness you should do the following: take \"Plastic beach\" and play it on a summer day (speacially if you're at a beach of course) during daytime all day long from beginning to end and then when sunset comes play \"The fall\" from beginning to end as well. You'll be able to notice what this album is all about.\n", "val": 0.0016132809687405825}
{"text": "Damon Albarn talked about retiring&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gorillaz/dp/B00005LMBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gorillaz</a>, but instead he made a new album, almost immediately after&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Plastic-Beach/dp/B0035G9ABQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Plastic Beach</a>. The Fall is low-key and concise, the shortest Gorillaz album. It only has one guest vocalist (Bobby Womack on \"Bobby In Phoenix\"), and even Albarn's presence is muted. His lyrics are often simple, fragmented chants (e.g. \"little pink plastic bags blowing on a highway\") that barely seem to rise above the music. Many songs sound like vignettes: only one is over four minutes long, and seven are under three.What this means is, The Fall is as close as Gorillaz have ever come to making a pure electronic album. For the first time, we get a chance to focus on all those weird sound clips, effects, textures and layers that were always bubbling beneath the surface of Gorillaz&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/albums/dp/B00082IJ08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">albums</a>. They come to the forefront and inspire a new emphasis on atmosphere. The instrumental opening track \"Phoner To Arizona\" starts with a fuzzy digital bass sound, fairly close to Plastic Beach, and adds some synth beeps from the same album, but also brings in dark, uneasy strings and a rhythmic hook that sounds like it was made by distorting the pitch on Albarn's voice and then chopping it up.You can hear Plastic Beach in the rhythm section, the beats have the same tinny, cheap drum-machine sound. Maybe Plastic Beach was actually recorded on an iPad, too! But, surprisingly, the music on The Fall actually has more detail. Even the idyllic acoustic guitar line in the beginning of \"Hillbilly Man\" is more technically and rhythmically interesting than any ballad from Plastic Beach. The best tracks are the instrumentals. The biggest stand-out is the strutting, cinematic, horn-driven \"The Snake In Dallas.\" But the breezy synth lead in \"Detroit\" is adorable and gentle, and the interplay between bright keyboard background and moody minor-key organ in \"Shytown\" (with some vocals, but it feels like another instrumental) creates a delicate mood, thoughtful but not gloomy.The pacing is excellent, and short as the songs are, they reveal a surprising amount of variety. \"Hillbilly Man\" switches gears completely from acoustic guitar to trip-hop beats, dirge-like synths and scraping noises, but the same downbeat tone persists through the entire song. \"California And The Slipping Of The Sun\" kicks into a pretty great techno groove, but only close to the song's end. The production (but not the composition) is fairly simplistic and one-dimensional, the instruments sound compressed and artificial, but they are often manipulated in interesting ways, for example the desolate synth-chirping in \"Little Pink Plastic Bags.\" Somehow the garish production style matches the somber mood and the album's overall concept. Apparently, it was recorded while on tour, and it has an atmosphere of transience and impermanence, sitting in some anonymous hotel room, looking out the window onto the usual highway, city or airport views and just killing time until something happens. \"Slipping Of The Sun\" even has what sounds like clips from a news broadcast or PA announcement.It'd be a miracle if there wasn't any filler. \"The Joplin Spider\" is blaring synth noise (that can be good, but not with this flat production), and \"The Speak It Mountains\" takes too long to get going, with nearly a full minute of voices repeating \"it is the dawn\" before any music shows up. But even those two songs aren't a total loss. \"Spider\" brings in more melodic keyboards in the second half for a more trance-like sound. It fades out almost immediately on arrival, but what can you do? And \"Mountains,\" once it gets over the voices, has a very relaxing two-note synth loop. It sounds like a nice intro to a song about the dawn, which unfortunately does not show up. \"Aspen Forest\" is a pleasant bit, not very memorable at first, but then a cascading harp-like phrase livens up the ending.A couple of songs are basically just typical Albarn ballads: \"Amarillo\" sounds like \"Herculean\" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Good-The-Bad-And-The-Queen/dp/B000IAZ3E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Good, The Bad And The Queen</a>,\" whereas \"Revolving Doors\" is a shuffling mope like \"Rhinestone Eyes.\" I don't suppose we can blame him for playing to his own strengths. Over the past ten years, he's become an amazing crooner.This may become a very under-rated album. There is no big single (in fact, no obvious single at all), the promotion is relatively modest, and yeah, the album was made in a month. One might be tempted to dismiss it as an insubstantial EP, collector bait like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/G-Sides/dp/B000060NUN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">G-Sides</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/D-Sides/dp/B000VQQIC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">D-Sides</a>. In fact, The Fall might even be better than Plastic Beach.\n", "val": 4.824604911846109e-05}
{"text": "This is a great CD release effort by the talented elecro/pop/rock music group Gorillaz, titled 'The Fall'. This CD (15 tracks) was composed & recorded by the band during 'spare time' in their recent tour of North America (what the band calls a 'musical diary'). The sound is elecro/pop/rock sound they are famous for plus much more (what the band member Damon Albarn calls strange sort sound of America). This CD opens with a great track \"Phoner To Arizona\" : great elecro-synthesizer/drumkit combination). Other great tracks include \"Revolving Doors\", \"Hillbilly Man\" (great slow sliding guitar/syncopation, great deep vocals & the track has a wonderful countryish guitar at the background/base track), \"Shy-town\" (great varied high pitched vocals), \"The Snake In Dallas\" (unusual/strange eletro-sound with background hissing sound), \"Amarillo\" (amazing pop/rock sound with deep voice vocals) & \"Aspen Forest\" (melodical elecro-pop track). Solid tracks/gems include \"Detroit\" (very melodical beautiful up-tempo track), \"Little Pink Plastic Bags\" ('playful' but very melodical track) & \"Bobby In Phoenix\" (wonderful guitar & great vocals featuring the legendary Bobby Womack on vocals). Okay tracks include \"The Joplin Spider\" (unsual/strange electro-synthesizer/drum sound), \"The Speak It Mountains\", \"California And The Slipping Of The Sun\" ('eerie/strange' vocals)& \"Seatle Yodel\". On the overall, this is great CD release effort by the talented band Gorillaz (taking into consideration that the material was composed & recorded during their 'spare time'/in between their 32 days tour of America & Canada, a highly recommended CD listening.\n", "val": 0.04373021796345711}

And of course Plastic Beach was covered in Murdoc, with all his collaborators and the pirate rummy feel.This album, The Fall, was mainly if not entirely 2D being projected through both thought, sound and lyrics of each song. A gentle tone, if you will. Having recorded these throughout his tours in America, each song contains an essence of each state and city he was in at the time, meaning no two songs sound alike.You have not fully experienced this album until you have put it on in a quiet room, found a comfortable place to lay down, shut your eyes and let the music take you away.Overall, even if this album is overlooked and often underrated, The Fall is a masterpiece within itself.

The hilight on here is Arizona and Revolving Doors, which is bound to get stuck in your head. The album, for some reason, had the feel of Damon's other band, Good Bad and Queen, probably because it's mainly 2D(Damon)singing the whole deal(except for one track).Is it Demon Days?Nope.Is it a good record to chill to?Yes, I think so.\n", "val": 0.0016155795892700553}

{"text": "For Gorillaz fourth album, Damon Albarn went New Wave by using mostly an iPad. This is an innovative idea that is not new, as in the late 70's and early 80's there were many other artists who did the same thing, just without the iPad. At first listen, \"The Fall\" seemed flat, with nothing interesting to offer. However, with repeated listening there are several good songs, but not enough to push this album past three and a half stars. The song titles do not match the lyrics for the most part, thus after repeated listens you might find yourself scratching your head as to which song was which.\"Revolving Doors\" and \"Bobby In Phoenix\" stand out while \"Little Pink Plastic Bags\", \"California & The Slipping Of The Sun\" and \"Seattle Yodel\" seem pointless. There a far more instrumental tracks on \"The Fall\" than any other Gorillaz album. This alters the feel of this Gorillaz album to where it's more like a chill-out album rather than the eclectic mix you've come to expect.So, \"The Fall\" is for fans only. It won't win new fans, and it might alienate some fans. \"The Fall\" is an interesting idea that ultimately feels unfinished--snapshots and sketches of ideas that never seem to fully materialize.Here is how \"The Fall\" compares with previous Gorillaz work:2001 Gorillaz: Three and a Half Stars2002 G-Sides: Three Stars2005 Demon Days: Four Stars2007 D-Sides: Three and a Half Stars2010 Plastic Beach: Four and a Half Stars2011 The Fall: Three and a Half Stars\n", "val": 8.808269194560125e-05}
{"text": "In In some ways Gorillaz is the most contradictory, anomalous phenomenon imaginable.  They are almost purely a commercial creation.  The way they came together, the way they are packaged and marketed--might as well be The Monkees rather than the Gorillaz.But they continue to experiment and create in really interesting ways, and they seem mostly willing to do it in public.  There's some unwelcome noodling and noise on \"The Fall,\" and that's hardly shocking given how the album was produced, but what is surprising is the warmth, beauty, and humanity they managed to pump into then squeeze back out of an iPad.Not every track is a gem.  In fact, as the CD started playing my first thought was, Oh oh.  Wasted money.  But very soon and for much of the rest of \"The Fall\" I revised my opinion.  And I'm left with this thought: Not every experiment on here is successful, but what IS successful is the ACT OF EXPERIMENTING.  I give them huge credit for having the courage--not to say ballz--even to put some of this stuff out there.  If this can inspire other people to turn their portable computing devices into sound studios with experiments of their own--so much the better.  Gorillaz has demonstrated very ably what is possible from that approach.\n", "val": 0.01841762475669384}
{"text": "From the desert heat of Arizona to the highest peaks of the Rockies to the urban center of Detroit, Damon Albarn is on a mission to convey the sense of traveling through America. Recorded on the Escape To Plastic Beach World Tour on an iPad and lacking the amount of collaborators of previous offerings, Gorillaz may be the better for it. The album has a cohesive feel that is different from the albums before. Note that this is not a main album and should not be treated as such.Some of the high points of this album are Amarillo featuring one of Damon Albarn's greatest vocal performances of all time, Bobby In Phoenix in which Bobby Womack delivers stunning gospel-reminiscent vocals, and Aspen Forest, an instrumental showcasing Damon Albarn's composing talents.So in conclusion, if you love Damon Albarn's vocals and composing talents, definitely pick up this album.

Even then, While there isn't anything quite as memorable on here as \"Feel Good Inc.,\" or \"Clint Eastwood,\" there's still \"Revolving Doors,\" \"Hillbilly Man\" and \"Amarillo,\" which should make those seeking the more radio-friendly type of tracks happy.  I admit that the synthesized bass and drums get on my nerves a little at a few points on the album, but it is far from the random noise described by other reviewers.

Beyond those songs, slower more jazzy songs like \"Nobody\" are just really good songs that also have well written lyrics but are more heartfelt jazzy songs.This range of song type is also what's holding the Album back from greatness. There's no continuity. The songs vary so much between being pop and jazz that you find yourself either being a little annoyed at the very poppy songs, or bored by the very jazzy songs (which is strange because independently they are good songs). It's not much of a criticism, but it holds the album back from being truly great.Despite this minor criticism, I would definitely recommend this album, especially for fans of Jamie Cullum (who Eliza tours with), Peter Cincotti, Norah Jones (if you handle a bit more of a pop-infused jazz) or anyone looking to get into the pop-jazz genre in general.\n", "val": 0.003894781693816185}

Starting with \"Fast to the End,\" they open the album blazing forward - and then suddenly shift gears down to \"No Answers,\" where Rickley's lyrical abilities shine through - \"I can hear the ocean when I say your name/ In the yellow hem of the sea's blue skirt.\"This is an album full of fast and slow; soft singing and screaming. But in the end, it's still the same Thursday you've always loved. Now they're just better - and after a few listens you'll be nodding your head to every word.Standout tracks: No Answers, Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart, Turnpike Divides\n", "val": 0.015397448092699051}
{"text": "I have no qualms whatsoever admitting that, prior to No Devolucion, I've been only a causal Thursday fan. I enjoyed aspects of Thursday's prior releases, but never fully embraced any album of theirs as a whole. Maybe that's because I'm not a huge fan of some of the 'Screamo' elements, that, to me (and this is only my opinion) littered some otherwise pretty genius ideas. I just felt those elements were often over used, and sometimes even unnecessary.  I continued to follow their work because I always thought they had such amazing potential.No Devolucion is the absolute fulfillment of all my expectations!This is a career-altering album. It is THAT incredible!I'm not going to give you a track-by-track break down. I simply don't have the time. However, the songs are simply breathtaking. They somehow manage to be earnest, emotive, epic, progressive, inventive, sinister, gritty and beautiful. I know that's a lot of adjectives, but you have to experience this album first to understand that all of them are at once completely relevant, yet somehow still inadequate.Music is my passion, and I'm constantly looking, hoping to find my next obsession. An album that consumes and enthralls me, an album I just can't take my ears off of. Unfortunately, they are few and sometimes far between. `No Devolucion' is one of these very albums. The Music Gods have again smiled upon us. Rejoice & enjoy! This one's a stunner!(This is by far my favorite release of the year thus far and I'm a Radiohead fan for crying out loud! You know how finicky WE can be).Disclaimer: Feel free to disagree with me if you want to. I'm not a hater, this is just my own opinion, and you are certainly entitled to yours. Music preference is a very personal choice. For example, I really can't stand Country music, but if Country music can make a person feel the way the music I love makes me feel, then I'm ecstatic for them.\n", "val": 0.010258887894451618}

So it has been a while, This new album is very different from Thursday but still seems familiar. They have for the most part lost their Post Hardcore sound in this album but there is still a few moments in a couple of songs that you hear the Post come out which is nice for old fans like me.

I'm more of a METAL type guy but keep my mind open to all forms of ROCK. After years I kept up with them and never really liked their work 100% but appreciated some songs like \"Come All You Weary\". After hearing some samples of this album on YOUTUBE a few days prior to release I had HIGH HOPES and anticipation. I went ahead and bought the album and it is pretty friggin' awesome. I feel this band has come a long way and have grown as a band and as people.

{"text": "KD Lang is back with a new band called Siss Bang Boom.  Her new album is entitled \"Sing It Loud\".  \"I Confess\" is my favorite track on this record. This tune has a vulnerable sounding quality in the first half minute or so, but this song picks up lyrically and musically into a song that sounds strong and bold by the end.  This is in due in large part to the guitar playing by Joshua Grange.  He is an excellent guitar player. He gives this song a punch that makes it special.  The title cut is \"Sing It Loud\". This song has a very relaxing tone.  The banjo playing is subtle and lovely on this track.  Joe Pisapia plays the banjo superbly here.  KD really chooses top notch musicians to join her band.  The best love song on this record is \"The Water's Edge\". KD's voice has a romantic quality to it. \"A Sleep With No Dreaming\" is another pretty song with romantic tone. I like this song a lot. \"Sorrow Nevermore\" is the happiest song on this album. This song is truly pleasant.  I love the banjo and percussion playing on this song. \"Inglewood\" is a tribute song to a place that KD Lang holds dear.  She makes California sound like a great place to live. \"Heaven\" is a very peaceful song.  KD sounds very soothing on this song.  Perfect Word is another song with great musical arrangements. The steel petal and guitar playing  is absolutely beautiful on this song.  \"Sugar Buzz\" is a song with a laid back quality.  This song is about a person's love can be addictive.  KD Lang makes me believe in love again. This new record is really enjoyable.\n", "val": 0.055021822452545166}
{"text": "As usual k.d. lang delivers a vocal whopper of an album. A perfect balance of velvety ballads and fun up beat songs. My favorite by far is \"Sugar Buzz\", a fun bluesy, playful and sexy song. This is k.d.'s first album with her own hand picked band since The Reclines, she kept Joshua Grange(Keyboards) and Daniel Clarke(baritone guitar, dobro), who spent several years touring with her... so you get that personal feel of a band that has played together for years. They also penned four songs together.The album has a feel of her contemporary style with a healthy nod to her country roots. You can hear the influences of her tutelage under Roy Orbison and lots of flavor of Bonnie Raitt. It is a great balance to the much quieter \"Watershed\". k.d. is back to exploring her edgier rock sound as well. k.d. also does not disappoint the fans as she has a few songs that she hits those incredible \"k.d. notes\". It truly showcases her tremendous \"Play to the back of the house\" vocal range and control. This is definitely an album to put in your \"road trip\" catalog and there is something for all tastes.

{"text": "(A deluxe version of the album with four additional tracks is available on lang's official Web site.)k.d. lang has earned the rare right to record exactly the material she wants, how she wants, and still expect an audience, and \"Sing It Loud\" reflects that with its self-assured, but often self-indulgent, songcraft - a formula that is ultimately winning due to her charisma and raw talent.Sharp-edged hooks don't run aplenty, so the songs do not generally demand individual attention, but they also sparkle with spotless polish, the result of an obviously meticulous attention to detail that makes the album play highly satisfyingly.That lang has recorded the album she wanted shows in the details. \"Sing It Loud\" is the kind of record a musician makes for his or herself, which means it will surely delight her most devoted but divide those who appreciate her on a more selective basis.The songs are co-written with Joe Pisapia, who left his seven-year tenure with Guster to join lang in the studio and on the road. Selections such as the off-kilter, idiosyncratic \"Sugar Buzz\" and the peace-loving anthem \"Perfect Word,\" which makes sweeping, grand use of the elastic fireball that is lang's voice, make the source of his motivation to work with her quite clear. Their talents gel well, and with lang's miraculous pipes as Pisapia's muse the results are purposeful and passionate.Whether the mood is thoughtful and considered (the ruminative \"Heaven,\" \"Sing It Loud,\" \"Habit of Mind\"), playfully romantic (\"Inglewood,\" the soulful opener \"I Confess\") or cheerfully optimistic (\"Sorrow Nevermore\"), the music is consistently comfortable and restrained - ideal for an outdoor concert in late summer.\"Sing It Loud\" is not the return to country that many fans of lang's salad days would like, but it is also the closest they may get to it, and given the great quality and labor she has gifted it with this not be considered a disappointment. It is a pleasing, rewarding listen from start to finish, navigated  by one of our most valuable voices.\n", "val": 0.04374508932232857}
{"text": "This reviewer fondly remembers k d when she tooled around the Strathcona hood of Vancouver, Canada in her 1963 powder blue Mercury with the slanted rear window that lowered.  Wide as a whale, this living room on wheels announced her presence in between world tours.  In her early days  during gigs at the Commodore Ballroom, she was fond of having a go go dancer on stage with her. Pure kitschy art!  Sadly, kathy dawn left the hood years ago for the far flung  metropolis of Los Angeles.  In the intervening years she  delved into pop standards,  and melodramatic orchestrated nods to fellow  Canadian songwriters.  Lang's expanded musical directions broadened her commercial appeal for sure, but after her Invincible Summer recording, her previously prolific song writing seemed  to run dry.  I confess wondering if k d would ever return to her roots and what made her so exciting and relevant in the first place.  In the  opening track of her new recording, \"Sing it Loud\" with  her new kick ass band,  Siss Boom Bang, in a collaboration with fellow band mates, she muses, \"now I know the letting go was my mistake.\"  While touring  to promote her last album, \"Watershed\" lang found herself gravitating toward country songs during sound check.  After a chance backstage meeting in Nashville with guitarist and songwriter Joe Pisapia, she knew she had met a kindred spirit to co-write the return to the musical territory that kick started her career.  In \"Habit of Mind,\" lang reflects, \"I've lost my edge, It's left the building like Elvis, I guess.\"  Judging by k d's spirited appearance on The Tonite Show when she performed \"Sugar Buzz\",  she appears to  be channelling Elvis  during his '68 comeback with  slicked up hair, black suit and red shirt,  more than making up  for the edginess and  sassy energy missing in her recorded output the past decade.  lang and  Siss Boom Bang have found a creative place to stretch out in this offering of nine new original compositions and  a stelIer cover of Talking Heads \"Heaven.\"  lang was determined to write a record perfect for folk festivals and laughingly told a reporter during a recent interview,  \"I Swear, on Buddha's lap I wrote this record for the Canadian folk festivals.\"  One of k d's gifts is continually tweaking her material live, and one can only  look forward to her stretching out  with this  new material while touring to promote  Sing It Loud.  Word has it that lang and her band have been reworking her older material as well,  giving her back catalogue a whole new life in the process.  Musing to a reporter, lang quipped, \"there's a lot more engine under the pedal there.\" It's a treat hearing our favorite torch and twanger  firmly back and sitting high  in the saddle again!\n", "val": 0.00014182967424858361}

{"text": "Although k.d. lang came out of the Canadian country tradition, she broke the mold with her hit album \"Ingnue\" in 1992, and she's gone her own way ever since. She has a voice like no one else. The moment she begins to sing, a spell of impossibly romantic longing is cast. \"Sing It Loud,\" a new album of original ballads, all but two of them written or co-written by lang herself, is the epitome of her emotive style, the quintessence of desperate, delirious passion. It's an instant classic.k.d.'s debt to the heartbreaking ballads of Roy Orbison is evident on the first track, \"I Confess,\" with its insistent drums, lonely steel guitar, and wall-of-sound backing, but she puts her own stamp on it and on each of the songs that follow. \"A Sleep with No Dreaming\" and \"The Water's Edge\" are quieter and even more tender and plaintive, but the mood shifts on the fourth cut, \"Perfect Word.\" Suffused with a Muscle Shoals soulfulness, it's one of my favorite numbers on the disc. The lyrics are simple and direct, and a steel guitar solo suits it perfectly. lang can bring an edge to her voice that calls to mind Dusty Springfield, a tough tone that carries over to \"Sugar Buzz,\" in which she and her band really let loose.Up next is the title track, with banjo accompaniment that reminds us of k.d.'s country roots. The country sound is even more pronounced on \"Inglewood,\" introduced by an acoustic guitar and joined by piano and a gently wailing guitar. \"Habit of Mind\" is an anthem with a soaring chorus, a second fave of mine in which banjo and guitar again play important parts. The CD concludes with a fine cover of Talking Heads' \"Heaven\" and another superb anthem, \"Sorrow Nevermore.\"Available only at the kdlang website is a 14-track disc with four additional songs: \"Reminiscing,\" a Little River Band cover; \"I Am the Winner,\" an uptempo country song; \"Hollywood Kids,\" a country ballad; and \"Hungry Bird,\" a dreamy tune that's classic k.d. You can also watch numerous videos produced over the course of her career. The most recent are \"Inglewood,\" a lovely duet recorded in Australia, and \"I Confess,\" the first single from the new album, performed both in concert and as a wild music video. The latter, set at a \"gentlemen's club\" in Hollywood called Cheetah's, features lang's terrific band, The Siss Boom Bang, as well as a fire eater, a colorfully tattooed pole dancer, and a pair of libidinous lovers who end up wrestling in the suds at a self-serve car wash.

You like the name. You like a mix of country/rock/blues. You order a drink at the bar. The band starts playing and you forget all about your drink. Most of the songs are ballads, in a slow to medium tempo. It is varied, and well-played. They even do a cover of an old Talking Heads tune. They live up to their name.They have a great singer. You just kind of sit there amazed. Her voice is rich and encompassing. She carries a lot of the melody, makes the songs come alive, and expresses the sentiment in such a way that you can feel it. She has great range, control and finesse; some of the notes make the hair on your arms stand up.I use the live, bar, simile because the music has a spontaneous quality and could be played well anywhere without missing a string section. It's completely accessible, and one might find themselves singing along (for me, even alone in the car, it can be intimidating to try and sing along with k.d. lang).Truth is, we know k.d.lang's voice; some assume the music will be good, no matter what it is, or whether we like the style, on that account alone. She makes whatever she sings sound great; that is one of her gifts.Some people might compare it to Torch and Twang as the last time k.d. sang with a small band sound. But this isn't Torch and Twang. Perhaps, if a geneticist were to splice A.T&T with Watershed and a few genes from classic rock, it might be similar. In my opinion, trying to compare it isn't really profitable.Let us hope she continues to sing it, in whatever form, for many years to come.\n", "val": 0.016781067475676537}

You're getting everything you'll love about her, that gorgeous voice, the extremely tasteful arrangements and musicianship, the immaculate production. Touches of country (love that dobro) and Lang's chanteuse's ease with a lyrical lick. But you'll also miss what you really loved. \"Sing It Loud\" is dominated by songs that range from mid-tempo (\"Sorrow Nevermore\") to downright languid (\"A Sleep With No Dreaming\"). The more you listen, the more it becomes obvious that Lang has given up on music that has any kind of pep in its step. When you call your band Siss Boom Bang, you'd expect a little bang, maybe? Not this time.Lang has still got the chops to take a song and just claim the thing as her own. While it mirrors the version done by Simply Red a couple decades ago, Lang's take on the Talking Heads' \"Heaven\" is masterful. She also nails the title track, but the point is that you're calling the album \"Sing It Loud.\" Is it too much to ask for a little volume, a little bit of kick? The same misrepresentation happens when you call a song \"Sugar Buzz.\" I'm not one to bemoan that she's no longer cutting \"Absolute Torch and Twang,\" but even \"Invincible Summer\" threw in a few pop thrills for a listener to grab hold of and for Lang to sink her teeth into. \"Sing It Loud\" is a joyless, tepid affair that you've heard too many times before.\n", "val": 9.149704419542104e-05}

{"text": "Sing it loud is simply another delectable morsel from the wonderful menu of k.d.lang. While many love to try to critique her, try to pidgeon hole her, try to place her in a genre, k.d.lang continues to push the envelope.Country star (move on people!), lesbian icon (I didn't think we needed a mascot!)crooning diva (got the talent, but not the ballroom gown!), I don't give two hoots. k.d. lang could sing from a insurance catalogue and make it sound desirable. The woman could charm a snake, male or female, and then leave you gasping for one more song. I saw her perform two nights ago and I left with the realisation that you don't get the chance often to hear such perfection.So honest ole' Fred and his scathing review. Get off your ole opry hobby horse and take in a concert of hers. But hey maybe you won't, because not one women would be looking at you.

It is a collaboration made in country-pop heaven, with the subtle twangyness of the band adding to but not overshadowing the productions.  The tunes are catchy and expertly arranged and kd is in ever so fine voice.  The new songs make for excellent vehicles for a live performance, with Sugar Buzz a live standout.

{"text": "it must be difficult for an artist who has created, in the past, an album that was such an iconic point in his or her career, to have to think about whether they can ever \"top\" that record.  Could Michael Jackson have another Thriller?  Could Sinatra have another \"Come Fly with Me\"?  Shadowland, at least in my opinion, is a jewel in kd langs crown.  I've been impressed with all of her albums since then.  But this record,  Sing it Loud, is more.  Much more.  Not only is her voice every so perfect, moreso than I have ever heard, the musicians and kd are tight!  Real tight.  And yet there is more.  Much more.  Her voice is beyond spectacular, the band is right on, and even the style of the tunes are so \"right\" for kd land. I still can't nail what makes this LP work for me.  It is the message of the lp.  I don't mean a political message - personal or otherwise.  She comes to us, her audience, thru the speakers and gives us what we want.  What we REALLY want from kd lang. That voice, that style, her wit and her beauty. She is an ACE! She knows it and so do we.  Sometimes ACE's can get bored or lax and rest on their laurels.  Not here.  This lp - every track - is perfectly arranged, and sang by kd.  If I had to go to an island for the rest of my life and could take ten CDs, this would be one of the first I put in the box.

{"text": "Earlier this month, I had the chance to watch an incredible k. d. lang and the Siss Boom Bang concert here in Fairbanks. Many of the songs in her set were taken from this album. The show ranks among the ten best concerts I've ever attended, and I've attended a ton of concerts over the years. lang's obvious enthusiasm for her band and her music, her superlative vocals and the energy she brings to a show doubtlessly color this review.But I think this is lang's best album in years. It's the most overtly rock album she has ever done, and the live show just emphasized it. Three of her band members sing harmony with her - no mean feat, I think you'll agree - and the electric guitar work blends perfectly with her soaring vocals. It's a tricky thing for a rock band to support and not overwhelm a vocalist; Siss Boom Bang has a near-magical ability to rock and leave lang's wonderful voice in front. \"Sugar Buzz\" illustrates my point. On a very strong album, with very few throw-ins, \"I Confess,\" the title track and \"Sorrow Nevermore\" stand out.This is a wonderful album. It gets a lot of play at my house, and never gets dull.What I admire most in an artist is the willingness to push boundaries, to explore new forms, to break out of what's comfortable. lang re-invents herself with every album. And this time, she's found something really special.Bonus tip: if you can see lang live with Siss Boom Bang, \"Hallelujah\" will completely blow you away. She's never done a bad version of Cohen's classic, but the band simply blows the other versions away.\n", "val": 0.04252255707979202}

I think this is k.d.'s best work to date, maybe because I like her working with a real band that I think pushes her to interact and be a part of a cohesive unit rather than simply a star with supporting players. There seems to be a great chemistry between them, and I think this is apparent both on the CD and live.

{"text": "I picked this CD up at my local Starbucks.  I'm a soul, R&B, Rap, Classical girl, but I admit that the music Starbucks promotes help me get out of my little plastic box.Being a fan of KDs stuff when she first came out, I thought she went into hiding till I saw this latest album (well she didn't, I just haven't been following her).Things I were expecting on this album, like KD's signature soaring voice so mellow and smooth like a nicely aged Bourbon, isn't exactly found on this CD.  However, this CD has a nice mish-mash of musical genres.  A little of her old folk/country, a hint of R&B, and even some 70's stuff hidden behind the rapture of slide guitar and banjo.There are tracks on here that I love, so haunting and so well conceived like \"A Sleep with No Dreaming\" or \"The Water's Edge\".  I also like some of her Tom Jones sounding, and appropriately titled, \"Sugar Buzz\".  Tracks I didn't like were \"Heaven\" it just seemed composed wrong or just the orchestration is off or something.  Something's just not right with it, its like a collaboration gone wrong.  It sounds like a slip-slod adventure (I don't know its that uniquely awkward sounding, so I had to make up my own word for it).Some tracks are very liberating like \"Sing It Loud\" and \"Sorrow Nevermore\"Overall I enjoy listening to this album, especially my favorite \"A Sleep with No Dreaming\" gosh the lyrics to this song is so unfair!

{"text": "I have long been a kd lang fan, from the very first song I heard her sing.  Didn't matter what she was singing - I could listen to her voice all day long.  I had planned to buy \"Sing It Loud,\" and had plans to attend her concert July 4th in Binghamton NY.  I didn't quite like the snippets I had heard of \"Sing It Loud,\" but so enjoy Ms Lang's singing that I thought I would give this new stuff a chance.  Consequently I was thrilled to be able to tune in to Jimmy Kimmel Late Night to hear her sing something from Sis Boom Bang Sing It Loud.  She performed \"Sugar Buzz,\" and something else that I didn't catch the name of.  Both pieces were AWFUL, I mean just absolutely awful!  NOt music,but noise, and rather horrid noise at that.  Like kd lang meets Alice Cooper for a cat fight.  Ms Lang wasn't singing  - she was talk-screaming, there was absolutely NO melody to be found, and there is absolutely no way to describe the band other than raw and amateurish and totally out of sync with each other and Ms Lang.  Consequently, I will NOT be buying \"Sing It Loud,\" and I have cancelled my travel plans to the July 4th performance.  I saw a video of an interview Ms Lang did with Dame Edna.  When asked what she wants for her future, Ms Lang said she'd still like to be singing into her 70's and 80's.  I fear that if Ms Lang continues on the track that she has started with this band and this album, she will ruin her voice, lose her fan base, and see a very early end to her career before she gets much into her 50's.  My advice is to listen to a little bit of these songs, and if you have the LEAST suspicion that you don't like it - don't buy it.  It doesn't get better.\n", "val": 3.1455172575078905e-05}

{"text": "I'm a musician. A rather good one. I joined the Musicians Union in 1960, and played jazz, R&B, contemp, country, etc, on TV, in movies, on soundtracks, live, and on tour. That means I have a lot of experience in listening, and playing LOTS of music. AND this isn't about me, but I just wanted to qualify the following review:I picked up on kd lang about the mid-eighties. I loved her then, and I love her now. She has such a strong natural dose of inherent musicial abilitiy that its sometimes just stunning. Have you noticed that her vibrato is usually REAL close to 16th beats relative to the tempo of the song she's singing? I mean, that is flat incredible. I can, and would like to sing her praises for the word-limit, but then, I would never get to the point.This album, and more the song selection and succession are just off a bubble from plumb. kd usually has real DEPTH to her lyrics, and the way she makes the listener FEEL exactly what she means by the words she sings is a huge strong point. Since blues, jazz and 'heavy genre' music first appeared, the high talents were those that made you, the listener, think that the artist was singing to YOU, in language that you understood, and that you knew the artist was singing just for you, and a select few that are on the same wave-length.I find the majority of these songs weak in their meaning. kd can usually do a la-la-la-la-la and have it touch my soul....not so on this project. This feels like it might have been a producer-mandated date-obligated release. I just don't feel the words like I usually do on a kd project. This release is good-don't misunderstand me...but it certainly isn't her best, or even in that range of releases that kd has brought to us. Compare this to 'Hymns of the 49th' and feel the different level of emotion.I'm gonna wait for her next project. I know it'll be better, and 'back in the saddle again'!\n", "val": 0.003529223147779703}

{"text": "\"I'll have a Snapple and a shot.\"  A thirsty Jerry Garcia during the sessions.If you're reading this chances are good that you're familiar with the original album with tracks taken from these sessions, so no in-depth review is really necessary.  If for some reason this music is new to you, if you like a relaxed, informal (very informal) recording of friends playing and singing some old-time favorites of theirs, this is something worth checking out.Over two evenings in '93 David Grisman (mandolin), Jerry Garcia (vocals/guitar), and Tony Rice (guitar) jammed in Grisman's studio with the end result being a set of tunes (and comments) that will give you an idea of how things were  back then.  The original album's songs are included in this set, placed in the correct context of the  previously unheard performances.  The sound is very good--clean and open with a bit of warmth--very nice.  There's no booklet included-and none is really needed.  The music speaks for itself.This  \"Extra Large Edition\" has been a long time coming and, along with the complete live Garcia/Saunders box set, has been eagerly awaited by many people (including me) who wanted to experience more of what went down over those two nights.  Again, if you're new to this and haven't heard Garcia play acoustically you're in for a real treat.  Along with Rice (who also can be heard occasionally  on backing vocals ) the guitar picking is wonderful--quick when needed, intelligent, and organically fluid sounding.  And with Grisman's mandolin adding  that  touch of old-timey country playing to the  sound, this is a nice, relaxed set of tunes.  Garcia's vocals seem to fit many of these songs almost as if they were written for him.The \"run throughs\" and different takes  of various songs are a nice addition and enhance the feel of this album.  Styles of music range from country/bluegrass, to jazz, folk, and traditional tunes.  Where else will you hear \"Man Of Constant Sorrow\", \"Amazing Grace\", \"Summertime\", \"So What\", and \"House Of The Rising Sun\", all on the same album, and all played with the same feel and ability?  Plus, hearing Garcia's warm voice--talking to his two friends and musicians--is just a nice thing to hear.  Maybe at my age I'm succumbing to the dreaded \"nostalgia\", thinking about seeing him walk into the old  Keppler's Bookstore in Menlo Park (late '60s/early '70s) , with his guitar case,  going into the backroom and hearing him  laughing and playing music with a couple of friends--and nobody thought much about it.  When the Haight was in full bloom and nothing was considered too weird.  Hmm.  Like the original album, this is even more of a time machine back to earlier and much different  times.Will this be on heavy rotation on your player?  I think most people will pull this out when they want to get away from more modern, computer based, \"perfect\"  music/recordings, and want to tap into something organic sounding, something that isn't anything more than what you hear on the tapes.  And I have to confess I find myself playing this \"Extra Large Edition\" more than I thought I would.  Besides another side of Garcia's music, there's a nice, relaxed, authentic feel to this music--you're listening to something that could've come out of the past, when musicians got together to sing and play and just enjoy the music and each others  company--and we're lucky enough to be there when it was happening.Don't think this is crammed mostly with complete songs only.  There's a lot of false starts, run-throughs, and conversation between the players.  But that's what makes this so \"human\", and  so personal.  Hearing Garcia, Grisman, and Rice make a mistake, or admit they don't know a particular verse of a song, or all the lyrics, or even how a song begins, is a look past the usual albums we hear all the time.  When you feel like you want to sit back with some friends, playing old favorites from a long ago past, this will do the trick nicely.\n", "val": 0.027578987181186676}

{"text": "My husband and I went on a road trip the 2nd week in June, 2011.  I hesitated leaving at the last moment because my 8 year old little cock-a-poo had been sick and was on antibiotics.  Normally I wouldn't be concerned as she was left in responsible hands......however......as we went to leave she looked me right in my eyes and wimpered very sadly, which was extremely unusual.As we were driving, this song came on the radio and I began to weep.  I told my husband that something must be really wrong with little Zoe and that I felt she was trying to tell me something.6 days later we returned to find a very happy little Zoe and I felt much better. I took her back to the Vet that same day we got home for bloodwork.  As a result of the bloodwork we scheduled an untrasound.  It was determined that she had cancer in her liver and pancreas and there was nothing we could do.  The very next day she took a turn for the worse and we decided to euthanize her.  My precious little Zoe who was so full of life!  I didn't want to see her suffer.I thought back to the way she looked at me that day we were leaving.  She didn't want me to leave  her.  And even though we didn't know of the cancer at that time, God was preparing me to let her go.  Her passing has been a \"blessing in disguise\" because the grief has lead me back to a place with the Lord where I am again praying and reading my Bible.  That was just 8 days ago, and I miss her so!  Thank-you for allowing me to share this.\n", "val": 4.081855513504706e-05}

Baroffio was Choir Master of the Choir of the Sistine Chapel for a while, so if the group is really associated with him that would seem pretty credible.I enjoy the fact that their \"Missa Angelis\" features prominent singing parts for women. So many of the big hit Gregorian chant albums of recent years (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Chant/dp/B000002SKX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chant</a>) have been performed by monks only, so it's sometimes easy to lose sight of the fact that Gregorian chants were also sung by nuns and indeed by mixed choirs.The \"Congregation of St. Lazarus Autun\" appears to be made up of members of the congregation of a church -- actually the Cathedral Saint-Lazare in Autun, France. They perform nearly two thirds of the total album, and the performances seem good and satisfying so far.It looks like only one of the tracks on this set has appeared in a previous \"99\" collection -- the \"Darkest\" set, so things look good in terms of repetition, which can be a problem with these sets. Total download size is 616 MB for 6.1 hours of music. Bitrates are variable and average between 203 and 242 kbps.Recommended at the bargain price!\n", "val": 0.0009511017124168575}
{"text": "99 Most Essential Gregorian Chants? HOW DID AMAZON KNOW?! Seriously, nothing says EPIC like Gregorian Chants! I'm totally blasting this out my car stereo while driving with the top down!On a serious note, these chants are some of the earliest forms of music and is quite interesting to listen to. It has a lot of history within Christianity and the Church. Many believe these chants go far back into history, but it wasn't truly formalized until Pope Gregory I. He is credited for starting these chants and is the reason why it's named after him. If your into historical forms of music or teach a music history class, I do suggest downloading this. This collection is great and I love how Amazon is expanding their 99 music collection with music that is generally not listened to by mainstream culture. As a person who appreciates and loves music and it's rich history, I'm very impressed they brought this collection out. It exposes people to these chants.\n", "val": 0.018828438594937325}

It's a nice little pop song, with an electric guitar adding some energy to the breathy, mellow male vocals.  Perhaps because it's so very unpretentious, however, I couldn't help liking it - a lot.  Or maybe there's just something about the quiet joy of this song that reminds me of that moment when you realize you're falling in love, and anything seems possible.  \"A thousand falling stars in sight/I'll catch them in my hat tonight/With you/I'll catch the stars with you.\"  It's nothing profound, to be sure, but it brings back fond memories and makes me smile.

Christian Scott's trumpet recalls much of the timbre and subtlety of Miles, but with his own unique \"whispering\" style of playing.  Quite a virtuoso and extraordinary talent in his own rite.

Recorded live in Paris, France in 2009, this is a killer set and the DVD makes it even a better listening & viewing experience. The keyboardist (Frederico Pena) keeps it real by not overpowering the other players, but when it's HIS time, he kicks out some of the tastiest Fender Rhodes piano I've ever heard.

And what a way to go, Dave hooking back up with old friend Butch Vig to produce it. The Twin brothers from different mothers.\n", "val": 0.045820679515600204}

But with all that she decides to give it a go with Motivation, the lead single from her 3rd solo record Here I Am. The song overall isn't really as driven as she could've made it to be.

This time out on THE COMPANY WE KEEP, they keep the proceedings strictly traditional.With Jason Carter (fiddle) and sons Ronnie (mandolin) and Rob (banjo) providing the sparks, Del makes good use of his plaintive tenor vocals on this 14-track collection. Del co-wrote three of the albums tracks, including the autobiographical \"Never Grow Up Boy\" where he asserts:  \"I make my Living with a guitar/My job is standing on a stage/I played in churches, fairs and dive bars/I ain't never gonna act my age.\" And at age sixty-seven, let's hope he never does.

{"text": "Playing Time - 51:37 -- It's difficult to maintain your place when you're already on top. Everyone's been wondering how the Del McCoury Band would follow the album \"It's Just the Night,\" that won IBMA's Album of the Year Award for 2004. The very first item you notice about The Del McCoury Band's \"The Company We Keep\" (the second on their own McCoury Music label, distributed exclusively by Sugar Hill Records) is the high quality production of the 12-page fold out CD jacket with liner notes, numerous color photos, and lyrics to all songs on this generous 52-minute project. First impressions and marketing ARE important! While the music always takes priority, it's great to see their record company not skimp on the rest of the product. Del and the Boys have never been content to merely rest on their laurels. Rather, they've always been strong proponents of giving their fans 125% whether it be in live concert or on compact disc. That's the attitude that Del conveys when he sings his original (co-written with Harley Allen) \"Never Grow Up Boy\" about being a \"guitar pickin', bluegrass singing, never grow up boy\" whose dreams \"can set men free.\" Del and Harley also wrote \"Keep Her While She's There.\" Del also collaborated with Don Schlitz on \"If Here is Where You Are.\" Ronnie McCoury's instrumental \"Seventh Heaven\" is top-notch.The Del McCoury Band is also a full-speed-ahead band packed with vocal and instrumental energy and excitement. One song in  time (When Fall's Coming Down) provides its nice contrasting rhythmic beat at track eleven. They keep their music upbeat and distinctive as they deliver the bluegrass goods written by such songcrafters as Mark Walton, Joseph New & Jeff Silbar, Larry Keel, Liz Meyer, Gary Nicholson, Jeff & Dean Presley, Jerry Salley & Susanne Mumpower-Johnson, Mark Simos & Jon Weisberger. We have to thank these writers for some very cool songs that bring out the best in this band! We have to thank the Del McCoury Band for being some of the hardest working musicians in the bluegrass business, and for being meticulous with all the details that come with the fame. Not just great entertainers, the band members are truly highly credible and professional emissaries for the genre. In eight years, McCoury's been IBMA's Entertainer of the Year. \"The Company We Keep\" pays tribute and expresses gratitude to all friends, family and team members who have helped make them what they are. The CD's back cover shows Del's grandkids at the head of the table and indicates that the McCoury bluegrass tradition is in very good hands.

{"text": "The same arguments plaque bluegrass over tradition , new grass or other hybrids.  For me there is room for it all. The Del Mccoury Band has always maintained a balance between the old and new in both arrangements and songs chosen. In the award arena, I have heard fellow bluegrass fans state \"They won another one, what about the other great bands.\"  The fact is the Del Mccoury Band continues to maintain a standard of excellence sustained by few.  This cd is no exception.  Its all there, great playing, arrangements devoid of musical cliches, and five star song. What else could anyone want?\n", "val": 0.008617554791271687}
{"text": "On this double album, nearly all genres of music are represented from classic rock to country and dance. This album is worth supporting for two reasons. The first, most of the profits will go to help the victims of the tsunami and earthquake in Japan and this is a great way of donating your money and receiving a token of appreciation in return. Secondly, there are some great gems including a reworked live version of Sting's classic \"Fragile\" , Lady Antebellum's balled \"I Run to You\" as well as Ne-Yo latest single \"One in a Million.\"The one criticism I have regarding the tracklisting is that there is a large proportion of older hits that many of us probably already have. Imagine if the record companies had included an exclusive remix to the Black Eyed Peas latest single \"Just Can't Get Enough\" (the video of which was filmed in Tokyo a week before the Earthquake)instead of \"One Tribe.\" Or included the elusive Japan-only cd remix to Rihanna's hit \"Only Girl in the World (Bimbo Jones mix)\" instead of the regular album version that is already featured on countless other compilations... This would have boosted sales for this very worthy cause. I do applaud the artists and record companies for putting aside their egos and coming together.\n", "val": 0.011924102902412415}

Some of the song choices themselves are encouraging/soothing/empathetic/engaging to the double tragedy (massive earthquate & devastating tsunami), e.g. \"Shelter From The Storm\" by Bob Dylan, \"Human Touch\" by Bruce Springsteen, \"By Your Side\" by Sade, \"Hold On\" by Michael Buble, \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" by Elton John, \"Teo Torriate(Let Us Cling Together)\" by Queen, \"Fragile\" by Sting, \"Save Me\" by Nicki Minaj, \"If I Could Be With You\" by Enya & \"Pray\" by Justin Bieber. 2 CDs (36 tracks in total, Disc 1 = 17 tracks & Disc 2 = 19 tracks) with overall great music to hopefully warm the hearts of the Japanese communities torn apart by a natural disaster of Biblical proportion. Some music fans may have most of the songs already, but not as this compilation and hey it's for a very good charity cause!

{"text": "First, I gave this 4 stars because the primary reason for buying this was to support the relief efforts in Japan. I already the original version of most of the music. I bought this mainly with the idea of listening to some music of artists that I either have not heard of, or hadn't felt that their music was worth investing in as of yet.Overall this is definitely a value album since you get 38 songs for less that $10. Most of the songs have an uplifting melody or lyrics. Most are rather slow, so if you are looking for dance music than this is definately not an album for you.I can't speak of all the songs, but I know that some are definitely not the original versions and because of this I was quite disappointed. I considered dropping this another star, but I reconsidered since the primary reason for buying this wasn't just for the music.(No particular order, just how they loaded into my music player)Good versions:Lady Antebellum - I Run to YouFoo Fighters - My HeroMicheael Buble - Hold OnAdele - Make You Feel My Love (Excellent song. Slow but has a jazzy feel)John Mayer - Waiting on the World to ChangeKings of Leon - Use SomebodyNorah Jones - SunriseJohn Lennon - Imagine (Excellent song even if I now own 4 versions of it)U2 - Walk OnBob Dylan - Shelter From the Storm (Interesting this song was selected for this cd, but good addition)David Guetta - When Love Takes Over (One of the surprises on the album for me because I did not know the artist)Eminem - Love the Way You Lie (I am not a huge fan of Eminem but this is a pretty good song. In my opinion he always sounds better when he gets a quality singer for the chorus)Keith Urban - Better Life (I am not a huge country fan but this song is pretty good, although it still has some country twang)Pink - SoberCee-Lo-Green - It's OKAverage versions:Bon Jovi - What Do You Got?Nicki Minaj - Save MeSade - By Your SideJustin Bieber - Pray (I am not really a Bieber fan but this is a decent song)Enya - If I Could Be Where You AreElton John - Don't Let the Sun Go Down on MeQueen - Teo TorriatteSting - FragileLeona Lewis - Better in TimeNe-Yo - One in a MillionShakira - Whenever, Wherever (Personally I liked her Spanish version much better)Beyonce Knowles - IrreplaceableBruno Mars - Talking to the Moon (While I do like his two popular singles, this song seems a bit too slow for him. Still a decent song)Katy Perry - FireworkRihanna - Only GirlJustin Timberlake - Like I Love YouMadonna - Miles AwayBruce Springsteen - Human Touch (Sounds a bit muffled but it still has pretty decent quality)Josh Groban - AwakeBlack Eyed Peas - One Tribe (This seems to be the exact same as on the E.N.D. cd)Poor versions:R.E.M. Man on the Moon (Thankfully I own the original which is way better. This version sounds muffled and the 'Hey Baby' lyrics sound so fake)Red Hot Chili Peppers - Around the World (Again a bit muffled as in the REM song. Not a horrible version, but not as good a quality as I would expect thankfully I already own this song as well).Lady Gaga - Born This Way (This super extended version is horrendous. I actually like the radio edit, since I don't actually own the single. This one was my biggest disappointment since I was hoping this version was at least comparable to the radio edit)\n", "val": 0.01506893616169691}

{"text": "3.11...we can never forget the day. On Tokyo where I live, earthquake over two minutes continued. But more dreadful incident was Tsunami, tidal wave. I couldn't believe that the disaster of tsunami was breaking out in my same country. Off course I did help as possible as I am as Japanese, for instance, money donating on internet Yahoo, or I searched charity so that I could help in Tokyo where I lived.Though such direct charity or donating act is important,too. Like this item, we don't only give money donating, but also enjoy music with contributing to our country. This approach will be good as we can give something, at same time, take something.I remember \"We are the world\" at the middle of 80's when I know this item. Though I was just a boy on those days,I was very moved that super stars like Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder took part in the event for helping African countries that was suffering from heavy poverty. By such situation, songs that we listen to on our daily life will have more charms. Imagine by Johon Lenon is a message song that he prayed for the world without war. Even if earthquake on this time is different to the main theme of the song, if we stand on more broad view point that we search true human peace  in addition to peace world without wars, this song may be deeper mean.On Haichi earthquake disaster, 80's musician was re-organized like once We are the world. this act was very amazing. Many Japanese famous persons like musicians, actors, writers is donating over 10,0000 dollars. On the other hand, people that have not such big money is trying to behave as possible as they are, for instance, a pro guitarist went to the stricken area to encourage people with a guitar. A mimicry actor went to that to please them,too. The process and mind may be important rather than visible figure like amount of money.There is a proverb in Japan.\"chirimo tsumoreba yamatonaru\". This means even if that is dusts, by is piled up,someday that will become big mountain.Even if that is 1 cent donation, donation that have not the significance never exists. There was one incident that I know the significance factually . I took part in donation charity event after the disaster, when one 10 yen coin(about 10cent coin) was put in my donation paper box, I was about to shedding tears(when I went back to home, I remembered the scene, and shed tears). That was the moment that I have known by experience that amount of money was no business. If you listen to one song on the cd, at the same time, that means that you donating about 30 cents. If there is one dollar coin,Charity organization can give hot meals to the stricken area people. This is just proverb act that I have written.It will be important that we behave with considering the stand of another people on all the things.Thank you for reading my poor English.\n", "val": 0.0006280941888689995}

Add in the fact that the artists and their labels have waived their standard fees, which means all profits go to help those who are suffering in Japan, and \"Songs for Japan\" may justifiably become one of the year's highest sellers.Of course, some inclusions are less generous than others, such as Adele's take on Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love,\" popularized by Billy Joel, as opposed to one of her several larger hits. Still, the standard of quality persists, with a leaning toward strength-of-conviction anthems such U2's \"Walk On\" and the pure, unadulterated beauty of John Lennon's \"Imagine.\"This makes tracks such as Pink's 2008 Top 20 hit \"Sober\" and Rihanna's recent chart-topper \"Only Girl (In the World)\" - not to mention Justin Timberlake's 2002 Michael Jackson mimicry \"Like I Love You\" - stand out like sore thumbs. Nevertheless, the amount of (mostly) solid music for the price is large.Madonna's \"Miles Away\" is represented by a solid live rendition on the digital release. It was one of the best tracks from her 2008 album \"Hard Candy\" and should have been a hit single. Other lesser-known gems include Bruce Springsteen's satisfying, underrated \"Human Touch\" from 1992.Kings of Leon deserve commendation for turning down a paycheck in the name of the artistic beliefs and not licensing their music to Fox's \"Glee\" yet including their biggest hit (\"Use Somebody\") here without any profit to be had.Some of the sequencing is a bit odd, as though the track list was determined by drawing names from a hat. After all, a recent Justin Bieber recording (\"Pray\") sounds a bit jarring when so close in proximity to soothing Enya (\"If I Could Be Where You Are\") and classic Elton John (\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me\"). So does Shakira's 2001 smash \"Whenever, Wherever\" next to Norah Jones' gorgeous \"Sunrise.\"\"Songs for Japan\" is an impressive selection of music, precision-tooled to draw a large audience together to spread music and, most importantly, charity.

{"text": "I have been a big fan of Ray Stevens for probably close to 50 years. I have tons of his recordings from NRC, Prep, Capitol (2 eras), Mercury, Monument,Barnaby, Warner Bros., MCA, RCA, Curb and probably a couple of other labels.On this day (July 30, 2011)when our country might go into default and not meet our obligations for the first time in our history I am particularly tired of Ray's current Tea Party orientated messages. I used to be able to seperate the messages from his music. His arrangements of songs are so great (his arrangements on some Beatle songs almost rivals theirs, there's a very funny song called 'Heart Transplant' - about an old man getting a young man's heart - and many genuine smash hits) but I have had enough. I believe in the President's health plan and I certainly hope to get  my Federal pension check deposited in my account this month and the months to come. I believe the rich should share in by contributing more so the cuts to less fortunate is less painful.

{"text": "***The review contains SPOILERS***This latest offering from Ray Stevens is wonderful in it's topicality, humor, sarcasm, and irony. Released on April 1st, this digital download features 11 songs that will put anyone in either a political mood or at the very least a current events mood...and you'll be laughing throughout most of the collection. The collection starts off with Ray's current single and music video, \"The Skies Just Ain't Friendly Anymore\". I wrote a review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Skies-Just-Ain-t-Friendly-Anymore/dp/B004MZFZDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Skies Just Ain't Friendly Anymore</a>&nbsp;back in February and if you click that link you'll be able to read the review. The video's been viewed by more than 134,000 people on You Tube.Track number two is a catchy sing-a-long...entitled \"Mr. President-Mr. President\" we hear Ray giving a rundown on all the things that are going wrong in the country (mostly of Obama's making) and it's then we hear Ray ask the President what are his plans going forward. The President gives his plans on straightening out the economy and the unemployment problem among other issues. It's a very funny song and it fits Obama like a glove.On the third song, \"God Save Arizona\", we hear a very serious performance condemning the United States Attorney General as well as the critics of Jan Brewer and Joe Arpaio. The single and subsequent music video was released in August 2010 and you can read my review of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/God-Save-Arizona-Single/dp/B0040JLILW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">God Save Arizona - Single</a>&nbsp;when you click that link. The video's been viewed by over 680,000 people on You Tube.In the collection's fourth song, \"Cap'n Trade the Pirate\", we're told the tale of a pirate who wants to join forces with the President and punish America, too. The pirate goes through his credentials of why he feels he's uniquely qualified to be the enforcer of both the environmental and energy policies of the far-left. He plans to shrink the 'carbon footprint' and has plans on job growth in addition to having plans to help programs near and dear to the progressives. Ray performs the bulk of the song in the pirate voice that many Ray Stevens fans are well aware of.Turning serious again we have the clever \"Uncle Sam\"...in this quiet, reflective ballad Ray sings about an Uncle named Sam who's gotten up in years and doesn't have a grasp on reality. The uncle throws his money away at the drop of a hat...but Ray (the nephew) comes up with a plan on trying to help his Uncle get on the right path and regain his common sense. This performance is followed by the high-energy, inspirational feel of \"November Storm\" which incorporates meteorology jargon when describing the previous election cycle and the one upcoming in 2012.Some may be asking themselves: Does Ray tackle illegal immigration in this collection? Why, yes, he does...and he does it well. In his previous collection,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/We-the-People/dp/B003INBNRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">We the People</a>, Ray sang about illegal immigration on a song called \"Come to the USA\" (it's music video has over 5,000,000 views on You Tube). Meanwhile, on this SPIRIT OF '76 collection we have a further tale of illegal immigration titled \"Mi Casa Su Casa\". As we near the end of the collection we get more and more into satire and irony. \"Grandpa Voted Democrat\" may appear from it's title to be a sentimental song about how a grandpa voted...or a song about a grandfather's political beliefs...but in reality the song is a wickedly funny story about a bizarre chain of events.Track 9 is what Ray mentioned would be his next single/music video: \"Obama Budget Plan\". The song is more or less a sequel to the collection's opening song, \"The Skies Just Ain't Friendly Anymore\", in that Ray delivers the song with a similar vocal delivery and the arrangement/instrumentation is similar, too. This time around the couple (who I refer to as the TSA couple) have apparently made their way from the airport and become fixated on living their lives on what's referred to as the \"Obama Budget Plan\" and so they create a vast operation in their basement as they live out their goal of emulating Obama and rack up debt as far as the eye can see.Track 10, \"News Machine\", takes shots at TV news in general and especially the times when it's a slow news day and the mundane is lifted into the stellar and reported on insatiably 24/7. Track 11, \"New Normal\", is another satirical song and this time around we hear of a once rich man down on his luck thanks in large part to the President and the pay czar. We're told of how lonesome it is living underneath the bridge and how he can't wait for 2012 to roll around when Obama's kicked out of office...officially putting an end to Obama's \"New Normal\". As an added touch Ray delves into Hank Williams territory and yodels the song's title while a harmonica plays in the background.There will be a CD version of this Mp3 collection coming soon.\n", "val": 0.0033980675507336855}

Continuing the aural display we are treated to an upbeat boogie number 'Runaway'. The title track keeps the feet moving and allows her to showcase her adroit skills at plucking leads in a tasty manner that enhances the overall mood of the song.This is her solo debut release containing nine originals and two covers. Produced by Mike Zito, who  co-wrote 'Push Comes To Shove' where he performs a nice duet with her in a song that is somewhat reminiscent of the Sue Foley/Peter Karp 'He Said, She Said' of a while ago. On this release we also get to hear Ms. Cassie Taylor on bass, who is one third of 'Girls With Guitars' (along with Samantha and Dani Wilde) who have been burning down festivals across the country this summer.My favorite cover is  'Louisiana Rain', the Tom Petty chestnut, which is presented with perfectly crafted vocals by Samantha, who then adds some thick, sweet slide guitar that refreshes this well known to a new level - and it's perfect played loud while driving in the car !I first met Samantha on the an LRBC cruise when she had to step in for an very ill Danielle Schnebelen of  Trampled Under Foot, she was outstanding and I believe that opportunity solidified in her mind what her potential really was. She certainly showed it to the crowd who loved every moment of her performance with the band.blues411.com has this and even more for your enjoyment, stop by soon.\n", "val": 0.03455457463860512}

I first heard about Samantha when she was playing a local blues show in my home town.  I got on youtube and checked out some of her stuff.  It was impressive, but I was not compelled to go see her live or pick up the album.  After she played the show I heard nothing but rave reviews from people I know who went to the show, so I decided to give the album a try.  I am glad I did, Fish is a very talented young lady.  She is a more than competent guitarist and her voice is outstanding.  The fact that she wrote the majority of the tracks on this album is also impressive, as she has proven to be a very strong writer as well.  To my ears there is not a weak track on this disc.  The album is quite wide in scope as well.  Samantha tackles traditional blues, but also forays into rock, country (a truly incredible cover of Tom Petty's \"Louisiana Rain\"), and ending with a torch song, \"Feeling Alright\" that oozes a sticky late night lounge feel.  The Ruf label is the home of today's hottest young blues talent and Samantha Fish has come right out of the gate as one of the best on the label.  There are several songs here that if given the exposure could be radio hits in my opinion and this is a girl who has a very bright future in front of her.  For me this is one of the top blues albums of 2011, and I am looking forward to seeing what this girl does next.\n", "val": 0.03858331963419914}

It is one of the MOST authentic, natural and absolutely AMAZING nature recordings of WATER (Babling brooks and Waterfalls) I had purchased!When they say relaxing they weren't kidding. Of all the nature sound music I have, I seem to enjoy this the best. This aren't a rushing streams, it's more of a small babbling brooks and some of faster too. Several years ago I found a private camping spot in Oregon next to a stream that sounded much like one from this CD. During the two nights I camped there I've never slept so well before or since.Sometimes on these nature tracks you can hear sounds repeating. I have one of those that repeats about eery 45 seconds. Once I hear the repeats I just can't use it to relax. If this album repeats like that I've not been able to find it. I like to think they had microphones set up next to a stream and recorded for the entire length of the track.

This was a surprisingly excellent find for me. Instead of shredding a guitar to sound bad, they make every note mean something. As a guitarist who can appreciate a meaningful lick, that means something. The lyrics on top are well thought out with well laid down. If you are a fan of the \"Freebird\" band, you can hear the influence but they keep it new and fresh. I was impressed. They remind me of the Drive-by Truckers without the overload on depression and darkness. An excellent surprise.\n", "val": 0.039661623537540436}

At 58 years of age I had the pleasure to see the original Lynard Skynard band live on multiple occasions and it was surreal.This group of guys from Texas is every bit as good and their lyrics are awesome.  Many folks like to ride the mainstream popular Southern band of the moment.  I can tell you seeing these guys live and listening to their CDs they kick butt and take no prisoners.  What a great time we live in to see the rebirth of not good but great southern Rock n Roll.Thanks Whiskey Myers for giving me hope that good ole rock n roll-Southern style is here to stay for quite some time.  If you haven't listened to a CD of theirs don't walk but run and purchase one.

The updated tempos and range are clearly one of a kind and very good. There's a few haunting sections that made me want to go back and repeat listening again, again and again. I knew I loved it within the first sounds of the song and loved it enough to want to hear it again before the song was really started. Doubtful, anyone in any genre could judge the soulful sounds in Gravity as anything other than an outstanding performance with a healthy edition of vocal passion. I'd see this as a good song for any collection and wish I could have heard more! The music is outstanding!

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag.

{"text": "Aching with the beauty and mystery of a Sarah McLachlan masterpiece, `Gravity' is the perfect showcase for the haunting vocal ability possessed by Barnaby Bright; both Rachel and Nathanial complementing each other flawlessly.  The way these two vocal wonders play off one another (perfect harmony and vocal dueling alike) is mystifying.  The track really has an otherworldly feel to it, evoking a time and place far from here.  Even the lyrical content is far from phoned in, despite the use of the overused word `gravity' (why do so many singers love to use that metaphor?).  The verses are beautifully full of rich meaning, and the elaboration of that word, gravity, is executed with such lyrical depth throughout the chorus.  I love the new wave of interesting folk singers, and these guys certainly rank up there with the likes of Damien Rice, Lisa Hannigan and Gypsy Tailwind.  The acoustic guitar plays out a simple yet intricate plucking of strings while the vocals shine and take the song to new heights.  Rachel is particularly effective here.  She has such a classic beauty to her voice; soft yet sharply delicate.I'm buying their album like yesterday!\n", "val": 0.04168051481246948}

{"text": "I have been a fan of Too Slim & the Taildraggers for a while now, but it is the progression of the last couple of albums that have made me more of a fanatic.  I have come to expect more out of the band and \"Too Slim\" with each album, and the last couple have not disappointed.  Shiver continues this upward progression and I'm not sure what they will be able to do for an encore but I can't wait to find out.  I have listened to this disk straight through about 5 times since I got it last week and it is still growing on me.  The title track is, in my opinion, the best on the album and one of the best in their entire catalog.I have one regret and that is that I have never been able to see this group live (I live on the other coast).  The live tracks that they have released clearly show that they are probably at their best live, in a smokey bar with the amps turned up to 11.  Shiver in particular has that feel to it, horns blasting, etc.  Maybe someday they will release a \"live\" studio recording, similar to what the Black Crowes have done.With that said, if you are a Too Slim fan you have to own this and if you aren't yet, Shiver should turn you into one.\n", "val": 0.018219569697976112}
{"text": "Too Slim and the TaildraggersShiverUnderworld  Records[...]By James \"Skyy Dobro\" Walker & Amy Walker12 songs; 54:00 minutes; Library QualityStyles: Patented Too Slim Music; Contemporary American Rock and Roll; \"Alt-Country-Dirty-Rock with a Blues-Vibe\"Earworms: they are the songs and phrases from songs that get repetitively stuck in my head. But, the songs I hear are ones already in existence. Way beyond me is Tim \"Too Slim\" Langford who has creative vision to hear songs that do not yet exist. Slim begins hearing music in its embryonic stage and eventually knows what a song should sound like before it is ever recorded. For example, Langford told me he could hear Curtis Salgado singing \"Everybody's Got Something\" before he ever invited Curtis to sing the lyrics.\"Shiver\" with its 12 original songs is Langford's most fully realized and most ambitious project yet. And, with 15 prior CDs, he has had lots of practice. Too Slim explained, \"As the songwriter, I end up hearing the songs in a complete way [before they are recorded].\" On previous CDs, \"I ended up making compromises\" due to hired producers and geographic distances preventing complete control. \"On this one I felt like I knew exactly what I wanted, and I got it!\" The album was produced, engineered, recorded, mixed and mastered in Langford's home of Seattle WA enabling Too Slim to be there everyday. Plus, co-producer Conrad Uno at Egg Studios \"had really good ears, and we hit it off like that! We were just always on the same page.\"Demonstrating Langford's growth, maturity, and musical mastery, \"Shiver\" contains many firsts for a Too Slim and the Taildraggers CD. Bassist Polly O'Keary sings along with Too Slim on several numbers while the third Taildragger, Tommy Cook, provided all drums and percussion. Mark \"Kaz\" Kazanoff's Texas Horns are very tastefully added to a few of the tracks while three background vocalists enhance two more cuts. A guest guitarist plays lead on the title track while Slim plays rhythm; it's Langford's adult son, Austin Elwood Langford. Guest vocalist Duffy Bishop also adds to the title track with traded vocal leads and a duet with Too Slim.Summary:Having personally observed Too Slim's career progress over the last 16 years and 13 albums, I feel qualified to pronounce \"Shiver\" a Tim Langford masterpiece. A full year's effort went into the creation of this work, and the masterful song crafting is readily evident. It does invite fans of pure Blues to alternately open their Roots Rock arms, but when the Rock and Roll is this good, you got to love it! You may even wake up with it in your head in the morning.Some Songs:\"Daddies Bones\"-- The painstaking, master craftsmanship that went into this number make it one of the best songs. \"... Bones\" is a harrowing and chilling tale of death, organized crime, and betrayal. The chorus is a family's earnest plea: \"If you find daddies bones, could you please send them home? Maybe we can save the farm if we can prove he's gone.\" The unique guitar notes are coming from Too Slim's gold, hollow-body Gibson ES 295. \"Daddies Bones\" shows why it truly deserves to be an album called \"Shiver.\"\"Can't Dress It Up\" -- Reality TV -- the reality is that many of its \"stars\" do anything but shine. \"Why are you trying so hard to be what you're not? Why don't you just try to live in your own skin? When reality takes over, after your makeover, you're gonna see that you can't dress it up.\" The Texas Horns here pump up the message with Too Slim's patented rocked-up guitar sounds. In terms of wit and satire, \"Can't Dress it Up\" makes the cut but will probably get \"voted off the island\" by the \"Jersey Shore\" sycophants.\"I Heard Voices\" and \"Everybody's Got Something\" - - \"I Heard Voices's\" 48 seconds serve as a smooth opening to \"...Something.\" Here Curtis Salgado's award winning voice is joined by background vocalists, and some of Too Slim's most melodic guitar joins Joe Doria's B-3 organ in a Gospel-inspired, joyful number of hope and affirmation.\"She Sees Ghosts\" -- There's nothing creepy about this delightful ditty, despite the  paranormal. Too Slim's German Shepherd, will see something and follow it around. \"You probably think it's a joke,\" Slim sings half-apologetically. \"...Ghosts\" excels in an album full of catchy hooks, and check out Cook's percussion solo, which gives off an auditory air of rattling bones. What does Shiloh really see? \"The dog knows, but she won't give it up. I sure wish that dog could talk!\" \"Shiver\" -- The growling Rock guitar intro sets one's teeth on edge.  However, when Too Slim's understated vocals weave their way  followed by Duffy Bishop's high pitched growl, that's when cold shivers crawl down the spine. We've all made unwise choices and tried to hide the proverbial \"bones in the closet\" that \"make me want to run!\" However, the  consequences often continue to plague our psyches long after we've faced up to them. \"Confessing won't help--it's with me forever. It haunts me still; I'm doomed to remember. It makes me shiver!\"\n", "val": 0.000999419717118144}

Almost every song is overplayed. Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating ! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.

{"text": "This is a fabulous recording!  I don't know how to qualify that statement other than to say I am a music junkie and have been for more than 35 years. I typically don't write reviews since my musical taste, like everyone's is personal to me.  After listening to this recording, I felt compelled to let fellow blues rocker fans know that the music Gods dropped a golden egg on the planet with this recording. I saw this band in a blues club in suburban Chicago about 7 years ago and was impressed with the band and especially the musicianship of its leader Tim (Too Slim) Langford. At the break, they talked with the crowd and were genuinely very appreciative of the opportunity to play live. Since then I have followed the band and try to listen to their new recordings when they come out. Based on that history, I purchased Shiver thinking that is would be as good as their previous recordings with some twists that help distinguish it from previous recording catalogue. I have to tell you, I was blown away with how good this recordings is.  I played it again as a reality check to make sure it wasn't a case of 'new music' shivers.  The 2nd spin confirmed my original take that this band put its all into this recording and was hell bent on making a serious musical statement.  If you are a blues rock fan, do yourself a favor and give this disc a listen and then do what you can to support this band going forward.  With the support of new fans, this band will hopefully remain on the music scene for a good long time as their best work is yet to come.\n", "val": 0.018044961616396904}
{"text": "Well, I'm Embarrassed to admit it but..Where have I been...? I bought Shiver by TST on album cover art alone and am I happily surprised! Seems they have been around for ages and I somehow missed them. Excellent mix of Rock & Blues Rock all dressed up and ready to go. Seems they draw from a great background of Rock & Blues from the past. Bands like Savoy Brown, Early Elton John(I know, but the rocker stuff), Marshall Tucker, Jimi(last name not necessary is it), Clapton, ZZT, SRV and a few more. That's not a knock on TST, it's a compliment. Vocals are great, no, I mean GREAT and Langford's guitar work is better than excellent. The B3 of Joe Doria could not be better, he is just a great one and never over plays, just seems to know exactly how to dress up and decorate a song. Not one week song on this CD as far as I am concerned. Shoot,the vocals and tune \"Shiver\" could have been on any album back in the Big Hair-Glam Rock days and done very well, that one caught me off guard. I absolutely love \"She Sees Ghost\" lyrics are excellent and good pick me up tune, gets you going and fun. \"Everybody's Got Something\"(vocals by Curtis Salgado are perfect and this might be the song of the CD but then there's \"She Sees Ghost\" and no that's no joke), \"Daddies Bones\" is a Great One(reminds me of a riff by New York's great Guitarist Chad Sonenberg of now defunct bands \"The Fool\" & \"Janet Speaks French\", if you never caught Chad live well he was absolutely amazing), \"Inside Of Me\"(Maybe this is the song of the CD, oh there's Joe again on the B3),\"Shiver\" and then ends with \"Bucerius\", what a fun and cool way to end the album, reminds me of the beginning of a Surf Movie starting with someone talking over it as it begins....plus part of the song track reminds me of a Fave \"Beatles\" song named \"Anna\". I have to say it, this CD is an immediate fave of mine and is getting lots of play time in the house and the car as well.

{"text": "This is an amazing album. Blu is a very slept-on artist, and one of the best true hip-hop has to offer. His first album, 2007's Blu & Exile (Exile made all the beats) Below The Heavens, is already considered a classic in many circles. His second LP, under the name Johnson&Jonson with Mainframe as the producer, Powders&Oils, received mixed reviews critically, but I also consider it a classic. This is his first solo EP, producing and rapping, and it is also his most mature album. He has perfected his lyrics and delivery.The project flows together between tracks with Blu rapping and instrumentals. It's a short EP, 14 tracks totaling just 30 minutes. Definitely listen straight through the first time.Top 3 Tracks:\"Amnesia\" is a wonderful joint and the best track on the album. Instantly unique and beautiful. This song has 'classic' written all over it. Blu samples Billie Holiday singing 'Am I blue?' over a serene beat. Lyrically, and such smoothness of delivery, it may be the best of his career.\"Since\" is another standout. Blu uses yet another classic sample, creating an old-school-feel-good-rock-n-roll vibe. Really, who else could flow over these instrumentals and sound so perfect?\"Untitled(LovedU)2\" is an unforgettably smooth journey. Again, entirely unique, there is nothing in hip-hop that sounds like this. And lyrically, Blu drops a beautiful verse with lovely wordplay.In Conclusion: Any track Blu raps over is notable and worth multiple listens. 'Vanity' is another such track.

Seriously, how many albums can pull that off?\n", "val": 0.016017930582165718}

{"text": "Ben Drew is Plan B and his sophomore CD \"The defamation of Strickland Banks\" comprises Motown/Northern Soul-inflected music, in sharp contrast to his Hip Hop/Rap debut.Making him stand out just that more from a scene already awash with the likes of Daniel Merriweather, Duffy, Amy Winehouse, Mark Ronson and the rest, is his interspersing of verses spoken/rapped in his pronounced British accent, much like fellow Brit The Streets.The album is a concept album, with each track telling different parts of the tail of some Strickland Banks character who gets locked up for a crime he didn't commit. Drew sings in a throaty falsetto, sort of a cross between Terence Trent D'Arby and Smokey Robinson.\"Love goes down\" is an incredibly beautiful ballad with sweeping strings, fleeting horns, and lovely harmonies and it's a deadringer for a Motown classic. Upping the tempo are the organ/horn-drenched \"Writing's on the wall\" and \"Stay too long\" (with a Rocky Hendrix feel and rapped bridge).The lovely \"She said\" is lilting with parping horns and a rapped section, while the ballad \"Welcome to hell\" (chronicling Banks arrival at prison) sounds rather heavenly, complete with a choir. \"The recluse\" is upbeat with a dizzying string section, while \"Prayin'\" and the horn-driven \"What you gonna do\" (with rapped verses and euphoric sung chorus) are both retro Soul delights, the latter closest in sound to his debut.Drew handles his translation with much better aplomb than Lil Wayne did, and the album has already topped the UK charts. This is a delightful change in musical direction that is both passionate and beautiful, and which find Drew a major name at the end of the year.\n", "val": 0.022446243092417717}

{"text": "The solo effort `Who Needs Actions When You've Got Words' from British musician Ben Drew, aka `Plan B' flashed major talent but somehow failed to resonate. `Charmaine' stood out, as Drew told the tale of falling for a 14 year old, channeling Musiq's classic `Seventeen'. Though lacking the craftmanship of `Seventeen', `Charmaine' is a a heart felt tale of instincts betraying morals of the sort that usually is found only in the finest of literature and rarely found in song. Despite such moments of gut wrenching storytelling, there were a lot of segments to `Who Needs Action' that fell apart as forced and cliche . . . resoundingly feeling inauthentic.Shortly thereafter came Plan B's `Paint it Blacker' mixtape that led the listener to believe the larger process of melodic songwriting may have been Drew's primary holdback, as simply sitting back and bussin' rhymes over heavy samples allowed him to shine through strongly. As brilliant as the mixtape was broadly, near the end of the mixtape was a genuinely raw and soulful rape and murder ditty called `James Brown is Dead' that displayed a vocal range not effectively used from a male performer since Remy Shand. Clearly . . . HOPEFULLY . . . far from a truthful tale, `James Brown is Dead' still shone off as incredibely, eerily, genuine. The type of track to throw the listener's perception of Drew for a loop. Was Plan B a potentially great MC or was there a more transcendental musician lying underneath the surface dying to get out? The question would soon enough be answered.`The Defamation of Strickland Banks' is an entirely fictional account wherein Drew enacts the persona of a felon soul-singer chasing redemption and forgiveness of the highest order, intimate cries intended only for the mirror and God. Despite the fictional nature of the stories, they ring through as soul-crushingly authentic and strikingly beautiful through tragic nature.In higher brow publications such as `The Atlantic', there has been a large movement of critique of hip-hop that begs the art to come back to it's connection to `the streets', as even the most skilled of rappers substitute cartoonish efforts to shock and show bravado in place of telling the tragic tales of today's broken hearted. Filling this void is where `Plan B' shines through, with tales of mental illness, violence against women and repeat incarceration that leaves one wondering if `Defamation' was a work of fiction or a sance.After a listen through `Defamation', it is apparent that Plan B is a once in a generation talent. Anyone burning up internet message boards with hate messages about artists not keeping it `real' should shut up, put on their headphones, and listen to this diamond of an album.James Brown may be dead, but Ben Drew is very much alive.****** Check out My Amazon Profile ******  or*** Visit SiafuSounds.com To View All My Reviews ***\n", "val": 0.0033214350696653128}

I really feel like he just threw darts at songs he liked to fill in the album- Probably the worst song every made in the history of christian music, \"Running just to catch myself\", in which he tries to imitate Weird Al Yankavich and sings about wearing a speedo, is included on this album. This song is absolutely horrible and was never even popular, and he puts it right dab in the middle of the album.

Nonetheless, after wearing out two original LPs, I was happy to discover the first of the three Rounder Records was out on CD and bought it immediately.As I usnderstand, and you can see from the photo, this record was made \"live\" with two microphones, recorded outside after a summer of touring in the early 1970s by the Highwoods String Band.  I was a member of bands on the East Coast that emulated the Highwoods foot-enthralling-stomping style, but there is no substitute for the real thing, and this is it!!! Anyone who was as a Highwoods concert couldn't forget it.I have corresponded with one of the active memebers, Walt Koken, to see if a DVD of portions of Highwoods concerts could be put together, but so far, without success.  A \"Highwoods Live\" album has been produced, on CD, which is excellent.  However, seeing Walt Koken and Bob Potts wind up their fiddles for another old train tune is something not to be believed, unless you have seen it.  I strongly recommend this album, especially to new generations of musicians who are not familiar with the exciting styling of 1920s-30s old-time fiddle band music brought back to life in the 1970s by the Highwoods String Band.\n", "val": 0.011219196952879429}

{"text": "I discovered Brotha Lynch Hung with \"Dinner and a Movie\". this is the 2nd installment to his concept trilogy. I absolutely loved \"Dinner and a Movie\" but I have to say \"Coathanga Strangla\" is twice as good. this is the best release of 2011 so far. I can only imagine Tech N9ne's \"All 6s and 7s\" is the only cd capable of topping this. I can't wait for the 3rd installment! if you haven't listened to Brotha Lynch Hung, pick this up today!\n", "val": 0.018982505425810814}
{"text": "The big question with Coathanga Strangla was could Lynch keep the story from Dinner and a Movie going without it getting old or becoming stale? The answer of course he did and not only that he was able 2 make an even better album. Dinner and a Movie was a great album that I consider a classic but Coathanga Strangla is better and Kevin Mann aka Brotha Lynch Hung is able 2 get into the mind of the serial killer \"The Coathanga Strangla\" that he created on Dinner and a Movie. On Dinner and a Movie Lynch was just terrorizing and cuttin them up and eatin rappers, on Coathanga he is rapping from the perspective of the serial killer he created and does a great job of staying in character. Lynch is a genius and I can't wait to see what he does with Mannibalector, which is scheduled to be the 3rd and final chapter of this Coathanga Strangla 3 ablum trilogy. The skits are great and give this album the feel of something close 2 a movie, each skit serves a purpose and furthers the story telling experience, I don't know if there is a better storyteller in hip-hop right now than Lynch.Top 5 tracks1. #6 Sooner Or Later2. #9 Spit It Out Featuring C.O.S.3. #14 ICU Featuring Tech N9ne4. #3 Mannibalector5. #11 Blinded By DesireIf you want a great album from beginning to end than Coathanga Strangla is definitely worth the money, Brotha Lynch Hung is the man he just dropped 2 classic hip hop albums within a year of each other. This is way better than anything anyone in the mainstream is offering right now, and Lynch deserves 2 get paid 4 what he is doing here. I have no problem giving Lynch my $15 for this CD and I cannot wait 2 do it again next year when the next one comes out. Brotha Lynch Hung is overly underrated and deserves the respect 4 what he is doing, I've been listening 2 hip-hop since 1994 and have been disappointed with most of the crap people are putting out nowadays. Brotha Lynch Hung is one of the few exceptions his stuff is ill and well worth the money, do not download this buy it Lynch deserves the support cause he's the best out right now.\n", "val": 0.007945013232529163}

{"text": "Musician, Poet, Actor and Writer Saul Williams follows up 2007's \"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!\" with his fourth studio album \"Volcanic Sunlight\" and it shows that as always Williams is not your typical hip hop/rapper as he cares little for trends and is more focused on spreading his word through music and this time he has even added elements of pop!Where as the Trent Reznor produced \"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!\"(lets hope the rumours of niggy 2 are true) was full of big beats and powerful vocals \"Volcanic Sunlight\" almost shows Williams softer side. One listen to the title track will prove this as Williams delivers one of his catchiest tracks yet. \"Girls Have More Fun\" has a beat the Beastie Boys would be proud of, it seems Saul wanted to have a bit of fun to go with his serious side. \"Dance\" is a funk filled track and contains a sample from \"Disco '82\" which was featured in the Bollywood movie \"Khud-Daar\", it works brilliantly.People who fear that Saul might be going soft, fear not as one listen to the explosive \"Explain My Heart\" will show as it contains all the elements that make us love Saul in the first place, a hard hitting vocal over some big beats, \"Rocket\", \"Diagram\" and \"Patience\" are all tracks that will become stand out tracks on the album.While on the first couple of listens it might seem Saul might have lost his hard hitting edge, a few listens will prove that wrong and show what a great diverse album this is. After all Saul has never been one to rest on his laurels, anybody who has seen him live will attest to that, whether it be rocking it with a full band or just him and a DJ, Saul always gives 100%. At least we know he means and cares what he raps and rhymes about!\n", "val": 0.011010820977389812}
{"text": "While I am HUGELY biased against all Saul Williams albums NOT co-produced/co-written/co-starring Oscar Winning Musician Trent Reznor, this is a really solid follow-up to 'The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust' and a gigantically amazing incredible follow up to the more recent 'NGH WHT', an album-length recitation of the epic poem of the same name from Williams' poetry book, The Dead Emcee Scrolls, set to a symphony composed by Swiss composer Thomas Kessler and performed by The Arditti String Quartet.This time around, listeners get more pop than poetry, less \"in your face\" and more \"in your radio\", and I think it works well for Williams.His rawness and aggression are still there, but tempered by dance beats, 60's funk licks and the second least aggressive musical instrument in the world: the tambourine.Certain tracks actually sound like radio-friendly singles, until you really listen to the words, at least.One of these, \"Girls Have More Fun\", has a lively drum line accented by a peppy little keyboard riff. Those elements plus a sing-along chorus (\"Girls! Have fun!\") make the listener unable to sit still during it.\"Rocket\" is ridiculously accessible and has an uplifting, cascading sound that feels akin to soaring through space and \"Dance\", the album's first single, makes one want to...eat...cookies...Actually, \"Dance\" might be the most sinister pop song you've ever heard.Something about it feels dangerous...As if you'll start off the evening dancing but end up worshipping some dead god...or maybe that's just me.Whatever the case, it's clear that Williams' time in France has influenced his sound, although there is still an abundance of his usual intense, reflective works on this album.Songs like \"Give It Up\" and the title track are more the slam poetry fans are accustomed to, but even these less poppy works are still less confrontational than songs from his earlier albums.Almost every track features live drums, which range from simple, driving beats to complex, hyper-energetic patterns which serve to almost hypnotize the listener, usually paired up with simple keyboard and/or guitar.And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how much \"Fall Up\" and \"Diagram\", sound as much like TV On The Radio as TV On The Radio's \"Repetition\" (from their latest album 'Nine Types of Light') sounds like Saul Williams.The idea of a Saul Williams/TV On The Radio tour (let's call it the Nine Types of Volcanic Light tour) makes my mouth water...Anyway, while 'Niggy Tardust' and 'NGH WHT' may have frightened off the casual listeners, 'Volcanic Sunlight' is more welcoming to the less adventurous and a great gateway into Williams' deeper, more poetic works such as his self titled effort and his debut, 'Amethyst Rock Star'.Even though this is a more accessible and, dare I say, commercial work, some things remain constant and that include the passion, poetry and heart with which Saul Williams imbues all his works.His fire and intensity as a performer have earned the loyalty of his fans.And, if you're on the fence about Saul Williams, go see him live: your doubts will be erased and you'll be a fan for life.\n", "val": 0.011033035814762115}

{"text": "I bought this album in London last winter before it was available in the USA. I have to say since I bought it I return to it over and over. I have had the chance to see Jonas Kaufmann at the Met now twice and everything I loved about his earlier recordings is even more true for him in person. A striking voice with such power and masculinity. The voice took me by surprise the first time I heard it, but I just adore it now and think he is the tenor of the moment and will likely be for the decade or two. The literature on this album is stunning and Mr. Kaufmann's voice is perfect for the heartfelt and wildly emotional and somewhat dramatic flavor found in the Verismo arias. Do yourself a favor and buy this album right now!\n", "val": 0.04194585233926773}
{"text": "Despite my impatience to see Jonas Kaufmann move into the great Wagner roles, I realise that to rush that process could be fatal to one of the few very great voices singing today and I am delighted by his evident intention to keep his voice still light and flexible enough to sing Mozart, even at this stage of his career. While I do not find that he has the sweetness and \"ping\" ideal for Puccini, he is very fine in Verdi and the movement into verismo is not too great a leap. Kaufmann is now forty; his powerful, smoky voice is now presumably at its peak, and while it will never have the juicy resonance of Corelli he is a superb vocal actor who throws himself into his characterisations and utterly convinces the listener of the sincerity with which he inhabits his roles. There is a plaintive as well as a heroic quality to his singing; he has virtually eliminated the glottal, \"gulping\" tic - presumably injected for emotive effect - which was beginning to infect his vocal production and he now sings \"straight\", relying on tonal colouring and superb control of dynamics. The top B in his \"Come un bel d di maggio\" is appropriately climactic; he then moves straight into a deeply affecting account of that wonderfully melancholy aria \" la solita storia\", using a mesmeric half voice. It is that combination of baritonal heft and restrained delicacy which he can command that makes his voice so moving; he can scale his voice right down to express tenderness then deliver thrilling top A's and B's. It is such a pleasure to hear a singer begin so many arias with due attention to dynamics and subtlety rather than go straight for the \"can belto shock and awe\" attack. Thus \"Dai campi\" builds properly to the climactic \"a meditar\" and is all the better for the contrast Kaufmann engineers between it and the meditative, almost tentative, opening phrases. Similarly, \"Giunto sul passo estremo\" is a genuine psychological portrait; I love the way Kaufmann gives the best possible advocacy to Boito's oft-derided music which I so enjoy. He even shows his command of the fabled \"messa di voce\" (producing a smooth, swelling crescendo and then a diminuendo on one note) - a bel canto technique almost lost amongst modern singers.The opening track is a surprise: a virtually unknown aria from Zandonai's \"Giulietta e Romeo\", a choice typical of a novel, artfully structured programme designed to provide maximum pleasure without recourse to too many old chestnuts - although I suppose no verismo recital would be complete without \"Vesti la giubba\", especially when it is delivered as it is here with such passion and artistry. Another novelty is an aria from Ponchielli's \"I Lituani\"; not especially original as music, perhaps, but a pleasure to hear. I am also delighted to see Kaufmann's inclusion of Refice's exquisite song \"Ombra di nube\", which was made into an immortal gramophone classic by the great Claudia Muzio in one of my favourite recordings. Kaufmann cannot erase memories of her vulnerable, otherworldly poise, but he sings that lovely music with real Innigkeit and actually adopts a \"new\" voice of incomparable tenderness for such a large instrument. With \"Cielo e mar\" we are back on more familiar Ponchielli territory, and once again Kaufmann rethinks the aria to make it a lesson in restrained, poetic power rather than the usual bombastic bawl. One gem follows another and I amazed by the judicious admixture of intelligence and passion that Kaufmann brings to all the music he sings here. The generous recital concludes with a real belter: the final duet from \"Andrea Chnier\", when the lovers declare their undying devotion as they are trundled off to the guillotine. Kaufmann and guest soprano Eva-Marie Westbroek cannot rival Corelli and Stella, or Gigli and Caniglia for that matter, for sheer animal abandon, but it's still a thrilling ride.Pappano's accompaniments are simply superb: great, throbbing waves of sound from the reinvigorated Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia.There are still, perhaps, individual performances of certain arias which I favour over Kaufmann's interpretations here but as a recital disc taken as a whole, it is hard to think of another superior in vocal brilliance, interpretative depth and mature artistry. Kaufmann's voice is virtually - and uncannily at times - indistinguishable from Vickers', who was also criticised for lacking Italianit but still carried the day by dint of conviction and sheer force of personality. But I also think that stylistically Kaufmann is just right for this music even if the vocal make-up lacks that Italianate squillo. He just gets better and better.P.S. Contrary to the official Amazon product description, there is no excerpt from \"Le Villi\" here - in fact there is no Puccini at all.\n", "val": 0.016640881076455116}
{"text": "Verismo is an Italian operatic movement, but we haven't had a fresh leading tenor from Italy in decades, so who is to sing this music? Russians, Americans, Germans? The least likely would appear to be a German tenor like the acclaimed Jonas Kaufmann. Vocal aficionados used to consider the German style of opera singing a separate kettle of fish from the Italian style, and it was all but unknown for the two camps to cross, although an outsider to both like Jon Vickers successfully negotiated the chasm. Vickers is the closest comparison I can make for Kaufmann's approach to these passionate, at times violent arias, which represent probably the most visceral music ever written. (I can hear Vickers' keening vowels in Kaufmann's agonized cry of \"Ridi, pagliaccio.\")Like Vickers, Kaufmann's victory is one of power over finesse. Neither can be considered to have an Italianate voice,  which is supple and seductive. Neither has an ounce of smiling charm--Kaufmann's Turiddu is already doomed as he raises his glass in \"Viva il vino.\" But through sheer courage he wrenches himself into frenzied emotional states that can be hair-raising. In addition, Kaufmann has personal force; you recognize a specific personality throwing itself into the fray. Vickers was gripping in his Verdi roles, even though his Radames sounded \"all wrong,\" and his Otello was like a suicidal Christ -- there was little romance before the hero's suffering engulfed him.When he made his first album of arias, I prayed that Kaufmann would be the Wagner tenor the opera world so desperately needed; unless Domingo lived forever, it seemed as if we would never hear a first-class Parsifal, Lohengrin, or Siegmund for another decade. Yet I foresaw that for classical record labels the real money was in Puccini and Verdi. Kaufmann quickly went on to sing a rather beefy but charismatic Pinkerton to Gheorgiu's Butterfly. Happily, he didn't ignore the German repertoire, and now he has grown into Lohengrin and Siegmund as well as Cavaradossi. So the two worlds are merging, and out of gratitude for such a sterling singer, one gifted with excellent intonation and musical instinct, we might as well forget the division between Verdi and Wagner.  The voice has grown darker very rapidly, and yet there is still enough ping at the top -- what the Italians call squillo -- to bring a thrill. I don't think Kaufmann will return to the Mozart and Schubert roles of his youth (he will turn 42 this summer), and with Otello in front of him, Alfredo is getting farther behind.This album was held up for a disgracefully long time since its initial release in Europe, and perhaps its release  in the U.S. has been timed with Kaufmann's appearance in 'Die Walkure' at the Met.  His Siegmund was a clamorous triumph, but I notice very little stir here at Amazon. Are record buyers stuck back in the age of Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras in their prime? If so, they are missing a tenor who is worthy to stand beside them. (Pappano adds a gratifying amount of musicality, too, leading impeccable orchestral and choral forces.)\n", "val": 0.006839278154075146}

In my opinion, no tenor since Jon Vickers and Franco Corelli has possessed a heroic instrument to equal this young German's. The voice, large and baritonal, is aboslutely unique, his musicianship is indivudual and compelling, his way with the text is that of a gifted actor --specific and insightful-- in short, this is the dramatic tenor we have been waiting for. But he is more: a dramatic tenor who is equally commanding in the spinto repertoire as well as a fine lieder singer. A truly great tenor has arrived.\n", "val": 0.0413692332804203}
{"text": "Jonas Kaufmann continues to amaze. Not only has he become one of the most popular and loved recitalists (six encores at his recent Los Angeles recital of lieder) who has successfully entered the arena of brilliant lieder singers, but he also has such a magnificent baritone-colored tenor voice and sports such a fitting physique on the stage that he is a natural to be cast in the versimo operas. And that is what he delivers generously on this new release. Collaborating with Antonio Pappano and theAccademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia Jonas Kaufmann is sure to gain an even wider audience with his intelligent, well-focused masculine tenor with which he adds to the definition of 'verismo'  - the realism of operatic literature.The selection on this recording is wide ranging, another suggestion that Kaufmann is not satisfied to fill a CD with the expected.  Some of the arias are Enrico Caruso favorites while others are from rarely heard operas today.  For example he offers  arias from 'Giulietta e Romeo'  composed by Zandonai, 'I Lituani' by Ponchelli, Leoncavallo's 'La Boheme' (instead of opting of the popular Puccini version), and the incredibly beautiful 'Ombra di nube' by Licinio Refice (1883 - 1954) - a priest and composer few have ever heard.  But Kaufmann does not rest on his intellect of introducing arias for the novelty of it all.  He graciously includes the great 'Pagliacci' aria of Leoncavallo, two arias from Mascagni's 'Cavalleria rusitcana',  two arias from Boito's 'Mefistofele', memorable interpretations from Giordano's 'Andrea Chenier' and 'Fedora' , and from Francesco Cil&egrave;a's operas 'L'Arlesiana' and 'Adriana Lecouvreur'.Some may feel this voice is too large for the tenor styles and sounds  we are used to hearing in these roles, but Jonas Kaufmann's burnished bronze tone does not hamper him from tackling the very high notes with complete ease but his vocal control is so polished that he is able to deliver the pianissimos with equal ease and beauty of timbre.  This is a remarkable recital by a gifted tenor - now equally at home in the Italian roles as he is the master of the German repertoire. Highly Recommended.

{"text": "Jonas Kaufmann has of late been a sensation in the operatic world. The frenzy actually got its momentum from his Grammophone Award recording of Strauss's lieder.I have got most, if not all, of Kaufmann's DVDs and vocal albums. Like most German tenors, he started out as a 'lyrical tenor' singing Mozart and Schubert and some baroque roles. Indeed, he has been a strikingly good interpretor even in his earlier years.His debut album for Decca was 'Romantic Arias' for tenor. That album contained mostly Italian (and a number of French) operatic arias, and he struck me as being better in the French stuff than the Italian.Hence it is not without trepidation that I approached his recent solo release on Italian 'verismo' opera arias.An instant relief was gained when I finished off the second track and approahced the third. Yes - the album is a consistently high-standard performance of some of the most dramatically intense operatic arias.Kaufmann is never 'Italianate' in the same way as Corelli or del Monaco, nor Placido Domingo. However, he is nonetheless an exceptionally intelligent interpretor, and actually succeeds admirably in forming his own verismo style with a wonderful deployment of his unique timbre.No - his is NOT the 'successor' of Placido Domingo, nor Jon Vickers, nor of any one, in fact. With his ravishingly expressive voice and wonderful characterisations, he IS a new phenomenon - the 'Kaufmann Phenomenon'.Indeed, his performance in this album is nowhere short of being phenomenal. His former slight restrictions in Italian repertoire have become 'former' - one immediately senses a big step forward both in terms of vocal production and musical style. The arias from 'Andrea Chenier', 'Cavaliar Rusticana', 'Francesca di Rimini' and 'Adriana Lecouvreur' are familiar enough for the listeners to draw immediate comparisons with the past top interpretors. One would not need to hesitate, upon listening to Kaufmann, to warm up to the luscious singing and wonderful new interpretations.\n", "val": 0.03026289865374565}

{"text": "On April 14th 2010, Jonas Kaufmann became the first German tenor in 103 years to sing Cavaradossi (from Puccini's \"Tosca\") in the New York Met. On November 18th he was be the first to play the role of Maurizio in \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" (Cilea) which has not been performed in Covent Garden since 1906. In midst of all these landmarks appears the \"Verismo Arias\" (Decca) album, which has been qualified as one of the most extraordinary opera recitals recorded in recent years. The repertoire does not include Puccini because, in Kaufmann's words: \"Italians separate Puccini from verismo. There's a certain delicacy and elegance in him which are not to be found in verismo which is rougher and more violent.\"The album starts with \"Giulietta e Romeo\" by Riccardo Zandonai. This is Romeo's great scene and aria, \"Giulietta, son io\", in which the young Montague weeps over his lover's tomb. \"I doubt that more personal feelings could ever be put into music. To listen to it is like intruding into someone's intimacy\", says Kaufmann, who reaches a straining point with a devilish fiato in an obscure music which allows him nevertheless to deliver very moving subtleties. After hearing this, it's not hard to foresee what he will do with the final scene of \"Otello\" (Verdi).The breadth of his crescendo, the internal vibration of each word, the vigor of his \"recitativo\", his multiple tones, his torrid sensuality which becomes lyricism, his nuances and pianissimos, and his huge range make one wonder whether there is something that Kaufmann should not sing. \"He has everything,\" wrote The New York Times in its review of the album.Kaufmann never dreamt of one day being able to do \"Vesti la giubba\" (\"I Pagliacci\" by Leoncavallo), in which he highlights Canio's bitterness and brutality, or the \"Cavalleria Rusticana\" (Mascagni) arias, with Turiddu transformed into a frightened little boy in \"Mamma, quel vino  generoso\", but now both operas form a part of his Metropolitan risky double programme. \"This music not only causes physical and emotional weariness, but it is also mentally tiresome. It is hard to remain the same after singing this repertoire. One has to abandon oneself to the music,\" he says.As occurs with Zandonai's Romeo, it seems as though one were prying into the intimacy of Kaufmann himself. It happens with \"Amor ti vieta\" (very brief and brimming with passion); in the arias of Maurizio (elegant as rarely to be seen in verismo, specially \"La dolcissima efigie\", in which the main character compares Adriana's beauty to his flag... and also in the weariness and despair of \"L'anima ho stanca\"), and particularly in the fragments of \"Andrea Chnier\" (Giordano): his \"Improvviso\" is of an overwhelming and overpowering eloquence, and contrasts with the lyrical rapture with which he performs \"Come un bel d di Maggio\". In the duet \"Vicino a te\" he forms an ideal couple with Eva Maria Westbroek, who has a huge and gorgeous voice.The record also includes \"Lamento di Federico\" from \"L'Arlesiana\" (Cilea), which Kaufmann has transformed into a memorable part of his recitals by proposing a trip from the initial intimate confidence of \" (...) e s'addormi\" to the despair of \"Mi fai tanto male! Ahim!\"; the interesting \"Testa adorata\" from Leoncavallo's forgotten \"Bohme\"; two fragments from \"Mefistofele\" (Boito); \"S, questa estrema grazia\", from \"I Lituani\", and \"Cielo e mar!\", from \"La Gioconda\", both by Ponchielli, and another rarity, the lovely song \"Ombra di nube\" by Licinio Refice.

{"text": "I jumped on this Daily Deal when I saw it June 6, 2011 at the special price of $3.99 for over 2 hours of Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grapelli, two of the towering figures in the history of jazz. They invented a whole new style of music in roughly 1933 and continued playing with some major wartime interruptions until about 1948 with their Quintet of the Hot Club of France.Reinhardt was a gypsy musician who developed his completely unique style after a fire at age 18 that cost him most of the use of two fingers on his left hand. He was able to partially use those fingers when strumming chords, but all those blazing solos you hear are with just two fingers -- which meant that he became a major influence and inspiration for other guitarists with partially missing fingers, such as Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.Stephane Grapelli also invented a new style of violin playing that fit with Reinhardt perfectly. Grapelli's playing is absolutely sweet and clear, and I always picture him playing with a smile on his face, like in the concert videos I've seen of him later in life.I haven't owned any Reinhardt/Grapelli since back in the LP days, so I was very happy to see this set on sale here today. A lot of my favorites by these guys are here -- such as their smoking versions of classics like \"Honeysuckle Rose\", \"I Got Rhythm\" and \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" or Reinhardt originals like \"Djangology\", \"Daphne\" or the brooding \"Nuages\".The recordings are all from before or right after World War II, so don't expect modern sound technology. But these are decent transfers to MP3. I didn't hear any real problems with the sound, although on a lot of the tracks you clearly hear record needle noise.

{"text": "Alex Clare's introduction to the Western world will perhaps best be remembered by a commercial for the new Internet Explorer which features Clare's single 'Too Close' - which is also arguably the best track on this album. Clare's style is a haunting electronica-laced chill mixed with dubstep sound reminiscent of acts like Rob Dougan. Clare will often use vocals and instrumentation with great effect, though lyrically some songs do fall flat.If you're a fan of 'Too Close', the rest of the album will not disappoint!

{"text": "There is a soulfulness to Alex Clare's voice that cannot be ignored.  In fact, when I first heard `Too Close' I actually thought it was James Morrison trying his hand at a more rock centered sound.  Yes, Alex Clare delivers some depth to the proceedings by allowing a grovel and an honesty pierce his music.  It isn't always enough to keep the album relevant, but for the most part `The Lateness of the Hour' proves to be a worthwhile endeavor for both Clare and us.While `Too Close' certainly got our attention, it is in the softer, quieter moments that this album truly shines.  Songs like `Relax My Beloved' and `Whispering' allow Clare to develop a deeper sound and more personal connection through the subtle music and his entrancing tone.  Songs like `Up All Night' and `Humming Bird' develop the rock sound Clare is trying to establish (a notch below `Too Close' with catchier elements) and they prove successful as a whole.  `Hands Are Clever' breaks up what feels like an almost too routine sound with some jazzy Southern charm.  But there is where my main complaint for this album lies; it does sound very `matchy matchy'.  The album sounds so `put together' with almost every track leading into the next with a sound that is very similar.  While I understand that this can be a plus (at least it doesn't feel disjointed) it can also lead to a feeling of monotony.  It doesn't help that some songs, namely `Tightrope', feel devoid of life.Still, the highs here are worthy of note and really, Alex Clare does offer something interesting to modern music.  His vocals have a very aged soulful sound, and his musical direction has a very modern progressive pop rock sound, so marrying the two together can produce something interesting.  I look forward to where his career takes him.  Despite some aforementioned issues (and the way he says `Sanctuary') I actually like this album, at least in parts, and recommend taking a peak!\n", "val": 0.018702873960137367}

I'm rarely impressed, but the album blew me away with its original sound and Alex's voice.  He certainly has some healthy lungs...I can't scream that loud.  Overall, it's the vocals with the electronic, industrial sounds mixed with a very precise beat that I can't get enough of.The only problem is that when one of these songs come up in my playlist, for some reason, my foot gets a little heavier.

After hearing the full version of the song, which has now started to pick up speed here, on a radio station in Massachusetts, I bought the record.  I was not expecting how amazing it was!! I've listened to the album almost daily since I bought it!  It combines everything from electronic and dance music, to jazz and motown, and what it creates is an exceptionally brilliant album.  If you don't like electronic type music, don't get it, because that's the dominant genre on the record.  He also has a hauntingly melodic voice that's beautiful with the music as the backdrop.

Most of the songs are slower and about half of them have that electronic wave sound (not sure what too call it). On some of the songs the wave sound feels a little off (I don't listen to a whole lot of techno so I'm probably just not used to it). That being said, the sophistication of the tracks and the amazing control and range of Clare's voice make for a great album all the way through.\n", "val": 0.020933454856276512}

His voice. The lyrics. I decided to look up some other songs and realized he is more than just a one hit wonder. Song after song I loved. Some more than others yes but I did enjoy them all in different ways. He can dig into your heart with a ballad, make you want to punch something with the beats, or make you run around in circles in ecstasy.I'm thankful that artists with pure talent are coming to the forefront of the music industry. An artist isn't talented because computers makes their voice sound nice. Alex Clare is talent, smooth, powerful. Check out some of his acoustic stuff as well.

Another reviewer tuned into Clare's ability to marry a great melody, powerful lyric and emotional vocal delivery similar to fellow Londoner Adele's music.

{"text": "Don't worry that the breakout single Too Close is the only song with dubstep, and this is your typical \"one hit wonder\" type of CD.  But then, not every song has dubstep, either.  The first track, Up All Night, made my inner punk rocker happy, and the dark driving beats of Relax My Beloved spoke to the dark places in my soul.  Of course the phenominal Too Close is just way too cool of a song.  But I'm sure you already know that or you wouldn't be checking out this review.  So far, the other song that really stands out to me is Whispering; a melancholy, twisting lullaby that sung me to sleep in my head the first night after hearing it.  \"The Lateness of the Hour\" has usurped the much coveted \"leave in the CD player to listen to whenever I feel like listening to something\" that Florence + the Machine has long held.

{"text": "Thank you England.  Alex Clare's THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR is the best debut I've heard since Of Monster and Men's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MY-HEAD-IS-AN-ANIMAL/dp/B007MU85D0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MY HEAD IS AN ANIMAL</a>.  Now, I know that both of these albums were released in 2012, but hey, I can't help it if it's been a good year for music.  Regardless of how good the year has been, British singer/songwriter Alex Clare's debut album is pretty fantastic.  Originally released overseas in 2011, it's proving to be one of 2012's most successful and interesting debuts.At this point, Clare is most famous for his song appearing in a commercial.  The lead single \"Too Close\" has been featured in Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 advertisement. Unfortunately for Microsoft, the attention that the commercial seems to be gaining is more due to the music than the actual advertisement.  The song is quite characteristic of the album in many ways: the focus is on Clare's lyrics and soulful vocals.  The melody is at the forefront of the song -- the electronic and dubstep instrumentation takes a backseat to the melody.  Opening track \"Up All Night\" uses a tribal and rhythmic chant to propel it through its running time; it's one of the hardest hitting tracks on the album.  \"Treading Water\" sounds similar to \"Too Close,\" -- the dubstep influence is certainly clear -- but it's a great song in its own right.  \"Hands Are Clever\" serves as a highlight for me; it's a track that flirts with R&B instrumentation and shoots for the moon with its catchy hook.  The final track \"I Won't Let You Down\" is probably the most traditional of the tracks here.  It's composed of Clare's vocals and an accompanying piano; it's a bare and organic ending to an album that feels slickly produced.What bounds Clare's album together is his intense and soulful vocal delivery.  I would recommend THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR to listeners interested in alternative music -- there's plenty of material here for people to love.  The album is an incredibly enjoyable listen that proves to be remarkably consistent.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Too-Close/dp/B007VF2PAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Too Close</a>,\" \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hands-Are-Clever/dp/B007VF2QJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hands Are Clever</a>,\" and \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Up-All-Night/dp/B007VF2MIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Up All Night</a>.\"  Don't miss out on this album.\n", "val": 0.019051359966397285}

Like a lot of people, I was drawn in by the Internet Explorer commercial featuring \"Too Close\". To me, it might be the best song on the album, but it does have stiff competition. Treading Water, Up All Night, and Whispering are also great songs. I prefer his faster songs to his slower songs that you find later in the album, but those are still solid. At times he reminds me of a male version of Adele, sometimes a Matt Kearney, with almost a rap style delivery. The beats vary from bluesy to a slow and ballad pace to a dub-step club sound you find on \"Too Close\".

His voice soars and the emotions just flows out of him.  Check out some of his live videos on YouTube, that should sell you if my words don't.\n", "val": 0.023712897673249245}

{"text": "I, like most, heard Too Close on the internet explore commercial. my wife looked up the song, i listened a few times and then came back to this album yesterday. Alex Clare ROCKS!. I'm not big into Dubstep, but I love all types of electronic blends of music and especially when an artist or band blends different styles into one, Alex, along with Diplo and Switch (who produced the album) knock this out of the park. All the songs rock, with great soulful singing, mashed up with tremendous bass and synths that vibrate your ears or your speakers. Too Close is the standout track, but UP All NIGHT starts things off Great. The cover of When Doves Cry, is awesome as well.it's a shame that most people think of dance or electronic is all pop (lady gaga, david guetta stuff) and yet, no promotions/marketing behind this album and it's a gem. Let's face it, most commercials these days have often some kind of dancy song and alot of times it's just a one time hit, but then if you dig a little deeper you can find a hidden Gem like Alex Clare- cannot wait to see what his next album and future music sounds like. Keep it up Alex, Diplo and Switch...Cheers!\n", "val": 0.010618572123348713}

{"text": "I had never heard of Alex Clare until the day I researched him. I saw the commercial for Microsoft and thought I love that song. The song was \"Too Close\" I found out who the artist was and went on Amazon to see if he had an album. I was happy to see that he did. The album The Lateness of The Hour is fantastic.He has the blend of Maroon 5 and Adele. He can do the fast number and then kill you with a tender ballad. I hope more people will give him a try.

{"text": "Like others have said, I got my first taste of Alex Clare with the Microsoft commercial.  I was a bit suprised when I searched for him on Amazon that he only had one album.  He also seems to not have hit popularity in the United States (I believe he is gaining popularity in U.K.). I can say for sure that if he can get his music out he's gonna hit big United States.He has an extremely unique sound; a mix of rock, soul, and dubstep.  Which is a crazy combination of genres, but it's fantastic!  While \"Too Close\" (song from Microsoft commercial) is probably still my favorite song, his album serves as a perfect complement.  This is an amazing album, and it's even more impressive that it's his first.  Do yourself a favor, and buy this!\n", "val": 0.02865789085626602}

{"text": "\"Make it Loud\" - the next installment from psalmist, praise/worship, encourager of the brethren, Martha Munizzi. Purchasing the advance sale and getting my copy days later, I knew it would be good, just given Martha's track of success singing praises to our Lord. But after experiencing ALL these excellent selections - she and all her instrumentalists have taken it to the next level - again! From the start \"Make it Loud\" makes you get up, want to move something, and SHOUT praises to God. Great song, great hook, easily rememberable and brings you into His presence in a strong, bold way.  So many great songs - personal favorites are Make it Loud, Excellent, My God is a Big God, and Until for starters. Her daughter appears on the album with a song she's written - excellent. The line up of collaborations are excellent as well. You will not go wrong purchasing this excellent production. I'm telling you now - be prepared for a great journey - move, dance, sing, praise, worship - it's all packaged here. Excellent job Martha and team - thank you for being a critical force in advancing the kingdom through praise and worship music.

{"text": "Incubus has a new single and upcoming album?  FINALLY!  I almost never purchase music anymore (Pandora), but Incubus has been by and far my favorite band since 2000 and definitely deserve the support.  Not only that, but I've seen these guys in concert over 5-6 times over the years and their live performances are insane.  Taking time to do a 30-45 acoustic jam session for their fans in Phoenix Arizona?  AMAZING!  Having met the band, they're ridiculously down to earth and seemingly great people in addition to being fantastic musicians.  Ok....to this song.  It's definitely a more whimsical addition to the Incubus library.  Is it my favorite?  No......is it a great song?  Ya, its awesome.  Just great to hear my favorite band making music again.  INCUBUS!  Please tell me you recorded your studio acoustic sessions in Chile!?!?Edit 7/12/2011 - This new single had some promise and maybe I thought it was a slower picture of amazingness to come.  How utterly wrong I was.  I read some of the reviews around the internet and in many ways they're 100% correct.  It's almost as if Incubus lost its way completely.  Like someone got hit on the head, woke up famous and completely forgot how they got there.  The new CD is laughable and nothing other than terrible and forgettable.  After listening to the Foo Fighters new CD, I thought \"WOW!  Bands can still make amazing music.\"  Which only made this situation that much worse.  Adolescent is the only song on the entire album that anywhere near resembles Incubus.  Where's the unique turn tables mixed against hard charging guitar?  This CD sounds like something my Mom would listen to (shes in her late 50s).  It's boring, ambiguous and nothing Incubus.  People say \"well they've matured!  Their sound is different.\"  There's a difference between maturing and changing who you are completely.  Eminem has come into his own and \"matured\" his sound.....meaning he made it a better more confident rendition of who he is/was.  He didn't turn to Opera and claim it's him \"maturing.\"There's no maturing to this album, if anything it's just a transition into a bad Coldplay/U2 ballad cover band.  They took five years off and forgot who they were.  Brandon lost his edge...the band lost it's edge......they're no longer unique in literally any way, shape or form.  Before I was worried Incubus would make a bad album.....now I'm concerned Incubus has just become a terrible band.\n", "val": 0.0021690463181585073}

The songs are well written, the lyrics deep and meaningful while also being twisted and dark, and the production is crisp and fresh. Nikki Sixx is the driving creative force behind most of the music, and he dives deep into meandering emotions through epic melodies. The result is an intriguing mix of sounds and passions. Words that come to mind when listening are raw and powerful. His music captures all of his creative qualities: his love, rage, optimism, darkness, and determinism. The title track is a great way to start off the album and features some killer bass playing. \"Lies of the Beautiful\" has catchy riffs and amazing vocals, and tackles contradictions in society with Sixx urging listeners to look beneath the skin. \"Live Forever\" delivers with a sonic boom and features an incredible guitar solo. \"Sure Feels Right\" is a stunning change to the overall sound: the guitar and bass are soothing and the vocals entwine perfectly with the music. \"Skin\" shows Nikki's deeper side and is a statement about beauty without prejudice. There is not one filler song on the album, and listening closely to the music and lyrics will definitely make you react, which is what I think Nikki had in mind. Highly recommended!!!\n", "val": 0.05065383017063141}

It's not the difference in style, it is the lack of that one song that will be played on radio stations across the country for 30 plus years I'm talking about. This band had a couple songs in this category on their last CD. It's funny, I actually find this to be a stronger album start to finish than their debut release but the songs that really grab you on their debut album fit the, \"WOW\" category, and I just didn't walk away from that here (listened to it twice so far).

{"text": "Sixx: A.M.'s second album,'This Is Gonna Hurt' is one of the best albums out there. After sampling all the songs on their website I knew buying this would not be a mistake. It proves that if the best in the music buisness come together it can sound just that,the best in the buisness. 'This Is Gonna Hurt',another soundtrack to Nikki Sixx's autobiography,isn't like the first one,'The Heroin Diaries'.And that's a good thing because let's face it,it was pretty dark,as it should have been. This one is more kick-a** than dark,with some very well-written lyrics. 'Are You With Me' is the best one on here which has an up-beat rock rythm to it. 'This Is Gonna Hurt' is original,in a VERY good way. Tracks like 'Sure Feels Right','Smile' & 'Skin' are slower with alot of heart behind them. 'Oh My God' is my favorite song as it says what everyone knows,this world can get better. It packs so much emotion in it you can't help but feel it yourself while listening.I can't ignore 'Live Forever',a clever love song. 'Dealihood',a clever revenge/breakup song.'Help Is On The Way' dips into Nikki's past. The same can be said about 'Goodbye My Friends'.And of course,the wildly popular 'Lies Of The Beautiful People.'All in All,VERY good,regardless if you liked or dislike 'The Heroin Diaries'.Do yourself a big favorand get this album,I gaurantee it won't disappoint.\n", "val": 0.027598846703767776}

{"text": "I really loved The Heroin Diaries, and purchased this CD expecting more of the same. While it is undeniably the same band, TIGH is not quite as hard-edged. The title track is the clear-cut rocker-song on the album - a great way to open the CD. \"Lies of the Beautiful People\" - lyrically, this is obviously a theme that has done before, and done to death. Nikki likes to make it out like he's some philosophical genius, but this song's theme has actually been done to death. Still a very cool song, though! James Michael's vocals are simply amazing, very versatile! And DJ Ashba's guitar work is amazing as well. Track 3 - \"Are You With Me Now\" - is my personal favorite. I see a lot of reviews bagging on that song due to its commercial feel. That doesn't bother me. Who says a rock song can't have a catchy hook? Maybe it doesn't sound like some genre-breaking masterpiece, but so what? The lyrics are easy to relate to, and the chorus is super catchy. The only criticism I have is the track \"Sure Feels Right\". It's a very cool, mellow tune, but has a definite country-music overtone to it, and doesn't seem suited to this band or the CD. It does demonstrate the band's versatility, but it's kind of a misfit song in the midst of the others.The ballad that ends the album, \"Skin\", is getting a lot of attention. I have the same problem with this song as I have with \"Lies of the Beautiful People\". It's a good song, but the topic has been done to death before, and it's not that ground-breaking or profound piece that so many people are making it out to be. The piano is wonderful, though, and James's vocals, as always, are phenomenal.Honestly, I was kind of so-so about the album when I first listened to it, but after repeated listens, it really grew on me. I enjoy listening to every song on here now. I have definite favorites, but I no longer skip through it.Don't buy this album if you're expecting a hard-rocking ride all the way through. But there's a little something for everyone in here - those who can appreciate different genres and types of music will really enjoy this. Those close-minded \"Metal or die\" types who think that if music doesn't rock hard, it sucks...you won't enjoy this. Personally, I appreciate diversity in my music, so Sixx:AM gets 5 stars from me :)\n", "val": 0.006839076057076454}
{"text": "I sampled a couple of tunes before buying this cd and I must admit it really rocks.  The production is great as are the arrangements.

I've been immensely enjoying \"The Herion Diaries\" for a couple of years now(definitely a desert island disc for me),and so didn't hesitate when the oppourtunity came to pick this release up.This outing is a bit more \"Hit Song\" oriented than the last album, which it seems was somewhat more riff oriented and had musical shades of light and dark within each song. These songs are either full-blown or moody unto themselves, as opposed to mixing it up within a given track.Nonetheless, these three guys, as a band, seem to click in ways that most bands/artists only strive for. As a songwriting team they are almost unmatched. The level of musical craftsmanship on display here, coupled with such thought-provoking lyrics, outshines much of what sits on the shelves in the entertainment marketplace today. James Michael has one of the purest vocies I've ever heard and is a great drum programmer(something I typically despise)and producer.If these guys stick together, they could well become THE songwriting team for the next decade or more. Axl had better take advantage of D.J. while he has him, because I could see Sixx: A.M. becoming the next supergroup without much to stand in their way.\n", "val": 0.00659255450591445}

{"text": "Well I gotta admit that my first impressions of this album were not good, but it has turned out to be another case of not taking too much notice of songs posted on YouTube.  That's probably a good avenue to watch officially released film clips or to get a snippet of something from the forthcoming album of an artist that you like or are familiar with.  But if it's an artist you aren't totally into or haven't heard before, then I think it's well worth giving the album a fair go before making judgments and This Is Gonna Hurt is proof of that.Yes this is Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx's baby, but really his playing isn't that outstanding that you'd actually know he was here at all if it wasn't his name on the cover.  On the other hand, current Guns N Roses guitarist DJ Ashba is all over it and proves that he really is one talented dude.  As well as handling guitars, I read somewhere that apparently he wrote most of the music and programmed the drums, and I really am hoping that he and Axl give us something new within the decade!  James Michael also shows us here that he is a very competent singer with quite a good voice, without being brilliant.Stylistically this album is very hard to categorise because there are many completely different styles of music on offer here.  At times I hear the modern rock sound of 30 Seconds To Mars, particularly on Are You With Me (my favorite song on the album) and I hear a U2 sound on Oh My God (my equal favorite song on the album).  Then there's the country-pop flavored semi-ballad Sure Feels Right, the mellow piano and string instruments on Skin, and the hard hitting modern rock flavour on songs like the title track and Lies Of The Beautiful People (another two of my favorites).  There's also the piano and acoustic guitar ballad Smile which is quite a mellow song but I love it.  The other ballads on this album don't really work for me but this one sure does.  I'm convinced that the reason for this is because it sounds so much like an Aerosmith ballad that it actually sounds a little weird that Steven Tyler isn't actually singing it, that's how much of a fit I think it is for him.The thing is with an album like this which varies so much stylistically there's bound to be some songs that just don't really do it for me (and probably most people who listen to it actually).  It's a total contrast of peaks and valleys with the former being the songs I've already mentioned that I like, and the latter being the awful Goodbye My Friends and Deadlihood (and why is it that Nikki Sixx has to have at least one song with \"Hollywood\" in the lyrics on just about every album he does?)  There are also the average songs in Live Forever, Help Is On The Way, Sure Feels Right and Skin which aren't really bad songs but aren't anything special and fall way short of the really good songs that are on this album.Then there are the lyrics on Skin which get right up my nose.  Maybe they might strike a chord with the drop-outs, the disadvantaged, or the disenfranchised youth of the Y generation who feel underappreciated and full of self pity, but I don't fit into any of those categories.  So I just find the lyrics annoying and can't help thinking \"get over it buddy and take a big swig of harden-the-f__k-up!\"On the other hand I find the lyrics of Oh My God quite poignant and thought provoking.  In total contrast to Skin the lyrics of this song really do strike a chord with me in a way in which I can't actually recall lyrics doing for a very long time.  When I listen to this song it does make me wonder why there is such a divide and inequality in our society and indeed why have we become immune to seeing tragedy and suffering unfolding before us on the 24 hour a day TV news?  I also find I question myself as to whether I have personally done (or am I doing) enough for my fellow man during my short existence on this planet?Hmmm... pretty deep stuff for one of my reviews.

{"text": "\"This is gonna hurt\" is the second, brand new album by \"Sixx A.M.\", the band of \"Motley Crue\" mastermind and bassist Nikki Sixx. Much like its predecessor \"The heroin diaries\", the new album is based on the auto-biographical book of the same name.On this second studio effort Nikki reunites with lead guitarist James Michael and lead singer DJ Ashba who also handles keyboards, drums and programming.  With a stable line up you can rightfully expect the same musical recipe of the debut. For that matter you get a rather modern version of Sleaze metal emphasizing instrumental melodies and vocal harmonies with intriguing arrangements, often adding orchestral parts, acoustic backing instruments and piano. Above all, the end result is incredibly catchy, offering some of the most memorable hooks. Favourite tracks include \"Help is on the way\", \"This is gonna hurt\", \"Lies of the beautiful people\", \"Live forever\" and \"Goodbye my dear friends\".Indeed \"This is gonna hurt\" is another well arranged offering from Sixx's band that definitely stands on its own regardless of whether the listener has actually read the book counterpart. Each song has such a developed musical personality standing differentiated from the rest and it is this quality that makes the album an enjoyably listen from start to finish; perhaps making one wish that the band included more songs on it. \"This is gonna hurt\" is a must for any fan of Sleaze metal, \"Motley Crue\", \"Bad City\" or \"Black veil Brides\".\n", "val": 0.01829027757048607}

{"text": "To begin, I must say that I loved the first Sixx A.M. album The Heroin Diaries which accompanied Nikki Sixx's book of the same name.  It didn't take more than a single listen of \"Life is Beautiful\" to become a fan of the band. At the time the concept of a soundtrack to a book was different and was a new concept to me, looking back I have to say it worked. Almost four years latter Sixx A.M.'s second album This Is Gonna Hurt is released, once again a book by the same name has been released shortly before. I really anticipated this second album as The Heroin Diaries was my favorite out of Nikki Sixx's side projects. The first Sixx A.M. album was fantastic; it was very honest, dark and twisted. I felt that it was reflective of Nikki's life and I could relate to that (and so did many other fans).The title track kick starts the album with a bang, this is an anthem and fist-pumping track, it has a \"you and me against the world\" type of feeling to it. Unfortunately, the title track is a heavy and rocking as the album gets, everything that follows it is slower or softer, not heavier. When I first heard the single, \"Lies of the Beautiful People\" I admit that I was slightly disappointed but the song grew on me and gets better with each listen.  \"Are You With me\" is I feel, one of the strongest songs of the album, I love the chorus the song just works. When James sings the chorus with the \"come back from the dead\" part I get chills, it's such a great vocal performance and so passionate. \"Deadlihood\" was another song I really liked. \"Help Is On the Way\" has a great message and it rocks, nice build-up to the chorus. \"Skin\" is a lyrical highlight for the band, the lyrics are so personal, honest and touching which was probably the point. It's also very simple with James singing, a piano and orchestra in the background. It closes the album nicely.This Is Gonna Hurt is overall a softer album and a bit less intense which is not necessarily a bad thing but I expected more rockers I suppose. This time around it feels somewhat less original; I don't have that special feeling, that connection with the lyrics from the first album. On its own This Is Gonna Hurt is a good album that has more of a modern feel to it. If you're a fan of the first I think this album is worth it as there are definitely some great songs worth listening to. I just wasn't blown away like I was with the first Sixx A.M. album, maybe if I never heard the debut I'd like this one much more. TIGH is a strong sophomore release from Sixx A.M., the band sounds tight. James Michaels proves himself once more as a vocalist and delivers a terrific performance. DJ Ashba is killer on guitar and Nikki is well...Nikki!This Is Gonna Hurt is very much a continuation of TIHD, it's similar in many ways and it has a depth and beautiful lyrics but I feel that this time around while it works, it doesn't work as well as it did with the first album. It's a good follow up to the band's first album and it has its moments, I wouldn't say that it's as good but the ride is still enjoyable this time around.  I don't know, perhaps it was the point I was at in my life when the album was released or maybe I identified more with The Heroin Diaries for some reason. I realize that I've made a lot of comparisons to the first album but that's just me, on its own body of work this is a very good album with once again some excellent lyrics, great guitar work and some solid vocals, it works.  I wouldn't say This Is Gonna Hurt amazed me and I can't say it's a disappointment either because there is a lot of enjoyable music here, I just feel some reviewers are rating it a little higher than it perhaps deserves. It sounds a lot like what the bands of today are coming up with, maybe a little too much. For me I'd say this is a 3 stars out of 5, enough to keep fans coming back.\n", "val": 0.021087801083922386}
{"text": "I heard Nikki Sixx being interviewed on the Mark and Brian show over a month ago. Nikki is a cool and awesome guy in my book. Based on this interview, I bought Sixx-AM sound unheard. I am sadly disappointed overall. While there are some great guitar hooks and musicianship in this band, I will never fully appreciate it, because I have to force myself to listen to it. This sounds like 95% of commercial hard rock out there to me, overall generic and sterile. If you are into that, then by all means, buy this disc. Unfortunately, I am not. I have listened to this CD twice all the way through, trying to give it a fair chance. I just cannot get into it, even though there are some cool riffs and hooks to be had on this record. Perhaps I am too selective in my musical tastes and have plenty of music that I would rather listen to. So after hearing a comment that Nikki Sixx made about how he thinks that Poison sucks, perhaps he should re-evaluate that statement. I could say the same about this record.

{"text": "To a previous reviewer, yes this is not the hard rock you were looking for. But, this album is coming from a different place than the \"The Heroin Diaries.\" When I first listened to the album, I was surprised too, at how different it sounded from the previous album and even \"soft\" in Nikki's standards. But giving the album a few more listens, the lyrics and the sound will creep into you. The album is a message to those who are persecuted, isolated and even attacked. Its a message for those who don't necessarily fit in and a place to find some acceptance and solitude. The track \"Skin\" is a great example of this message. It's a beautiful album because its not like a typical one, the lyrics are sometimes spoken and it feels directed.I love that this is different, and I love that this will save some kids as well. The album itself is a story, a tale for those to learn that everyone is different, and unless you're from the inside looking out, it's very difficult to understand. Take a listen, try to understand the message. This album can be enjoyed by just about anyone because of that.\n", "val": 0.01634247973561287}

{"text": "I first met Nikki Sixx in 1984 at the Rainbow in L.A. and continued to run into him at various \"hairmetal\" haunts for years afterward. He was always pleasant, somewhat quiet and had a great sense of humor and he didn't seem to take himself too seriously. I read the Heroin Diaries and felt truly bad for him; For his pain, his isolation and his loneliness while surrounded by people who either used him or were too self absorbed to care. Fast forward to 2011 and This is Gonna Hurt. I LOVE this album, it is heart pounding, thought provoking and masterfully written (as all of his songs are). However, I hated the book of the same name. I found it to be self-absorbed, preachy and condescending. I HATE that I hated it. I wanted to like it, to be insired. I wanted to root for the Rocker that is Nikki Sixx, but I can't and I don't. I find it impossible to take advice on the drudgery and mundane day to day life from a person who could fly to Prague for a weekend, when the rest of us can barely afford to go to a movie. I absolutely despise Celebrity Soap-boxing; To have to endure the \"hightened sense of well being\" of people who have more than I will ever have and who use their own sense of power to enlighten the rest of us poor slobs who need rescuing from our own miserable existance. I don't need to be rescued by someone who, in an hour can make more than I make in a year. I understand that Nikki has come to terms with who he is and where he came from, but I don't understand how he expects others to relate to him when he continually talks about photographing the obscure, derelict people of this world with a $1500 camera. In the scheme of things he is a person of means exploiting the underbelly of society and the rest of us are somewhere in the middle just waiting for a golden morsel to drop from his enriched existance. In the end, the only thing I got was that his salvation was bought and paid for. The saddest part for me was that he honestly seems to believe that he is like the rest of us and that we are all in this theatre of life together. I guess that part is true, he just has better seats.\n", "val": 0.00011377352348063141}

{"text": "\"This Is Gonna Hurt\" is the second studio release from Sixx A.M. They also have released \"The Heroin Diaries\" and a live cd titled \"Live is Beautiful\"  I absolutely LOVE \"The Heroin Diaries\" and was quite concerned that the band's second release couldn't possibly live up to the expectations that I had placed upon it. I am very happy to report that my concerns were unwarranted. \"This Is Gonna Hurt\" is the second consecutive masterpiece from Nikki Sixx, DJ Ashba and James Michael.This, like \"The Heroin Diaries\" is an incredible cd !! I simply cannot pick a favorite song, as that changes each time I listen to the cd. There are NO weak songs on this disc. First thing I noticed was that 2 of the songs, \"Help Is On The Way\" and \"Goodbye My Friends\" could easily have been on \"The Heroin Diaries\" cd. The lyrical content of those two songs lead me to believe that they may have actually initially been written for that cd. They would fit perfectly in sequence near the tail end of the first cd. \"This Is Gonna Hurt\" is a collection of powerful songs. Some powerful in the music itself, some by way of the lyrics. The cd easily could have been called \"Beauty Is Skin Deep\", as that is the underlying message throughout most of the disc. The lyrics are mostly dark and moody, yet thought provoking. It's difficult to single out a few of the songs, because I could go on all day saying something about each and every song. At this time [and the list keeps changing] my favorite songs are \"Sure Feels Right\" and \"Skin\". The songwriting is top notch, the musicianship remarkable. Unlike a Motley Crue cd, this disc [like \"The Heroin Diaries\"] utilizes horns,piano and strings, yet is a powerful disc full of hard rocking songs with great hooks. I absolutely love James Michaels' voice as once again he fits his voice to the mood of each song perfectly. As with the first release, \"This Is Gonna Hurt\" is a collection of songs that I not only love to listen to, but songs that stir something inside me and cause me to react emotionally. When \"The Heroin Diaries\" was released I immediately dubbed it my favorite cd of ALL TIME. Well, now it's tied for that Honor with \"This Is Gonna Hurt\".  I know it's extremely unfair, but I cannot wait for their next release !!In the meantime I am genuinely grateful that I now have 2 absolute musical masterpieces in my collection !!

This fantastic CD (13 great songs : both great hits & classics by the best artists & bands in the music industry, past & present including Kate Perry, P!nk, Train, Beatles, Barbara Streisand & Rod Stewart among others) presents a great performance by the talented band The Warblers.

This album of exclusive Warblers music is great- since they do not sing as much on the show, almost every song done is present on the album.  Some of the best and most memorable are: Teenage Dream, Hey Soul Sister, Bills Bills Bills, and Blackbird.

It's just unbelievable to me that there are no instruments being played as a part of these songs.  My favorite tracks on the CD are \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Raise Your Glass\".  Those two always have me singing along and really get me in a good mood as I'm driving to work in the morning.  There are also some nice ballads including \"Candle\" by Kurt and Blaine, the hot new couple on the show.  It is overall just a fun album and a \"must\" for all Gleeks (like me).\n", "val": 0.021782124415040016}
{"text": "Hottest thing ever. Can I just say, YUM?!Their vocals are absolutely gorgeous, expecially Darren Criss! I've heard him in AVPM/AVPS but didn't recognize him in Glee without the adorkable curly hair. I love every single song, but am kinda disappointed they didn't include Blaine and Rachel's (Darren Criss and Lea Michele) duet, \"Don't You Want Me\". At least it's in Volume 5. I love the classical way they cover these songs, and I'm a pretty alternative person, so I LOVELOVELOVE thier covers of \"Misery\" and \"Animal\". Maybe a cover of a Dashboard Confessional, The Maine, or Rocket to The Moon next time? (If there is a next time! D: ) I already loved those songs, and Maroon 5 and Neon Trees were already among my favorite bands. I can't believe the Warblers are leaving! They MUST stay and perform new songs! I had hoped they'd perform in the Prom Queen episode, but at least we still got BLAINE! I'm fourteen, months away from fifteen, and can I say, Darren Criss is SO my Teenage Dream.Anyway. The music is amazing, and my personal favorites are Teenage Dream, Bills, Bills, Bills, When I Get You Alone, Animal, Misery, & Somewhere Only We Know. All of them are amazing really.I particularly like the introductions to Hey Soul Sister and Animal. They transpose and kinda rewrite most of these songs, but they sound as good or even better than the originals.But I digress. BUY THIS ALBUM! IT IS AMAZING IN EVERY WAY SHAPE AND FORM!\n", "val": 0.023194707930088043}
{"text": "This album, using the simplest word, is amazing. A wonderful compilation of everything Gleeks love about the Warblers. What is most beautiful about this is the more you listen, the more you can deconstruct the complex vocal arrangements and perfect harmonies. Who thought gannan/cannon sung repetitively would sound like a ukulele? The brains behind the Warblers and the entire Glee cast have done something that is rare to find, and that is take an amazing original song and transpose it into an equally, if not better, piece of art. The song is the canvas, and the Beelzebub's voices are the paint brushes. Wonderfully put together, amazing background and lead vocals. Easily a 10 out of 10.\n", "val": 0.051276639103889465}

Instead of listening to different renditions of songs the same ways the the Glee Cast does it frequently, you get exposed to the beauty of acapella.

{"text": "When Glee originally started, I have to admit that I expected a lot more vocalistic music than what ultimately began appearing on the soundtrack CD's. While I have found each of the discs to be enjoyable, they've often had their share of Karaoke Plus type of moments, and rarely outdid the original versions of the songs they started off covering. \"Glee Presents The Warblers\" changes that.For starters, they enlist an actual Glee Club (the Tufts' University Beelzebubs) to perform the bulk of the vocal work. Then they give the lead focus to Darren Criss (Blaine on the show), one lead to Chris Colfer (Kurt) and a pair of duets for the two. It centers the album more than the other soundtracks, essentially making this Criss' debut album. Criss has a pleasant, boy-band type of voice, while Colfer sounds like the show-tunes worshiping kid he plays on the show when it's time for him to hit The Beatles' \"Blackbird.\" (He's good on the Lennon-McCartney numbers; Colfer's version of \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" remains a series standout).The selection is a solid representation of any typical \"Now That's What I Call Music\" CD, with current pop holding court. I was already partial to The Warblers' version of Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream,\" then they chart similar courses on Beyonce's \"Bills Bills Bills\" and Maroon 5's \"Misery.\" They redeem the long reviled McCartney \"Silly Love Songs\" and manage to make Barbra Streisand's \"What Kind Of Fool\" into the kind of song the Bee Gees might have done if Barry Gibb had kept the song for himself. (However, I doubt anyone will every be able to sing \"Do You Think I'm Sexy\" and make it anything better than a piffle.)The constancy of \"Glee Presents The Warblers\" make it the best of The Glee series. It also may be the first starmaker of the series, propelling Darren Criss into a promising solo career. Now where's Colfer's solo?\n", "val": 0.01962975226342678}

{"text": "Most of us Darren Criss fans will tell you that we loved his voice LONG before he landed a career making role on Glee, thanks to his spectacular performances in A Very Potter Musical and A Very Potter Sequel. (Seriously, look these up on YouTube if you love Darren Criss.) So honestly, those of us who were fans of Darren Criss previous to Glee aren't surprised that he landed the role at all. He's one of the people at the forefront of a new generation of singer/songwriters, and he's got the goods to go ALL the way. Glee can only further those dreams of his. And of course there is much to be said for the incredible Tufts Beelzebubs, who are the voices of the harmonies behind The Warblers. (Yeah, they're a real group.) All of that comes together to make a spectacular album that is worthy of the name Glee. So without further ado, here's my humble opinions on the songs of Glee: The Music Presents, The Warblers. (AKA Blaine and the Pips LOL)1). A - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - Teenage Dream - This was Glee's biggest selling digital single to date, and it's easy to see why. Combine a Katy Perry hit with the magic that is Darren Criss, and this is the end result. Pure pop bliss.2). A- - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - Hey, Soul Sister - Another infectious pop beat. I don't much care for the original version of this song, but they manage to turn it into a toe tapping beat melded with what almost sounds like a ballad.3). B - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - Bills, Bills, Bills - I never cared for this song, and even The Warblers' perfect harmonies don't really salvage it for me. They sound great, it's just not a song I like, or the beat for that matter.4). A - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - Silly Love Songs - This may be the best song on the entire album, or at least one of them. As Darren Criss said in an interview, \"It's Paul freakin' McCartney!\" Warbler perfection.5). A - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - When I Get You Alone - Another of the best songs on the album. As good as the vocals are, The Warblers' performing this on the show was amazing. A really great song.6). A- - Darren Criss (Blaine) and Chris Colfer (Kurt) with The Dalton Academy Warblers - Animal - I never cared for this song before, but The Warblers' version is AWESOME. Makes you want to jump up and down and dance. Great song.7). A- - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - Misery - At this point the realization sets in that whether I previously disliked a song or not, The Warbler version was going to be in a completely different league. Amazing.8). B - Chris Colfer (Kurt) - Blackbird - While the lyrics of this song are great, I don't care much for the arrangement at all. Chris Colfer sounds good, like always, but it's probably my least favorite song of his.9). A- - Darren Criss (Blaine) and Chris Colfer (Kurt) with The Dalton Academy Warblers - Candles - One of the most powerful and haunting duets between Darren and Criss. Beautiful song across the board.10). A- - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - Raise Your Glass - Pink's version was awesomeness personified, and it's hard to top. The Warblers actually don't manage to top it, but they still do a damn good job.11). A - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - Somewhere Only We Know - As far as show performances go, this might be The Warblers' best. As for songs, it's absolutely either one of the best, or THE best, songs on the album.12). A - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - What Kind Of Fool - An incredible ballad, which seems to be this group's strong point.13). A- - Darren Criss (Blaine) and The Dalton Academy Warblers - Do Ya Think I'm Sexy? - I have absolutely hated this song for most of my life. LOL But these guys knock this one out of the park. Great uptempo number.  Okay, so that's my two cents on Glee: The Music Presents, The Warblers. Overall, the grade is a solid A. It's very rare to have an album that is nearly all hits and no misses. No song on the album ever slips below a B, and that's saying something. The Tufts Beelzebubs (The group that sings the harmonies for The Warblers) are a consumate group of performers, and hopefully being on Glee will have helped get their career further off the ground, because they're really good. And we Darren Criss fans, again, never had any doubt he'd make it. Glee just helps him get there faster too. If you're a fan of Glee, but want something a little more traditionally 'Glee Club', then this is the album for you. Give it a try, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Thanks for your time folks.  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell\n", "val": 0.005758310668170452}

{"text": "I bought this CD and had a couple of their songs on my Ipod, previously Teenage Dream(The best selling song of any of the Glee songs from the show) and Baby, It's Cold Outside, from the Glee Christmas CD. I love the show and most of their music.  This CD is great. I read other reviews but no one mentioned Somewhere Only We Know, which I've played over and over again. I think it's the best one on the CD.  It's a beautifully done song and a cover of Keane's original) I had never heard of that group or the song. The vocals are great on the song. I always enjoyed hearing Chris' voice. He has a high voice and it's also one of the best singers on the show in my opinion.  He sings Blackbird and duets with Darren(Blaine) on Animal. I'm a big fan of the Beatles and grew up in the sixties and seventies, but I don't really remember that song that well. Chris(Kurt)does a great job on the song. All the songs are great and are covers of other singers. Bills, Bills, Bills, originally a Destiny's Child song, is very addictive along wtih Robin Thicke's When I Get You Alone.  Now that Chris' character, Kurt, has left the Warblers, I wonder how they will keep the Warblers alive. Maybe, they will give them a spinoff. Though I like the groups' renditions of Misery and What Kind of Fool, I prefer the originals by Maroon 5 and Barbra Streisand. They're not bad though and have their own spin on the songs.I'm repeating what others have said about this CD, but it bears repeating, nice arrangements, fine vocals, a fantastic CD. So,buy it.\n", "val": 0.03280191868543625}

{"text": "I'm a big Glee follower, not just of the show itself but of its music releases. While we love very much the main cast and their talent, its always refreshing to hear tracks voiced by rival Glee clubs. The Warblers side-story seemed questionable at first, even though their intentions with it were good and clear, but they easily turned out to be one of the better additions to Glee's second season thanks to their charm and style.An all-male acapella group kind of ensures that all the covers they will sing with definitely have a signature, unique sound to them. And lets face it, thats what Glee should be all about. Glee has often been critized for releasing singles that are no more than glorified karaoke versions of the originals, and sometimes I must agree with this. \"Glee The Music presents The Warblers\" features a total of 13 tracks voiced by Darren Criss, Chris Colfer and the Beelzebubs. Everything is done vocally except for about 2 tracks where actual instruments are used, most of the record is full acapella staying true to what this choir represents in the show.And the covers are pretty good too. It takes some man jewels to do a mainstream cover of songs like \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Teenage Dream\" which mostly celebrate womanhood, and other hits such as \"Hey, Soul Sister\", \"Misery\" and \"Raise Your Glass\" are catchy as hell.This cd has considerably less tracks than a typical Glee release but the ones that are here are great enough to stand on their own and make you feel happy of your listen/purchase. For gleeks, recommended. For everyone else, well it depends on how open you are with the idea of a cover cd from an acapella group.\n", "val": 0.01773129776120186}

{"text": "This review's gonna be easy because I am totally addicted to this cd and this band. Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley have a chemistry that works and I gotta say, damn it works good! You might travel all over the country to find music this good, but the only place you're gonna find unique, hard rockin', frank, straight-forward music like this is Florida Georgia Line. These guys can crank the party up to 15 on a level of 1-10 and even if the cops are called to shut it down, the cops are gonna be tippin' back the cold ones and dancin' as they do. Florida Georgia Line \"knows how to party, get a little naughty\" and they can keep the beer flowin' and the speakers blowin'. This cd is a party waiting to happen and if you're a real honest to God country rocker, it's also probably a night in jail waiting on your bail to post because you cracked someone over the head with your beer bottle.This cd is everything that country party music should be: twang, lyrics that talk of daddy's ass whoopins, cut off sleeves, tattoos, moonshine and the South, thumping bass and guitar so loud it'll make your ears bleed. When you think country, you might think of mama's down home cookin and this cd is just like that, all meat and potatoes, none of that filler stuff that you find in other \"dishes\".  This music sticks to your bones and leaves you wanting to lick the spoon.The cd starts the party with \"You're Country\" which is an anthem dedicated to all the memories of growing up in the country, being born and raised in the South and the pride that comes with it. Being from the deep South myself, I can truly appreciate this one. The beat and tempo of this one makes me wanna sling my hair and possibly injure my neck because I can't stop moving my head! It's the ultimate country head bob song. How do you follow something like that? Well, try listening to the second track, \"Now That She's Gone\", a musical \"see ya\" to the girl who holds a man back from being the country boy he was born to be, not letting him fish, come home late or eat and drink what he wants. Thanks for kicking that chick to the curb, it resulted in a great song. Ladies, let your man be who he's gonna be or you'll find yourself the subject of a song on their next cd! Another awesome song, and probably one of their most requested is \"Black Tears\". This song is dark, taking their music down a notch on the volume level to sad and lonely with the visual imagery of the story we've all heard and unfortunately is all too true, the woman who has no choice but to result to \"alternate forms of employment\" to keep herself afloat and get by in life. You can almost imagine the sad expression on her face at the end of her \"shift\", as she sits alone crying her tears, her mascara leaving  black trails down her cheeks as she hates what she has to do. What a genius song and what a fantastic way it's written instrumentally, not just lyrically. My personal favorite on the cd is \"Backwoods Beauty Queen\". This one always makes me roll the windows down so others around me can share in my tone deaf singing and watch me show why white girls shouldn't dance. \"Make a little love on a truck hood\" ... well, ok! How can you say no to that? Only if it's to the music of Florida Georgia Line though. This cd makes love to a country music lover's ears and will leave you wanting a smoke or two afterwards even if you're a non-smoker.If you get a chance to catch Tyler and Brian in your area, DO IT. I don't care if you have to catch ten buses and a taxi to get there, don't miss their live show. It's great!Just as a side note, Florida Georgia Line has a side project with Chase Rice and Jesse Rice called \"The Pirate Sessions\", a \"Buffett-Chesneyesque\" sound with a lot more country to it. Check it out when you're buying \"Anything Like Me\". Get double the trouble and double the great music!

{"text": "every CD of Nicole C. Mullen that I've gotten has created a heart of worship and praise in me that surpasses the previous CD.  I always think \"this is her best; she has reached her peak\", and yet here again, NCM has reached a new height in lifting up the name of Jesus and inspiring my heart to levels of praise and worship of my Savior.  I listened to this CD over and over all day today.  The lyrics remind me who God is, what Jesus has done for me, and that I owe my life to Him.  The songs encourage and edify and I believe anyone who struggles or is in need of spiritual renewal will be led to that place by listening to this CD.  I was \"captivated\" by the very first song - \"Holy Captivated\", and each successive song just led me deeper and deeper.  I love the tribute to Andrae Crouch and the way she mixed his \"My Tribute\" with her \"Redeemer.\"  The extended versions of Holy Captivated, I Can Do, and I Need You at the end of the CD just prolong the praise and are a welcome addition.I can't say enough about how NCM has once again allowed the Spirit of God to guide her to musical levels that will bless others as the words and music (and her sweet singing voice) also bless God.\n", "val": 0.03274014592170715}
{"text": "I received this CD as a Mother's Day gift, and my whole family is greatly enjoying this set of beautiful and worshipful songs! Nicole Mullen has a gorgeous voice and great musical talent. The song \"Kingdom Come\" is a total masterpiece. Some of my other favorites include \"Forgive Me\" and \"I Need You.\" Miraculously, the CD has earned the respect of my teen-aged kids who are very, very critical about music but admit that they like this CD. I have especially loved playing \"Kingdom Come\" and \"Forgive Me\" in the car as I take my teenagers to school in the morning because I can see that they are really listening, and it gives them the right perspective of heart and mind to start the day... enhancing their relationship with God. Thank you, Nicole!\n", "val": 0.049843888729810715}
{"text": "Prime Cuts:  I Need You (As the Deer), Forgive Me, A Song for YouWhat makes a good worship album?  First, a worship album needs to evoke the majesty and beauty of Christ in such an affecting way that one cannot help but be captivated to want to be changed by such sheer holiness.  Second, a worship disc needs to have a bracing singsong lilt in the melodic structures so that it can draw the listener and/or congregation into the worshipful atmosphere with ease and relish.  Such qualities thankful are hallmarks of Mullen's first ever worship album \"Captivated.\"  Though Mullen has been a seven time Dove Award winner and a twice Grammy Nominee, this is still her first album with songs directed primarily to the Almighty. Honestly, this is also her best album to date.  Relative to previous efforts, this finds her in a more chameleonic mode where she shuffles between various styles (funk, balladry, pop, and even reggae) making the whole worship experience more iridescent. Responsible for such a change is the employment of Ed Cash (Kari Jobe, Matthew West and Chris Tomblin) as the producer of this project.  Cash certainly brings in an air of refreshment to the songs inhabiting each with individual identity and vim.The best among the bunch are the ones where Mullen takes a dive for the heart.  The baleful ballad \"Forgive Me\" finds Mullen in confessional mode before Christ that is just pricelessly beautiful.  Also, giving the timeless Psalm 42 a new spin, \"I Need You (As the Deer)\" is a newly composed worship tune by Mullen that bares all the marks for a future worship staple.  Rich in Biblical truth, supernal in its melody and performed with a heartfelt lilt, \"I Need You (As the Deer)\" is just a worship experience in itself.  Written when she was only 12, \"I'll Praise Your Holy Name\" was the first ever song composed by Mullen.  Nevertheless, it is still a delightful testimonial worship anthem that belies the youthfulness of Mullen when she penned this ballad. \"A Song for You,\" not the old Leon Russell song, is a Mullen original where she bares her soul in a love song directed to Jesus.  Listen especially to how producer Ed Cash beautifully weaves the strings and piano into the narrative of this divine love exchange.Veering off from the slower tempo is the slinky funk of \"I Can Do.\"  With touches of Luther Vandross-like soul and a call out chorus, \"I Can Do\" is a thumping Gospel stomp.  Mullen does take a surprising sidestep into reggae as she finds herself dueting with Papa Son on \"My Shepherd.\"  While the title cut \"Captivated\" is a mid-tempo slice of pop with an irresistible hook that makes you want to sing along in no time.  Lead single \"Kingdom Come\" takes on the issue of floods, famines and earthly disasters head-on as Mullen echoes our earth's cry for God to return.  Congregations would serve God's truth a great service if this worship anthem were to make it to the worship times of churches.\"Captivated\" indeed is aptly titled.  This is truly a record that captures the beauty of God grounded in Scriptural truth and performed with dint of sheer honesty and heartfelt love towards Jesus.  Furthermore, the strong melodies and the variety of styles make the worship experience even more alluring and attractive.  \"Captivated\" indeed has captured the heart of worship.\n", "val": 0.02263069525361061}

{"text": "From the moment her CD started playing on my computer, I was \"captivated\" by the music, voice and the message of Nicole Mullen on her CD, Captivated. The first song on her CD appropriately titled, \"Holy Captivated,\" wholly captivated my attention and caused me to immediately lift my heart to the Lord in worship, praise and adoration of him and his Holy name. The beauty of her rich and powerful voice in the song Holy Captivated accompanied by a very unique melody line delivers up a delightful rendition of praise to our God that is sure to please the most discriminating Christian Music audiophile.\"I Can Do\" is an enjoyably spirited song with a memorable melody and rhythm that will make you want to get up out of your seat and lift your hands and heart up to the Lord in praise celebrating the fact that indeed we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us. \"I Need You\" (As The Deer) is a sweetly melodic and rhythmically appealing song encouraging our hearts to realize that we need the Lord and to diligently seek him.The next song on her CD is \"Kingdom Come\" which is followed by \"My Shepherd,\" an upbeat reggae styled song that reminds us that because the Lord is our Shepherd we shall not want or lack or do without any good thing. Nicole's rhapsodic vocal on this song perfectly suits her vocal range and shows off the true dimensions of her vocal talent. I think of the line that I've heard from the panel of judges on American Idol when they have told some contestant that they could \"sing the phone book\" and it would sound incredible. That's just how incredibly good Nicole Mullen is when it comes to singing any of the songs on her CD regardless of the style or genre.\"Forgive Me\" is a heart touching song of a penitent sinner seeking forgiveness for sin from the Lord. And Nicole delivers the song in such a moving way that we as the listener find ourselves examining our hearts and singing along with her confessing our sin to our Savior. Next on the CD is her song \"Lead Me\" and then follows a stirring rendition of the songs My Tribute/Redeemer. After that she sings \"A Song For You\" and then the first song she wrote when she was just 12 titled \"I'll Praise Your Holy Name\" which is a thoroughly enjoyable song of praise and adoration to the Lord. The three remaining songs on the CD are extended versions of \"Holy Captivated,\" \"I Can Do,\" and \"I Need you.\"I had not heard of Nicole Mullen before I had the privilege and joy of listening to her \"Captivated\" CD. And I am glad that I had a chance to listen to it and look forward to hearing much more from the talented, spirited and spiritually devoted artist in the future.I received a complimentary copy of The CD Captivated by Nicole C Mullen from Maranatha Music for reviewing it.\n", "val": 0.050652068108320236}

The songs contain Colt's \"Hip-Hop/Rap/Alternative Southern Rock\", along with guest artists, singing along on the songs, \"PURE COUNTRY STYLE\". Plus, you get a whole host of backing musicians, playing all kinds of instruments, including fiddles, guitars, drums, etc. This great release features: Eric Church, Luke Bryan, Tim McGraw, Craig Morgan, and the \"Legendary Country/Southern Rocker\" - Charlie Daniels, plus several more guest singers.Even though Colt's style is different from traditional country music, one thing that does remain constant, is that all his songs, contain \"solid country themes\".I recently saw Colt Ford and his massive band perform live at the Northeast Louisiana Delta Music Festival, and they were awesome. I bought a picture of Colt Ford, where he is wearing a Rebel Flag patch, plus an Allman Brothers Band, Peach Logo patch. Colt is from Athens, Georgia.If you like Colt Ford and his unique country music style, then you'll love this one.As for me, I love traditional Country, Southern Rock, and Colt's \"New\", Country Style. I l consider him to be an innovator. He says he raps, because he can't sing.Anyway, thanks, and I hope this review has been helpful.\n", "val": 0.022523125633597374}

Her voice conveys warmth, joy and empathy on these tracks. \"Hard Bargain\" is about having the strength to move on in life despite feeling weary. I like the banjo playing on this song. \"New Orleans\" is an up tempo song about the resilience of the city of New Orleans.  \"Big Black Dog\" is an enjoyable song about finding homes for homeless dogs. \"Nobody\" is a song about feeling comfortable about being single. This song is also about having hope that love is right around the corner.  \"My Name is Emmett Till\" is a song about a black teenager who was killed in 1955 for talking to a white woman.  Emmylou is a great story teller.  This song proves it.  Emmett Till death started the civil rights movement and the call for peace.  Emmylou conveys this in the song.  Her vocals are very moving on this song.  \"The Road\" is a song about Emmylou's singing partner Gram Parsons who died in 1973.  This tune is about the special relationship they had with each other.  \"Ship on His Arm\" is the best love song on this album. This song is very pretty.  It is the first song that contains a reference to a tattoo in it. \"Six White Cadillacs\" is a song that puts me in a good mood. I love the spirited tone of this song. \"Darlin' Kate\" is a beautiful song about saying farewell to a loved one. The musical arrangements of this song are so beautiful. \"Goodnight Old World\" is a song that gives me a sense of peace. \"Home Sweet Home\" is a song that makes me appreciate my home. Emmylou caresses every note on this song perfectly.  This song is very pleasant. \"Cross Yourself\" has a spiritual tone that I really like. \"Lonely Girl\" is a lovely tune.

It is fortunate that lyrics were included because at times her words are inaudible in the wash of studio noise.  Even on tracks where the vocal is mixed up, such as Lonely Girl, the voice sounds as if it were electronically altered.  As most of the songs are written by Ms. Harris, it is a shame that they are presented in such a poor production as this.  There are some really powerful pieces here, especially the folk homages to Emmitt Till and the New Orleans storm.  Hopefully next time a producer is found that will allow Ms. Harris' voice to soar again.

I wouldn't rank \"Hard Bargain\" among my five favorite albums by Emmylou (she has so many great ones, that it's hard to crack the top tier), but nevertheless there is a lot to enjoy on here. These are well-crafted songs with atmosphere and passion, lyrics that are reflective and meditative. All in all, a very stirring, evocative collection of songs. I would think that any listener who has enjoyed other recent albums by Emmylou will be impressed by this one too.\n", "val": 0.020761137828230858}

{"text": "Emmylou wrote most of the lyrics for the songs on this album;and she wrote them from her heart and soul. She tells us through these songs that her hife has been a \"hard bargain\".Yes,she has had her trials and tribulations,but by baring her thoughts and soul in these songs;she is not asking for sympathy. I have been a fan of her and her music for over 25 years,and have always felt that her music was ,above all else,true to herself. This has never been more evident than in these songs. I really enjoyed many of the Reviews here,some I did not agree with,but everyone is entitled to their opinion. A lot of the reviews were less than enthused with the music,and felt that it drowned out Emmylou's,magnificent and distinctive voice. With that I agree,but be that as it may,I still feel her excellent voice more than offsets that. I reacall an interview with Emmylou where she said she wished they would get their music out of the studios and back in the living rooms where it came from and belongs. I wish she had done that here,as it would have enhanced her songs. The songs are very sad and lonely and straight from the soul and experiences Emmylou has had with the people who meant so much in her life. For that reason,it is unlikely that many of these songs will be recorded by other artists. It wouldn't make sense because there is no denying ;these are her songs,and would lack believeability if sung by others. My only hope is that Emmylou's life has had her share of rewards and happiness along with the sadness and loneliness conveyed in this album--God knows she deserves it. By the way,the CD comes with a booklet with all the lyrics to all the songs--you'll need it because the music drowns out many of Emmylou's words.\n", "val": 0.00010039548942586407}

Emmylou doesn't position herself as a pop singer. But these arrangements are generic, undistinguished pop, with particularly robotic and unimaginative drumming.In live concert, Emmylou comes alive, sounding animated and dynamic. But every time she goes into the studio, her voice acquires a kind of wistful, monotonous whine. No matter what the quality of the material, most of the tracks end up sounding pretty much the same.What's with the lack of sample tracks?

Emmylou tackles the death of Emmett Till, a martyr for the cause of civil rights in a fitting musical elegy.

The reason I'm not sure is the obtrusive noise that producer Jay Joyce chose to back the song with.  It becomes increasingly louder as the song goes on as if meant to compete with Emmylou instead of enhancing.  It is distacting and ruins what otherwise would have been a great track.I found this to be an issue throughout.  Emmylou wrote some great, insightful and heartfelt lyrics for this album, and her voice continues to be magnificent.  However, time and again that background raises in volume level taking away from the beauty of the poetry and the poet.In an ideal world, Emmylou's recordings would be on a back porch somewhere.  Maybe two accoustic guitars and a bass fiddle as back-up.  Nothing more is ever needed.  In lieu of that, she should at least stick to real people playing real instruments as accompaniment.  As for Jay Joyce; you had before you one of the most beautiful voices ever to grace this planet.  Just because you sit at a board with dials and sliders that make all sorts of noises does not mean you should.  This is a classic case of less would have been more.Ultimately, it is Emmylou Harris's name on the finished product.  Maybe she felt a need to dabble in the overproduced schlock that passes for music these days.

'Emmett Till' and 'Darlin Kate' may be well-intentioned and personal but boy do they drag. 'Big Black Dog' is embarrassing, whatever Emmylou's involvement with canine welfare. She is wonderful, we all love her. I'm afraid this album doesn't make it for meI refer you to the Amazon UK review which I  think is spot on:After a 40-year career which has generated over 25 albums, countless collaborations, twelve Grammy wins, membership of the Country Music Hall of Fame and the undying gratitude of several figures in country music, it's only fair that Emmylou Harris has earned the right to a bit of self-indulgence.Alas, though, often self-indulgence doesn't work. Harris' genius has always been to take a song and own it, to make it her own. Whether it were an old Louvin Brothers number everyone had forgotten, or a completely new take on a Patsy Cline classic, her voice would transform it.The trouble with Harris is that she's never been much of a songwriter. Actually, that's not correct, quite: there was one instance where her self-penned work was wonderful. Boulder to Birmingham, written shortly after the death of her collaborator, duettist and friend, Gram Parsons, was a highlight of 1975's Pieces of the Sky album. This set begins with another tribute to Gram, The Road; but where the former was full of imagery and allusion, this one makes its point in the most prosaic of ways. All but two of these songs are self-written, but the only one that resonates is Darlin' Kate, written for her close friend, the late Kate McGarrigle. Here it feels as though she forgets what she is trying to do and just writes from her heart.\n", "val": 0.0058260513469576836}

I can only compare her voice to a bottle of wine which has been left in the cellar while it matures. Her voice seems to improve each time I hear her sing and this must be partly due to the care she takes in her singing,Nothing has to be oversung or shouted out.Whereas many singers voices wane away with time Emmylou just seems to get better and betterI like the way in which she devotes many ov=f these songs to those who have meant alot to her through her lifeLeave that bottle of wine to mature for longer and longerS ,From a simple fanThanks Emmylou-I shall enjoy this Gem of an album again and again-and againNick Wadham\n", "val": 0.010504945181310177}
{"text": "Emmylou Harris has not released a full studio album since 2008. It hasn't been a long wait, but it's had a big payoff. It would have been hard to top her last effort, All I Intended to Be, but she hasn't quite done that yet.Hard Bargain starts out with one of the most epic opening songs in recent memory. \"The Road\" is a booming tribute to Gram Parsons and the mark he made on her life and music in his short but influential life and career. It's a touching story song with an instrumental and vocal performance guaranteed to take your breath away.\"The Road\" is a fitting start to an album that will take your breath away. It has all the classic elements of an Emmylou Harris album: love, loss, acceptance, and a touching love of dogs. The songs are honest and emotional. They tell stories that everyone knows, in a way only Harris could tell them. But her musical influences are more obviously diverse on Hard Bargain, taking elements from various points of her later career.A startling rockier side to Harris is shown in songs like \"Six White Cadillacs\" and especially on \"New Orleans.\" Her voice is melted into a background of pounding drums and electric guitar. Songs like \"Home Sweet Home\" and \"Hard Bargain\" are are more optimistic and poppy. They have more subdued instrumentals.Among Harris' quieter ballads are \"Nobody,\" \"The Ship on his Arm,\" \"My Name is Emmett Till,\" and \"Darlin' Kate\" (one being the tribute to a boy murdered in Mississippi and the last being a tribute to Canadian folk singer and friend Kate McGarrigle). All of them are powerfully delivered, but they fall unfortunately short.\"Big Black Dog\" is one of the bouncier sounding songs on the album and it has the sweetest and simplest story to tell. It is just what it claims to be: a song about a big black dog that Harris rescued.Although Harris has always sung very personal songs, Hard Bargain focuses more on her insecurities on feeling alone and on growing older in songs like \"Nobody\" and \"Lonely Girl.\" It's nice to see this tender side of Harris, but neither song is particularly memorable.Hard Bargain is full of old comforts and unexpected new developments in Harris' career. It has something for many of her fans and shifts effortlessly from one sound and mood to the next. But there are too many moments on it that fall short of the kind of masterpieces Harris has made in the past.\n", "val": 0.006408406421542168}
{"text": "Emmylou Harris has many admirers, but my wife and I may be the only ones who chose our wedding date based on her tour schedule. It wasn't that we were following her around like a couple of Deadheads --- we wanted Buddy Miller, then her lead guitarist, and his wife Julie to give a mini-concert for the guests at our wedding.We spent just enough time with the Millers that weekend to grill them about Emmylou. They had no dish --- really, they had almost nothing to say about her. And they explained why: Emmylou Harris is an unspeakably nice person.Her twitches are minor: baseball, her dogs, and if there's a third one, I've forgotten it. After three marriages, she lives in Nashville with her mother and brother. She has a shelter for rescued dogs in her yard.Her career reads equally saintly. Over 40 years and 25 records and a dozen Grammys, she's followed her instincts, and, in the process, avoided sudden spikes and tumbles. She has graced hundreds of records as a celestial back-up singer and duet partner. The verdict is generous: There are, a critic has said, no bad Emmylou Harris records --- only good ones and better ones.\"Hard Bargain\" is one of the better ones. Recorded in just a month with only three musicians, its first distinction is that Emmylou wrote 11 of the 13 songs. This is unusual --- it's only the third release on which she's been the dominant writer. The second distinction is that she's 64 now, and, like a lot of people who have hit their sixties, she can't quite grasp where the time went. And why people who have been important to her --- Gram Parsons and Kate McGarrigle, most prominently --- can be located only in memory.This is a CD of deep feeling: sad memory, deep loss, specific regret. But it's not self-indulgent or maudlin --- if anything, the music is unusually jaunty. Very much like the new Paul Simon CD. And like Simon, she's reached a place where she can see far and she can see wide --- without trading sharp observation or wry insight for boomer platitude.It's tricky to interview an icon. Fame at that level is a shield; you can't get in, she can't get out. It's tough enough with actors. It's much tougher with an Emmylou Harris, because everything about her --- that crystalline voice, that forever gray hair --- suggests that she's some kind of living saint. When we chatted on the phone, that seemed like a good place to start.Jesse Kornbluth: I've been listening to you --- and reading about you --- for decades, and it occurred to me: I know nothing about you that you don't want me to know. How have you achieved that? A flawless life? Or total discretion?Emmylou Harris: A flawless life, absolutely. The only time I ever appeared in the Enquirer was for a piece about people who let their hair grow gray. I guess I'm not much of a wild child.JK: Buddy Miller says that he feels what he plays is \"country\" and that stuff they play on the radio is \"alternative.\" Given that he was your guitarist, on and off, for a decade, it's no stretch to say that applies equally to you. Where are you with country music and/or Nashville?EH: I'm nowhere with country music. I don't hear much of it, so I shouldn't venture an opinion, but when it finds me, it seems formulaic. I don't hear anyone who moves me like George Jones or Bill Monroe. The country that you hear on the radio, it feels poppy but without the originality of pop.JK: Do you miss your country years?EH: I had my run. It served me well. Country taught me how to sing, it put me on a path. But I was never going to be locked into a formula. I don't want to be considered a current country artist.JK: Still, you live in Nashville. Go out much?EH: I'm going out tonight to present an award to Kris Kristofferson and see a free movie.JK: What about tomorrow night?EH: Normally I don't go out. I run a dog rescue shelter.JK: Topic change: your new CD. On which you do your own backup vocals. Is this a first?EH: No, but I've never sung backup on all the songs before.JK: Musically, is it more of a challenge?EH: As an experience, it's easier to harmonize with yourself than with others. But I still judge it by the same standards --- if I didn't sound good or we needed a different color, we'd bring someone in.JK: You've spoken of going from gig to gig on your bus: \"I'm like a trench soldier, I've been out there on the bus.\" After all these years, do you ever look at rock stars and think, \"I'd kill for their plane?\"EH: I love the bus! You can spread out. You have your books. You can sleep when you want, have company when you feel like it. And you can take your dogs. I wish I'd realized that earlier --- it's only in the last 15 years that I've taken them with me on the bus. They're such a joy --- they keep you in the present.JK: When I think of you, I think of Virgil's line: \"Admire a large vineyard, cultivate a small one.\" By which I mean: You've always been hungry for the music --- not the fame.EH: You must have somebody listening. I have just enough people paying attention that I have the freedom to be in charge. And I have a great record company --- Nonesuch understands what I'm about.JK: Paul Simon, who's 69, says, \"When I'm in the music, I'm no age.\" And as a performer, you too have achieved around 40 years of visible past. No surprise that your new CD is drenched in time --- time as a force, almost a character. How heavy does that feel?EH: Paul's right --- time is light when I'm making music. Other times it ranges from heavy to inconsequential. But the press of time? It's always there. And it's sometimes a wonder --- I can't believe that I'm at this age and still working and have all these things I want to do. In that, I'm lucky. I'm healthy and in better shape than I was 30 years ago.JK: Energy, creative spark, opportunity --- so why name the CD \"Hard Bargain?\"EH: Just being in the world is a hard bargain. Everything has a price, a blessing and a curse. It's relentless. We can't really resist life --- we're pulled back into it.JK: What's the reward?EH: The reward is that we're here.\n", "val": 0.008721929974853992}
{"text": "In recent years the trilogy of records produced by a completely rejuvenated Emmylou Harris, which starts with the wonders of \"Wrecking Ball,\" climaxes with the brilliant \"Red Dirt Girl\", and gently lands with the lovely \"Stumble into grace\" amounted to a peak in Americana music. Harris could barely put a foot wrong and the awards flowed like wine. There have since been a couple of missteps on the way since this reviewer is not a huge fan of her collaboration with Mark Knoplfer yet particularly enjoyed the fine covers on \"All I intended to be\" (although not all the originals).Many have questioned whether Emmylou Harris is an artist who sings other people's songs better than she writes her own? In a recent interview with NPR she admitted that songwriting doesn't come easy for her: \"It's the fear of writing that's still there with me,\" Consequently with the majority of tracks on \"Hard Bargain\" self penned does Harris conquer her fear. The answer is yes in most cases but with a couple of songs that absolutely stand out. Her heartbreaking requiem for her dear departed friend the great folk singer Kate Anna McGarrigle is one example and possibly one of the finest tunes she has written. When \"she sings that you are sailing now/ free from the pain\" it would take a very cold heart not to be deeply moved by its sentiment. Another even closer friend Gram Parsons is again the key subject of the opener \"The Road\". She has been here before of course not least in \"Boulder to Birmingham\" her poignant ode capturing the depth of her shock and pain at losing Parsons. While \"The Road\" is perhaps not in that class, her unique breathy vocals combined with a rock steady beat is a joy and the song's bridge takes it to new levels.Other noteworthy songs include the shuffling earthy blues of \"Six white Cadillac's\", the atmospheric country of \"Lonely girl\", the rocky \"New Orleans\" and the excellent cover of Ron Sexmith's \"Hard Bargain\". That said the straightforward country homage to a \"Big black dog\" has a novelty value but little else and while the waltz like \"Goodnight old world\" is fine it does drag. On the basis of concluding with a strong finish the final two tracks \"Nobody\" and \"Cross Yourself\" are excellent. They echo a Daniel Lanois style production except that album producer Jay Joyce writes \"Cross Yourself\" and his pop-related song is a splendid ending. One gripe is quite why her cover of the Low Anthem's alt country classic \"To Ohio\" sung together with the bands maestro Ben Knox Miller is confined to the deluxe album. This is a outright mystery since it is the best duet that Harris has done since her seminal vocal on Ryan Adams glorious \"My Sweet Carolina\" and you must promise to seek this out.Throughout the musicianship is \"best in class\" and \"Hard Bargain\" represents a fine collection of songs. In the last analysis its probably not as good as either \"Wrecking ball\" or \"Red Dirt Girl' but frankly there aren't many albums that could come within a hundred miles of their brilliance. Thus \"Hard Bargain\" is another fine contribution from Emmylou Harris a singer we should cherish and give thanks that unlike many of her contemporaries she remains a constant source of deeply moving music.\n", "val": 0.0202637929469347}

Touches of some of Emmylou's past with the likes of Daniel Lanois and Malcom Burns spring to mind but this is so personal, intimate filled with such tender breathless gems.

{"text": "This is a great CD release by the 12 times Grammy Award winner Emmylou Harris, titled 'Hard Bargain'. The legendary Emmylou Harris continues very smoothly & successfully where she left off from the great 2006 collaboration with legendary former Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler in 'All The Roadrunning' & her well acclaimed 2008 CD release 'All I Intended To Be'. The MP3 download has 14 great tracks plus a digital booklet (instead of usual 11 tracks on CD). The opening track \"The Road\" is a great opener : great country-rock sound with great vocals. This song is rather very personal one as she sings about the late rocker Gram Parsons. Who died in 1973 at the age of 26 & she sings \"I can still remember every song you played\". Other great tracks include \"Home Sweet Home\" (great country music sound with great vocals), \"Goodnight Old World\" (a slow track with Spanish guitar/banjo base track with great clear vocals), \"New Orleans\" (up-tempo track with great high-pitched vocals), \"Big Black Dog\" (a rather 'playful' track with a 'staccato sound' but great bass/guitar/keyboard combination), \"Lonely Girl\" (a slow track, great high pitched vocals & great melody), \"Six White Cadillacs\" (great bass/rhythm guitar combination), \"The Ship On His Arm\" (a slow track, great guitar sound & harmonies), \"Darlin' Kate\" (another slow track, great acoustic string pickings with great clear vocals. This song is another personal/emotional track about her friend/fellow singer Kate McGarrigle who passed away in January 2010 of cancer at home in Montreal, Canada), \"Nobody\" (up-tempo track with great bass/rhythm guitar combination, great vocals & melody), \"Cross Yourself\" (great guitar/vocal combination & great melody) & the closing track \"To Ohio\" (a slow track with great acoustic guitar chords & great Spanish guitar/banjo sound. This track features the band The Low Anthem creating a great duo with Emmylou Harris). My favourites/stand-outs/solid tracks/gems include \"My Name Is Emmett Till\" (a slow excellent track with great acoustic guitar string pickings, wonderful clear vocals & beautiful melody) & the title track \"Hard Bargain\" (a beautiful guitar 'rich' sound with great vocals & melody). On the overall, this is a well crafted CD release by the legendary Emmylou Harris (no weak track, a well balanced CD of 'varied music sound' including slow, mid-tempo & up-tempo tracks), a highly recommended CD listening.\n", "val": 0.05922812223434448}
{"text": "Hard Bargain is Emmylou Harris' first release in almost 3 years and it was worth the wait! Her vocals are smooth as honey and hugely emotive and her voice still has that irresistible frail breathlessness. The songs are well written with meaningful lyrics and the music, as always, is beautiful and intuitive. It's hard to believe there are only 3 musicians, including Harris, making all the music. Long, weeping fiddle notes and chunky, contemplative piano chords are balanced only by the occasional tentative brightness of a banjo or mandolin. The percussion is distant, if there at all, but always clever. \"Darlin' Kate\" is about her close friend Kate McGarrigle who died last year of cancer. \"The Road\" looks back to her formative years spent with the late Gram Parsons at the start of her career. \"Big Black Dog\" is inspired by her animal shelter philanthropy and is the only almost-happy song on the album. \"My name is Emmett Till is the true story of a 14 year old black boy killed in Mississippi for talking to a white woman. Overall the strength and sincerity of Harris' songs make this just another reason to love and respect her.\n", "val": 0.029382117092609406}

{"text": "HERREWEGHE'S UPBEAT TEMPOS PLUS FOUR OUTSTANDING SOLOISTS MAKE THIS 1989 RECORDING STILL ONE OF THE BEST AVAILABLE! (A re-release at a more reasonable price.)The composition of the Christmas Oratorio by J.S.Bach((1685-1750)is estimated to be around 1734.  This is more than the usual series of six self-contained cantatas for the Christmas period as there are many unifying factors at work.  The most obvious is the Evangelist's narrative, which is based on the Gospel readings for the season; the six commemorative days are: First Day of Christmas (Luke 2: l,3-7) - Second Day of Christmas (Luke 2: 8-14) - Third Day of Christmas (Luke 2: 15-20) - New Years Feast of the Circumcision (Luke 2: 21) -Sunday after New Year (Matt. 2: 1-6) and Epiphany (Matt. 2: 7-12).  Bach's librettist (unknown) was careful to give each part its identity, meditating on various aspects of the Christmas Story.Everything about this recording is first-rate, from the Chorus and Orchestra of the Collegium Vocale to the ourstanding soloists.  Herreweghe's tempos are upbeat and he apparently encouraged a 'bright' sound in the orchestra as well as the chorus.  There are some exquisitely performed instrumental solos, particularly on violin, oboe, oboe d'amore, flute and trumpet.The four vocal soloists performed with dramatic intensity displaying familiarity within the realm of Bach.  Michael Chance, countertenor, who sang three major arias totaling twenty-one minutes, was perfection as he produced note after 'golden' note.  In Part Five there is a hauntingly beautiful trio rendered by Barbara Schlick, soprano, Michael Chance, alto, and Howard Crook, tenor.  Peter Kooy's bass solo in Part Five was beyond description in its lovliness.It was interesting that Herreweghe seemed to give this work a somewhat romantic interpretation.  This was quite evident in the individual solos beginning with Chance's first aria \"Bereite dich Zion, mit zartlichen Trieben\" (Prepare Thyself Zion).  Having several other reocrdings of this work with Chance, it is apparent that his interpretation is romanticized and this trend continues throughout the performance, showing up again in Kooy's bass aria \"Grofer Herr, O Starker Koenig\" (Great Lord, and Mighty King). I loved this approach of Herreweghe's because it's refreshing and not usually heard in this manner!It's really exciting to have so many excellent renditions of this great and glorious Oratorio, and most of them are worthy of our attention.  I have three other recordings of this work, but for me this one wins the blue ribbon.GRAMOPHONE, (12/1989):  \"As Evangelist, Howard Crook is clear and forthright, punctuating and inflecting with all the necessary skill of a good story-teller...The countertenor, Michael Chance also turns in a splendid performance; his \"Schlafe, mein Liebster\" (Part Two) is warm in tone and fervent in spirit and from a technical viewpoint, beautifully controlled...the Dutch bass Peter Kooy has a lightish voice with a pleasing edge to it...Barbara Schlick's aria 'Nur ein Wink von Semen Hhnden' (Part Six) is enchanting, and she sang it radiantly...The voices of Collegium Vocale, Ghent, are pleasingly blended and quite well-diciplined...Herreweghe's Orchestra plays extremely well and there are fine contributions, especially from oboe and horn.\"This has to be one of Bach's most melodious, magnificent and surely memorable compositions amidst a multitude of treasures. If you are a 'Bach-a-holic' as I am, you simply cannot live without this music!\n", "val": 0.01645059324800968}

You get the sensation the song is over due to that climatic bridge but then you realize there is still quite a bit more of the song left.It is a pop/rock song but it is far from the auto-tuned synthesized techno dance track you hear so much lately on the pop radio stations.

{"text": "It's been WAY too long since we've gotten a new David Cook song. It was worth waiting for!Nothing about David Cook ever disappoints, and this first single from his 6/28 to be released album, \"This Loud Morning\", is no exception. First and foremost, David's incredible vocals are front and center. He has a way of singing the words as if he's singing directly to you. I almost feel like he's saying his goodbyes to me, and in such a nice way. I can't think of another singer who touches my heart like David Cook.The only problem with this song, is that I can't stop singing it in my head. No matter how hard I try to get back to real life and concentrate, I keep hearing, \"I didn't want to lose you...this is the last goodbye.\" The beat is infectious - can't help but tap my toes. I think the term is \"earworm\", and it definitely fits this song.The lyrics are poetry. Reading them, even without the music, is a treat. My favorite phrase, \"a broken piece of art put on display\". Lyrics like this are not the typical fare on the radio today. How does he do it? He and Ryan Tedder created a pop/rock song with a great beat, that has poetry for lyrics.The music is also fantastic. His use of instruments is one of my favorite things about David Cook songs. I can't wait to see what David, and his band Neal Tiemann, Andy Skip, Monty Anderson and Kyle Peek do with this song in person. The record rocks, so imagine how it will rock out on stage.In short - The Last Goodbye is everything I expected from David Cook and more. As a singer, a musician, a songwriter, a producer, and a human being, there is no one like him. I look forward to hearing this not only on my own ipod, but on the radio for quite some time to come. I hope he has lots of room for more platinum on his wall.\n", "val": 0.01853487826883793}

She has a distinctive alternative/folksy sound that reminds me a little bit of the Decemberists more folksy songs.

So in order to circumvent this desire of mine to skip it in my mp3 player it must have several key elements to stop me from pushing that button. The first is innovative lyrics, then a soul that resonates, and a story in the sound (and I don't mean musicals). The song's lyrics are not impressive. They are somewhat repetitive and lack imagery and metaphors that make it stand out or relate to me. The soul in the song is...quiet. She has a lovely voice but because the song's lyrics lack power, her voice is underutilized and they make me think of...a calm stream in the mountains. Very lovely, but no something that will keep your interest for long unless you want to meditate. And then comes the story of the sound. This is where it gets tricky. The story of the sound only has two arcs. Most great songs have three places in the song that will keep you hooked. The climax of the song is the middle part after the introduction that will pull the song and finally cement it into your brain. The climax of this song started great but ended prematurely with more soothing tones that reminded me of the introduction of the song. I wish the best for this artist, but would suggest more variety and structure within the music.\n", "val": 9.77298041107133e-05}
{"text": "Like a folksier Miranda Lambert, Sarah Jarosz connects to the pit of me with `Run Away'; a soft yet piercing folk ballad.  With country, blue-grass roots that sink deep into her musical persona, Jarosz uses her stunning voice to create a beautiful and haunting track here.  The lyrical content isn't very original (there and plenty of songs, especially in the Country genre, that cover this brand of material) but she sells it with every word.  For those of you iffy about the association with Blue Grass, know that this is a very modern and accessible take on the genre, one that many can and will soak up with delight.  She underscores the finger plucking guitar strings with a crystal clear voice that pierces through and builds an emotional response; and the choice to slow down the commonly high-energy variants of the song make for a nice change of pace.

{"text": "----------------------------------------------------------------Laura Cantrell\"Kitty Wells Dresses: Songs Of The Queen Of Country Music\"(Diesel Only, 2011)----------------------------------------------------------------Alt-country heroine Laura Cantrell pays tribute to country music trailblazer Kitty Wells -- the first woman to top the country charts and a towering figure in the Nashville landscape throughout the 1950s and '60s.  Cantrell is herself a modern gal with a retro vibe, and she taps into old-school twang like nobody's business.  She finds a powerful muse in Kitty Wells, picking classic heartsongs and ballads, and channeling the plaintive, true-country feel that made Wells' work so compelling. This is a solid set of traditional, old-school country with strong contributions from numerous talented pickers: steel guitarist Chris Scruggs perfectly captures the Hawaiian-inflected style of the early '50s, bluegrass bassist Mike Bub thumps along in a minimalist mode while Americana neo-twangsters such as Paul Burch, Fats Kaplin and Chuck Mead chime in as well.  This is perhaps the finest album of Cantrell's career and a fitting tribute to Kitty Wells and her era -- a rock-solid set of heartfelt twang. Highly recommended!

{"text": "Robert Johnson, blues pioneer and legend, would turn 100 next month if he were still alive.  In celebration of his centennial, his all-too-brief catalog-- 29 master takes and 13 alternates-- has been reissued.As I'm sure a lot of you reading this already have these recordings in some form or another, I'm going to start by talking about the presentation of this material.  Put simply-- this set is a revelation of sound-- it's remarkable, both the 1990 collection (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Complete-Recordings/dp/B000002ADN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Complete Recordings</a>) and the later reissues of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/King-of-Delta-Blues-Singers/dp/B00000AG6X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">King of Delta Blues Singers</a>&nbsp;all have that \"pre-World War II reissue sound\".  Many of you know what I mean, scratches, pops, microphone hiss, etc.  It lends a certain charm to the music, but it can certainly change the listening experience.  This recording is remarkably free of that-- crisp, clean, clear, no artifacts of age or old media.  It's really amazing, I've never heard anything from this era that sounds like this, it has my salivating at the potential for remastering other pre-WWII music and it really brings Johnson to life-- with such clarity, both his singing and guitar playing leap off the recordings.And really, that brings me back to the recordings, a true treasure of their era, Robert Johnson was a powerfully talented man.  Generally recognized for his guitar playing (rumor has it he sold his soul to the Devil to attain such mastery), Johnson was also a singer of fierce power, channeling deep and powerful emotions and demonstrating excellent flexibility in his voice.  Accompanying himself on guitar, Johnson demonstrates remarkable technique, instantly recognizable as his own and never really replicated by anyone else.  I think it was best summed up by Keith Richards, who famously asked when hearing Johsnon, \"who is the other guy playing with him?\"The songs themselves have been covered and re-covered so many times, in many ways they're instantly familiar to us.  To hear Johnson perform though is often a revelation-- he can bring forth such emotions seemingly at will, haunted fear (\"Hellhound on My Trail\"), anxiety (\"Ramblin' On My Mind\") and ecstacy (\"They're Red Hot\").  But for me, when he's at his best is when there's almost an acceptance of a dark resolution-- \"Me and the Devil Blues\" and \"Cross Road Blues\" come immediately to mind.  It's something I've never quite heard in anyone else's music, and certainly the many, many covers of the latter are simply lacking in comparison.The bottom line is, these recordings are essential parts of music history, it's hard to overstate this, and should be investigated by virtually any serious music fan.  For those who have previous issues of these recordings, the sonic upgrade here is to my ears worth the investment.  Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.01252773404121399}

Well I firgured it would be re-remastered using todays technology and I saw it had unreleased 2 snippets on disc 2 . I was gonna purchase it thru Amazon like I do most of the time but I wanted to see the packaging first to see if it was remastered . Well I purchased it today at a local independent record store (there are so few left these days)and I gotta say ,the sound is much improved over the 1990 boxset . The booklet is very nice and informative and the 2 new snippets (even though they are only seconds in length)are historical seconds in the story of the Blues . Maybe you have to be a Delta Blues fanatic like me to appreciate these few seconds . All in all this is a great 2cd set with great sound .

{"text": "Robert Johnson is amazing. To the uninitiated, or the unschooled ear, I can understand why it takes a few listens to really appreciate his songwriting, singing and guitar playing. But to those willing to delve in deep, you'll discover the best the blues has to offer.I had the 1990 collection and this release is much better. The clarity of both the singing and the guitar work is an improvement. The sound is brighter and more detailed. However, with his attention to brightness, some of the bass has been lost and the background hiss can also be high. For me, this sacrifice is justified to be able to hear the subtleties of the chording as well as the croon of Robert's voice.At the modest price, this upgrade is worth it for sure in my opinion. Is it perfect? No. Perfection to me would be the complete removal of the hiss without damaging the tone. However, since the hiss is from the source material, this is probably as good as we will hear it unless new mastering technology or hiss removal evolves.In sum, you WILL hear some details you haven't heard on other releases. But when you crank it up in the car, the hiss can still be distracting. I suspect cutting that frequency will cut into the fidelity - otherwise it would be gone.Still, for those who are into RJ, this is the version I'd recommend. I'm happy with it, but man, I wish the recording techniques were better back in 1936! But better some static on the recording rather than having nothing to document his greatness at all.Pick it up, and wait for Scratch himself to come knocking on your door!\n", "val": 0.002938643330708146}

Surely they understand that a large part of Johnson's appeal is that he died young.  That he died violently only adds to his aura, much like the yarns about bargains with the devil.They probably also know that Johnson's contemporaries certainly didn't consider him the \"greatest blues singer\".  Charley Patton and Son House were his formidable--and some would say superior--competition.  Very few bluesmen covered Robert Johnson's blues until his renanscence about forty years after his death.  He wasn't remembered by his peers as an inspiration for their music.Consider Junior Brooks who recorded one single for Modern records in Little Rock in 1951.  The presumed B side, SHE'S THE LITTLE GIRL FOR ME, is a titanic recording, Brooks vocal being as great as, if not greater (MHO), than anything by Johnson.Junior Brooks died of a heart attack before his single was released.  So far as I know, nothing else was ever recorded by him.Think about it.  Would both Johnson and Brooks have gotten better if they'd lived?  Who is the \"greatest\"?

For the uninformed, these recordings are without a doubt the best place to start an appreciation for delta blues for two big reasons...First, Robert Johnson is arguably the greatest of all the delta bluesman and at least half his songs have become blues classics, so you can't know delta blues without knowing about RJ...Second, his music is much more accessible than most if not all of his contemporaries who generally recorded before the depression on inferior equipment....the tracks in this set were recorded in the late 30's so the recording here is generally much cleaner than those recorded in the previous decade and are hence are much more accessible..which brings me to the second topic...the SOUND....If you allready own the original 1991/1998 black box set, the sound of this box is WORLDS better...that box sounded like RJ was recorded under water, while this one sounds like he is enjoying life above it...it's that significant.  Conversely, if you own one or both of the \"King of the Delta Blues\" CD's, the sound here is definitely better (more high end with less noise), but not as drammatic as compared to the box.  Unfortunately, the packaging is nothing to write home about.  It's not particularly bad (the cd's are housed in a double jewel case with a decent booklet), but I would have thought that a release of this magnitude would have warranted something a little more special (see Bob Dylan Bootleg series)...I guess the execs wanted to keep the price down.  On the positive side, the track sequecing is the best ever (with all the alternates at the end of the disc instead of side by side with the original).  As a result, these CD's \"play\" much better if you still spin them the old fashioned way.  As a result of all of the above, I would strongly recommend that new and old fans alike get this set...having all his music in one great sounding place for $15 is such a ridiculous bargain that thinking about getting this music any other way doesn't make common or financial sense....\n", "val": 0.00026850783615373075}

{"text": "Yet another misfire... This is NOT the best choice for listening to Robert Johnson.This review is for the Robert Johnson Centennial 2 CD set.The overall sound quality still misses the mark by a wide margin... Robert often still sounds a bit too much like he is singing in a tunnel without any real bottom end in the sound spectrum.  It did not have to turn out that way - there are better representations of this material out there.Yes, there is a slight improvement in this Centennial set in terms of clarity over the two previous double CD box sets, but is that really saying very much?  Both of those earlier sets sounded really bad, and neither were worthy then nor now of any sort of bench mark status - it's not difficult to improve on crap!  Unfortunately many misguided and misinformed reviewers in this forum are basing their opinions on \"how much better\" this Centennial set is compared to the 1990 set!  That is setting the bar way too low!  A more realistic bench mark would be the two separate single CD releases of \"The King of the Delta Blues\" (KOTDB, vol. 1 & 2), the first volume of which was released in 1998.  On the KOTDB CDs we got a significant breakthough in sound quality (the first breakthrough was the much earlier gold disc release).  Some of the improvement on the KOTDB CDs was due to superior source material, but a lot of it simply had to do with EQ - you could FINALLY hear ALL of the lower bass registers on the KOTDB CDs - Robert's guitar for the first time was sonically on equal footing with Robert's voice instead of being drowned out in the background - in short, the music on KOTDB gained a very full, complete and satisfying sound spectrum.  He sounded like he was finally out of the tunnel and back in the room with you.  The reviews in Amazon for KOTDB were overwhelmingly positive at the time... even celebratory.  Nobody had any complaints about the KOTDB CDs.  You could now really hear even the room ambiance of the hotel room where these were recorded.Then along comes this latest Centennial release and the EQ was inexplicitly re-set back to the old dinosaur position of rolling off the bass - back to square one again!  Now you can argue all day long about RIAA curves and the microphones used or even the speed of the recordings - in fact, that sort of technical discussion seems to be all that some people are interested in!  Discussions about whether the source materials included metal masters or 78s or just tapes made in 1961 of long lost sources, etc. abound.  That is all fine and well, but you have to get your facts straight.  For example, even in the liners notes of the Centennial release I note some inconsistencies in terms of the discussion at large of what sources were used for the KOTDB CD.  In the Centennial insert booklet, on pg. 23, Steven LaVere , clearly states that the selections on the KOTDB CD \"...were all newly transferred from original discs...\"  I take this to mean that KOTDB was entirely sourced directly from 78 discs... Seems like a reasonable takeaway, right?  And yet in this very forum another reviewer emphatically insisted that I was \"misinformed\" and that many of the sources for the KOTDB CDs were actually from magnetic tape copies from 1961 transfers as opposed to directly from disc. Really?  Not according to Columbia's own literature as quoted above.  Be careful... there are a lot of so-called experts out there their grinding axes.... Misinformation abounds.Regardless, for what it's worth, consider a different way of looking at the EQ issue.  I actually play guitar.  I even play guitars similar in size to those that Johnson was known to use.  I have even had the opportunity to actually play a 1930's Kalamazoo - the same model guitar Robert is thought to have played on the 78s.  I can tell you that the Kalamazoo I played had a lot of bass - it was not rolled off at all!  When you palm-dampen the bass runs as Robert often does (think \"Sweet Home Chicago\") you get a surprising amount of low-end thumping bass.  But when I heard the Centennial CD version of \"Ramblin' On My Mind\" it sounded anemic - the signature booming sound you normally would expect to hear in up front in the foreground had faded to the background - weak and anemic.  Then I listened again to the KOTDB CD for the same cut... and there it is! - the missing bass is back with much more authority.  It is almost as if there is some sort of revisionist attempt here to change Robert Johnson into something other than what he really was.  I think the recording engineers have forgotten that there was only one microphone in the room that day - one mike to pick up both the vocals and the guitar.  Now if the mike is aimed at the vocals then OF COURSE the guitar is going to suffer in the mix, but that does not mean that the EQ cannot be adjusted to compensate - there is nothing sacred about a less than optimal original feed from the microphone. Now, of course one can argue all day long about what the original microphone picked up that day in the studio and what it did not pick up, etc.  Regardless, in my opinion the guitar I heard in the KOTDB CDs sounded realistic in terms of what you would actually hear in the real world - a lot of resonating bass with a nice \"thunk\" while the Centennial set comes off as anemic. If you are not familiar with how a live guitar sounds in a hotel room you can always watch and listen to the \"Sessions for Robert J.\" DVD where Eric Clapton actually plays Robert Johnson songs in the SAME hotel room where many of the Robert Johnson recordings were actually recorded back in the 1930s.  He also does several solo Robert Johnson songs in a Santa Monica hotel room.  Does Eric's guitar sound at all bass-shy in any of these settings?  I don't think so...  EQ is something the sound engineer has to make a decision about... and it is not only about reproducing the limitations of the microphone used, you can improve on bad conditions and compensate for faulty EQ - that's their job.  In my opinion, the right decision was made for the KOTDB CDs and the wrong decision was made for the Centennial set.  You may have a different opinion, but do yourself a favor and compare the two sets side by side and listen for yourself.... forget about all the discussions about RIAA curves and microphones and see which one actually SOUNDS better.  To me KOTDB wins hands down with a superior sound spectrum.  The Centennial set loses...So, in summary, I will readily concede that the Centennial set managed to reduce the distortion in Robert's voice and that the overall sound is \"cleaner\".  But, unfortunately, that slight improvement is almost completely negated by a lackluster EQ - i.e. there is hardly any mid-bass evident on this Centennial re-mastering - bass that is free for the asking on the KOTDB CDs.  Of course, any time you eliminate the bass to this extent the vocals can also SEEM to gain sharpness and clarity, but not really... it's just that the EQ brings the vocals up front by default.  You are still missing a lot of the music from the bottom end.  And, yes, I will also grant you that Columbia certainly did take out pops and crackles on this latest Centennial set - but, so what? Who really cares? There never was a lot of ticks and pops on these recordings to begin with.  Apparently four metal masters were used for the first time on CD for the Centennial set... which is great; but even the older CDs that were not direct transferred from first generation metal masters (KOTDB CDs for instance) already sounded pretty good in terms of hiss and pops - the problem was always more about distortion and EQ, not pops and ticks. Besides, if you listen to the very first cut on this Centennial set there still is a lot of hiss that was left in. No big deal one way or the other.Back to the bass or lack of it... even if you do attempt to compensate on the Centennial set by turning the bass knob all the way up to \"12\" you STILL are missing too much bass - it is STILL not anywhere near the bass levels on the unadjusted KOTDB CDs - that is how far off the mark the EQ on the Centennial set is!  Even fully cranking up the bass does not get this turkey up to where it should be.  Wow!  This is why I gave this set a one star.  It is also worth considering that this is the fifth time or even sixth time(!) Columbia has released a \"new and improved\" Robert Johnson collection.  In addition to this latest Centennial set there were two previous attempts at a \"complete\" two disc set - both of which were dismal failures, a gold disc that sounded great at the time and the two KOTDB CDs which seem today to be the only real breakthroughs so far in terms of the overall sound. Unfortunately this Centennial set has taken one step forward (lower distortion) and two steps back (crappy EQ - no bass).As a side note, here is a curious situation - the most recent Yazoo re-remaster reissues  of Charlie Patton (2010) sound perhaps even fresher and more three dimensional to my ears than this Centennial Robert Johnson set... and yet the source material for those Charlie Patton Yazoos are from really bad vinyl (some say those Patton Paramount discs were not even pressed on regular vinyl back in the 30's but instead pressed on the same material used for bowling balls!). What Yazoo was able to do with the Charlie Patton material was nothing short of miraculous. A fantastic resurrection of the music. And then compare that to this latest Centennial set from Columbia. You have to ask yourself, if the original metal masters are long lost for Charlie Patton, but Columbia has four original metal masters for Robert Johnson AND exceptionally clean sounding 78s to master from... why then do the Patton CDs sound as good or even better than the Centennial Johnson CDs? I think it is because Yazoo seems to know what they are doing.... and after five (or is it six attempts?) Columbia STILL cannot get it right.  Based upon the track record, who would you want to hire for this job?As I mentioned above, the only thing Columbia did do right here on this latest Robert Johnson Centennial set was to tame down some of the harshness in Robert's voice - very good job there, and you can turn up the volume more now without getting a harsh sound. But that is the only redeeming re-mastering choice made here... and the only reason you MIGHT want to purchase this set.So, my advice is to go back to the \"King of the Delta Blues\" CDs and stick with that. Yes, there is more hiss and noise and slightly more harshness at times in the vocals, but it is really not a problem for the listening experience and you get really FULL bass which is essential to the blues!Or.... your other option is to make your own personal \"re-master\" of this Centennial set.  I did this recently by using the equalizer function of a NERO-type application to narrowly boost just the low frequencies between 20hz to 800hz by about 6db.  You want to leave the high frequencies above 800hz alone as that is where Robert's tenor vocals reside and you do not need to change any of that.  Resulting CD-R gave me a very close approximation of where I think the EQ should be - again, no changes above 800hz but sharply below that point you boost everything up to +6 db.  Try it - I am very happy with the results.  If for some this results in too much bass then just back off to maybe Just +4db - it's up to you.  Perhaps your own homemade re-mastering might make this sow's ear into something worthwhile.\n", "val": 6.270414451137185e-05}

{"text": "It sounds like they don't believe the recent argument that the original recordings were sped up perhaps to at 81 rpm back in the day before the pressing. Record companies admitted to speeding up recordings back in the 30s. When I heard the album Steady Rollin' Man that slowed these songs to 78 rpm it was a revelation. A powerfull full throated man was singing. It was thrilling. Here, as on every release since 1937 his guitar and voice sound shrill, like a bluesy Alvin the chipmonk on meth on a toy guitar. He was a big man not a teenager or alien. It doesn't sound like a vocal style like Big Joe Williams. It sounds altered.  He may have used capos on the frets but to this extent is unlikely. I see Steady Rollin' Man is for sale used for a cent. Do yourself a favor and buy it. See where you stand on this controversy. There is a scientific way of checking the speed. Electricity used to record it will have made a background hum that would be the same hum the city generators made. Records of at what power they ran the generators in 1937 probably exist. This was done for the 64 year old Woody Guthrie recording now released as \"Live Wire\".

{"text": "No need to review the incredible music of Robert Johnson. Along with Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Bob Dylan he was among the most influential American artists of the 20th century--despite the fact that his entire catalog fits on two CDs.My review focuses instead on this reissue compared to the 1990 Complete Recordings, as good as they were for their time. That version is like standing on the porch, peering through a dirty, grease-smudged window into the room where 75 years ago Robert Johnson sat in a creaky wooden chair, wailing his heart out while playing his amazing guitar with what sounds like four hands. This new set transports you into the room, sitting right next to Johnson--not just hearing the music but feeling it. There is still the crackle, hiss, and pop of these old recordings. Some future advance in processing technology might someday remove this noise while leaving all the other audio unscathed, and it's debatable whether this would be good or bad. But on these discs Robert Johnson's music comes through brighter, cleaner, fuller, and more alive than I have ever heard it.I can't speak to whether this set simply restores something that the 1990 versions inadvertently muffled compared to even earlier versions. But I can't imagine a better set out there, and for any serious student of American music or just music period, these recordings in some form are absolutely essential.

But, these recordings, while remarkably clear and free of distracting artifacts, do not in my opinion, represent anything better than the King of the Delta Blues Singers LP's that Columbia released in 1961 and 1970, respectively. They are just \"different\".While I appreciate the extras and alternates that have been found over the years, I simply can't get past the cold, clinical, & sterile sound of these \"remastered\" recordings. Granted they sound better than the muffled lifeless 1990 & 1996 Complete Recordings box set. But, they still lack the \"life\" of the old LP's. I can't speak for the sound of the original 78's as I don't own them, given their scarcity and cost these days.In the end, I feel we are left with a revisionist view of Mr. Johnson's work. Just listen to the primary version of Cross Road Blues on this set (not the alternate) and compare it to the 1961 LP.

{"text": "I must say, my expectations for \"Smother,\" Wild Beasts' third album in merely three years, was pretty high. \"Two Dancers\" was such a triumph for the band. They had grown up so much since \"Limbo, Panto,\" which was such a testosterone filled wet dream (albeit a good one!). \"Two Dancers\" seamlessly infused the band's love of lyrically sexual themes and creative dreamscapes. I still regard their sophomore effort to be one of the best and most significant albums of the past ten years! It simply changed my musical life. However, nothing prepared me for another shot at greatness. 'Smother' rendered me, well, smothered in the best sense one can possibly mean. I'm confident in saying this is album of the year material. Sorry PJ Harvey, you'll have to make some room. '\"Smother\" is aptly titled. There are so many layers of rich and complex elements to this album, it's quite a challenge for one not to be overwhelmed by its sheer beauty. Hayden Thorpe's wildly popular falsetto is balanced by Tom Fleming's deep sensual croon. Each has their chance to shine, and at times they are playing off one another to dazzling effect ('Reach A Bit Further').  \"Lion's Share\" is a fantastic opener. A deep pulsing synth radiates as Thorpe's vocals creep in as if he's singing directly into your ear. Lion's share is an idiomatic expression meaning the lion takes all. So in natural Wild Beasts fashion, Thorpe is conquering his love, \"I take you in my mouth like a lion takes his game.\"It's perhaps the band's first fully realized minimalist approach, and the results are striking. \"Bed of Nails\" is a dance song about doing anything for love like lying on a bed of nails. Masochistic, perhaps, but isn't everyone a masochist when they're in love<> There's also a sweet helping of literary references to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Shakespeare's Hamlet. \"Plaything\" is deliciously dirty, sexy and sinister, quite often at the same time. \"New squeeze, take off your chemise and I'll do as I please.\" As you can probably guess, sex still dominates the Wild Beasts frontier. However, their approach is very straightforward without it being overbearing. It's tastefully done. Instead of a complete sexual throw down (\"Limbo, Panto\" style), they are taking their time, allowing themselves and you to enjoy the experience. \"End Come Too Soon\" may be the best example of this. At around the 5:30 minute mark, there is a climax of blissful piano and fuzzy electric guitar right before it takes off and then it's all over. Within that climax, though, Thorpe repeats, rather desperately and regretfully, \"it's too soon. The end went and came too soon.\" I thought it was too soon as well. Luckily I was more than ready to go back for seconds. If you were a fan of \"Two Dancers,\" \"Smother\" is a rather nice companion. If you're just curious, trust me, it's worth a blind buy.OTHER HIGHLIGHTS (not mentioned above)\"Loop the Loop\"\"Deeper\"\"Invisible\"\n", "val": 0.04978914558887482}
{"text": "This is the third album from the Kendal wonders, Wild Beasts, who are by far the best British band of the past three years. \"Smother\" is an album that is so different from its predecessor, the ostentation of \"Two Dancers\" is reigned in and the brazenness pulled back. Guitars are noticeable by their absence and in come elegant sweeping synths, combined with deep seductive melodies and sophisticated soundscapes. This album draws more on Talk Talk of the era of \"New Grass\" than it does the Smiths, which was \"Two Dancers\" primary source. Undoubtedly some will be completely alienated or find this a very slow burner that appears underwhelming with its lack of hedonism. Alternatively others who carefully listen will hear one of the most strikingly attractive albums produced by any rock band in recent times. At the core of this is the vocal partnership of Hayden Thorpe and Tom Fleming that has developed into one of music's great double acts. Thorpe's wonderfully contained falsetto reminds you on times of Anthony Hegarty but on \"Smother\" his performance is matched by Fleming's deeper and richer bass voice. Both sing on the sumptuous opener \"Lion's share\" which starts with a huge pulsating synth and Thorpe announcing, \"I find you hid in mirrorville/creature of the deep/waifish as a widow/and without sufficient sleep\". It is complimented by a rolling piano, all sorts of studio trickery and is an absolute sultry joy of a song. Next up is the most immediate and commercial song on the album \"Bed of Nails\" which could have appeared on Fever Ray's recent pop epic. Fleming takes the lead on the \"Deeper\" and it is one of the albums standouts with slow and refrained piece of minimalist funk. Guitars finally make an appearance on \"Loop the loop\" but as a melodic backdrop to a swelling song of real warmth and beauty (there is not one guitar solo on the whole album). \"Plaything\" reminds you of some of the preoccupations of James Blake with its electro atmospherics and emphasis on manipulating tension.Fleming takes the helm again for \"Invisible\" a much grander beast than \"Deeper\" and it is followed by the single \"Albatross\" which sees Thorpe at his most operatic on a song of undulating wonder. The last three tracks are led by \"Reach a bit further\" possibly the weakest song on the album. But the menacing \"Burning\" which Fleming infuses with the ghostly aura of David Sylvain's \"Ghosts\" brilliantly compensates this. Finally comes the best song on the album the near eight minute \"End come to soon\" a sensual erotic synth epic where Thorpe alludes at one point to someone \"Whose butter-fingers rip me like bread/Whose dirty mouth would have me merry head\". The song gently fades in its mid section but returns with a vengeance at around 5.50 minutes marking a triumphant end to the album. \"Smother\" also manages to leave off the album the deeply slow and gentle title track, which frankly is a bit odd (it's the B side to Albatross), but it shows a band with songs and talent to spare. This third album represents a journey so far-flung from the \"Brave, bulging, buoyant, clairvoyants\" of their debut \"Limbo Panto\" as to make that sound like a very distant relative. As it stands this exquisite album confirms the Wild Beasts as the main and extraordinary contenders for the crown of British music.\n", "val": 0.026639435440301895}
{"text": "I bought this 2DVD/2CD set the moment I saw it was released because I enjoy most of their released music and have not been able to see them live yet.Both DVD's are LIVE, one electric performance and the other a acoustic performance.  Both have excellent sound and video.  When you put the DVD in, the main menu comes up and you can select to play all songs or go to chapters.  No other settings or splash screens come up.  I listened in stereo with subwoofer and didn't feel I needed to adjust audio.The CD contains the audio tracks from both concerts.  I enjoy that the performances are different than the studio versions, most songs I enjoy better than the studio version on their previous three releases.The \"electric\" concert is basically the same concert that's being played on Palladia, I believe a few more songs come from the DVD than you see on TV.  The quality on my big screen shows up a little better using the DVD than through HDTV.  There is some visual effects added to the production of the video.  I usually hate that king of thing, but it doesn't reduce the enjoyment much.  In fact, you might notice they \"shake\" the video as if the camera was experiencing the impact of the loud music.  I thought this added to the live feel of the music, and I actually liked the added intensity to the experience.The \"acoustic\" concert was not a canned unplugged or stripped down version.  In fact, they had more band members on on the stage.  The music is full and the performanc energetic despite using acoustic guitars.  The drummer is there, and they added an additional percussion member.  The audience was very different, seated people without the moshing and body surfing.  The lead singer had a few minutes of \"storytelling\" before each song, which gives background on the influence going into writing and/or what certain things mean.  I enjoy the fact that their message is not political, it deals with things everyday people in their audience experience.  On the audio CD, they stripped the \"storytelling\" and started the track with \"this song is called....\".In summary, I am glad I bought this 2DVD/2CD combo, even though I already saw the one concert on Palladia.  The entire package is live performances, nothing from the studio.  Because I like the music as performed better than the studio versions, I'm glad I can rip music directly from the CD for my playlist, instead of looking for special DVD audio ripping software to accomplish the task.\n", "val": 0.007126327604055405}

{"text": "...much of the music in this concert came. I love Shinedown, they're my favorite band above all others and although I expected a lot of the songs to be touched up, I didn't expect it to be quite as much as the dvds had done. When I say this, I refer to the front man, Brent Smith's vocal performance. Two of my favorite songs, \"I Dare You,\" and \"Diamond Eyes\" sounded like the studio album track was just being played over the video and having seen the band 3 times, I've never heard the vocals sound even close to similar to the album, since he usually sings around the higher notes of the chorus (while still sounding great.) I realize it's a harder song to sing but couldn't they have kept a more raw recording?My other big complaint was that the songs just played one after another, nothing of Brent speaking in between. I realize that they'd never put all of the concert on the DVD but to have it jump from song to song with no transition in between just makes it feel rushed. I also own the band's earlier concert dvd, \"Live From the Inside\" which in my opinion (despite being a rougher cut and lower budget from the band's earlier days) is the superior between the two. As it gave me a connection and proper introduction to who these talented musicians were.Anyways, I won't dwell on just the negatives; in fact, I'll move on.The music all sounds fantastic, and the band shows off as they always do just how entertaining they can be on a stage in front of thousands. The light show is a spectacle of it's own as the band uses an entire arsenal of special effects to give the viewer the best experience they can. All in all, a great album,  despite the setbacks mentioned earlier, I highly recommend it.\n", "val": 0.028152653947472572}

The acoustic set is basically like a two hour episode of VH1 Storytellers, and Brent Smith's passion for Shinedown's music comes through.

Shinedown does a mind-blowing, stripped down version of the Foo Fighters' \"Times Like These\" and a fantastic \"With a Little Help From My Friends\" during the acoustic show.I bought this in the PX here in Afghanistan and the past three hours watching these DVDs were the best diversion from the day-to-day grind I could have asked for.

{"text": "I initially had a hard time finding this product because it's listed as an audio CD rather than concert DVD.  So let's be clear on what this is: a DVD of an acoustic concert in Kansas City, a DVD of an electric concert in Washington state, and audio CDs of each.  Quite a value for the price!I recommend watching the electric concert first.  It absolutely rocks from start to finish, with really good video editing - a lot of care clearly went into this.  This is a mature and confident version of Shinedown, full of power and theatrics befitting a live rock concert, but also a lot of heartfelt emotion, especially evident in both the vocals and the lyrics.  I watched the whole concert in one setting, then immediately went back and watched some more of it, then watched the whole thing again the next day.  It really permeated me.Then I said, 'OK, let me try this acoustic thing', feeling somewhat wary that it would be wimpy.  And indeed, when I started watching it, it did feel that way, like they wanted to rock but the acoustic instruments were holding them back.  But I stuck with it, and am very glad I did.  This acoustic concert perfectly complements the electric one, and puts the songs and the band in a whole new light.  They set aside the pomp of rock stars, dress like gentlemen, and let their guard down, letting us see that they're sensitive people, artists who're comfortable sharing their real selves with the audience in an intimate way.  This is very much heightened by Brent Smith's articulate presentations of the stories behind the songs, told with deep emotion and clearly strongly connecting with the audience, with many apparently almost moved to tears at some moments.This is a special band, and this DVD/CD collection is a superb presentation of their artistry.  Recommended to any fan of mature rock music, and certainly to all fans of Shinedown.\n", "val": 0.02740148827433586}

{"text": "I'm a \"casual\" Shindown fan - one who knows the \"hits\" well, but hasn't gone real deep with them yet.  I ordered this new Shinedown live effort because I really like what I know of them, and the reviews sounded like it was worth it.  It's 2 concerts - 1 \"electric\" and 1 acoustic, and they give you an audio CD and a DVD from each show.  So, it's 4 discs and 2 shows for under $30.  What's pretty cool is how different the 2 shows are.  On the electric disc, it's full-out ear bleeders.  On the acoustic, they seem incredibly comfortable stripping all that down and really embracing a mellow vibe.  Both concerts create incredible energy, but they go about it in very different ways.  The only duplicated song that even sounds remotely the same between the 2 shows is the amazing cover of \"Simple Man\", and even that has some different arrangements.As someone pointed out, the acoustic concert is done in a \"Storytellers\" style, which I usually like a lot.  Hearing the story behind the song and then the song is really cool to me.  But, the lead singer drones on a bit too long, and while I'm happy that he is clean and sober, I could do without some of the \"preachy\" stuff.  He seems to start making a point, gets lost, and just keeps talking to find his way out.  To be fair, some of it is heart-warming, like when he talkes about how having a child impacted him so positively.There is no doubt that these guys are a powerful live act, with incredible vocals and powerful playing.  There is a ton of music here, and I'm still just getting into it.  But, my early favorite is their cover of \"With a Little Help From My Friends\" with uber-talented Will Hoge (the warm-up act).  They do the Joe Cocker version of the song with the two guys trading vocals.  It's flat-out amazing, and with all due respect to Cocker, they \"steal\" this song from him and make it their own.  But basically everything here is really good, and you can't go wrong for the price.\n", "val": 0.013545284047722816}

If I hadn't heard the originals I would have thought that this set was an amazing example of a great band. Having said that, I still believe it's a great value for a box set, I just wish the vocals were better. Brent Smith is still a fine singer but, from now on I will stick to their studio disks. Don't let this review keep you from getting this set, it's still a great value, and the band is amazing, but if you are a fan of their studio work you might be just as disappointed as I am.\n", "val": 0.006411563605070114}

In my opinion, Shinedown is one of the best live bands out there and this set does a good job of capturing their live show.  If you are a fan of Shinedown, buying this should be a no brainer.  The acoustic set is amazing, not only is it nice to hear the songs played a little differently than normal, but in between songs Brent explains the meaning and inspiration behind many of the songs.  The electric set isn't quite as good, while the performance itself is fine, it is heavily edited which results in it feeling like a series of individual performances instead of a cohesive concert.  If I could rate them separately I'd give the acoustic set 5 stars and the electric set 4 stars.  I've already watched the acoustic show several times and will watch it several more times, I'm sure.  I've watched the electric show once through and I'll eventually watch it again, but it didn't blow me away like the acoustic show, which I wanted to watch again right after finishing it the first time.Highlights:Brent talking about the meanings in between songs during the acoustic showBoth cover songs (Times Like These and With A Little Help From My Friends) are very well doneBrent talking about the band's experience during their Middle East showsInclusion of the two non-album tracks (Diamond Eyes and Her Name Is Alice) in the electric showShinedown puts on a great live show and these DVDs showcase thatNegatives:Editing of between song footage in electric set is disappointingSound is a little bit too clean and doesn't sound quite as raw and energetic as the band sounds liveNo bonus features includedBottom Line:Buy it, you won't regret it.

{"text": "Let's all face it - Shinedown's music and lyrics are great, but it is Brent Smith's vocals that make this one of the greatest bands around.  That being said, I was sorely disappointed during much of this CD and DVD combo set - we'll get to that later, but first, let's talk about the many positives of this set:Now, don't get me wrong - this is a spectacular value - 2 CDs AND 2 DVDs of two distinct concerts for the price that you'd normally pay for maybe two CDs or just one DVD!  You can't beat that anywhere, and this really shows how Shinedown cares for their fans.  This set features all of Shinedown's current hits from the radio and some spectacular gems that are just as good as anything playing on the radio today.  This is like getting two Greatest Hits albums, one electric and one acoustic, PLUS the DVDs!But unfortunately, there was something missing.  I listened to the Washington concert, and was pretty impressed, especially with the superb setlist of all their hits...although I wouldn't have minded a few more of their other songs that I can't hear every day on the radio.  One thing that I noticed was missing was that the singer (Brent Smith) sometimes did not hit the amazing high notes from the albums.  I thought that the acoustic set would be the perfect place to hit them all since he would not have to compete with the guitars as much - what a letdown I got!  He didn't even try for most of the high parts in the acoustic set.  I don't know if he was losing his voice at that show, or what, but it wasn't even nearly as good as listening to the radio.  When you hear I Dare You (or just about any Shinedown song) on the radio, those soaring vocals are like a body shot...your heart races, your blood pressure raises, and you're pumped!  But, he's an octave lower on the \"high\" parts of the acoustic set, which not only doesn't have the same feeling, but it actually sounds pretty bad at times - again, he may have been losing his voice, or didn't want to drown out the guitars...but whatever it is, it doesn't work.The electric concert would get 5 stars, but I could only give the acoustic concert CD 2 stars if I rated them separately (the Acoustic DVD would get 3 because of extra information given for each song).  So, average them, and add in the incredible value, and you get 4 stars - nothing to sneeze at, but still not what I would have expected from what I consider to be the best rock band around right now.\n", "val": 6.179473712109029e-05}

Shinedown has very little exposure here in San Antonio, for reasons unknown to me, but I set up my old stereo system, turned off the lights, and discovered that there is still at least one group capable of entertaining in the old style.  I am so happy that I read the other customer's review and that I took the chance.  Shinedown is an excellent band with outstanding music; I particularly liked the audience interaction and the showmanship.\n", "val": 0.006105285603553057}
{"text": "I can agree with some of the reviews on here, that stated that it is to produced. But, that would only go for the Live in Washington State DVD. It is a great set, it really is a great representation of how a Shinedown concert is, although the producers of that DVD should have left it more raw.As for the Anything & Everything DVD all I can say is that is absolutely amazing. I attended one of the live shows and this DVD is, in my opinion, just as good if not better than the show I went to. Brent Smith's (vocalist) voice is unbelievable for this show, the crowd interaction is great, and the storytelling is phenomenal. With 3 cover songs on it, it surprises even the most die hard fans, with Shinedown putting their own twists on the songs. The cover songs are the obvious Simple Man - which is the best simple man cover ever, The Foo Fighters - Times Like These, which is great. The last cover is With a Little Help from My Friends, featuring the concerts' opening act Will Hoge (Who is really good as well).The price is really low, for 2 dvd's and 2 cd's of the songs, and over 3 hours of live concerts, you can't pass this up if you like Shinedown and even if you enjoy great live music.\n", "val": 0.02258298359811306}

You can pay about the same ($20.53 as of today) for a physical copy and get 2 DVD discs of the shows along with the music offered here on CD!!  So, something is not right.

{"text": "In an era where there is a dearth of truly innovative, talented and creative rock bands worth spending your hard earned cash on, Shinedown is one of the notable handful of so called \"hard rock\"/alternative metal active bands out there on my short list of bands worth paying money to listen to together with Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, Seether and Trapt and a few others. Having never seen them live (who has money for $70-$100 dollar concert tickets these days) I was interested to see the included DVDs and like the idea of a live unplugged version and a live plugged in version. Clearly these guys have stand out talent with a lead singer whose voice has one of the best octave ranges I have heard since the days of Roger Daltrey and Robert Plant. Having said that, it's a shame that on not one, but both \"live\" albums, they have so little confidence in their own talent, that they need pre-recorded background music (violin strings - are you kidding me?). Even the so called acoustic version has clearly electric solos and orchestrated pre-recorded background music. The music is good enough without the schmaltz boys! I get the Foo Fighters cover, anything to get air play and it fills the niche of radio programs that feature covers, but it's not like they dramatically change or improve the original which was a recent huge hit or that they are re-discovering a lost classic or underplayed original and introducing it to a new generation. Again, it suggests a lack of confidence in their own talent. I can't imagine Jimmy Page playing a Pete Townshend hit. All the show antics, heavy make-up, audience participation etc. are par for the course these days - anything to make it look like everyone is having a great time, and these guys are undoubtedly good showmen - even the bassist's enthusiam is contagious, but somehow it does not go with an acoustic performance - Kurt sitting in a chair with a sweater on comes to mind - STP sitting on stools etc. I think the plugged in show would also benefit from less commercial gimmickry. Just be yourselves boys - you have the talent. Skip all that Hollywood slickness. In short, the music is original and the band one of the best hard rockers currently active. The double CD for its cost including two dvds is certainly a good deal. It would be better however to see this band mature a little and have confidence enough in their own exceptional talent to simply ask the audience to enjoy the music live and enjoy the band as they really are.\n", "val": 0.00037396035622805357}

{"text": "This is the CD/DVD combo set that Shinedown were made to create. The power of their standard live show, couple with the intimacy and inspiration of their acoustic tour de force is spellbinding. The live show is simply an amazing concert.  Enough said.The utter baring of singer Brent Smith's heart has always been apparent in the lyrics and power of the songs that Shinedown has put forth.  However, when they strip it down as they did in their acoustic set in Kansas City's Midland Theater, and pair it with Smith's stories and explanations of each song, his soul and heart are completely put out on stage for the world to see.  I watched this disc with rapt attention as Smith absolutely owned the stage and kept the audience completely spellbound.  You can see the power of his words, the depth of his message in the faces and eyes of the concert goers.There were many times during this DVD that I was moved to tears by Smith and his amazingly talented band mates - drummer Barry Kerch, guitarist Zach Meyers and bassist Eric Bass.  The retooling of their hard edged music is masterful and a wonderful accomplishment.  The videography and editing is amazing.  Beautiful work all the way around.In short, there are not enough stars to truly rate this set as I would like to.\n", "val": 0.04512927308678627}

If you believe this is hyberbole or an over-exaggeration, simply purchase this CD and judge for yourself.  Listen again and again, and lose yourself in its excellence.  It will be borderline criminal if it doesn't go platinum at the very least.  It's disappointing to watch artists of far less talent and creativity sell millions of records while an artist of Musiq Soulchild's caliber has yet to reach the top echelon of the recording industry as he richly deserves.  This is Musiq's best, most cohesive, most melodic CD.  Each track is sensational.  Absolutely no filler here.  Superb production and vocals throughout.  It's impossible to pick a favorite track.  It's like asking a parent to pick a favorite child.  If I were forced to, my top five favorite tracks, in random order are: Sayido; Backtowhere; Dowehaveto; Yes; and Likethesun.  I didn't think Musiq could possibly top Luvanmusiq and Soulstar, but he most definitely has.Lovers of R&B music have an obligation to purchase this CD.

{"text": "In his decade long career, Philadelphia native Musiq Soulchild has a great, if often overlooked, body of work. It all started with his 2000 debut \"Aijuswanaseing\", he crafted a stellar successful debut- despite his ties to Def Jam Recordings. Not that it was a bad label, but at the time Def Jam had a long history of underpromoting its R&B acts (Remember Alyson Williams, The Black Flames, Tashan, Playa or Case?). He followed that album up with his 2002 sophomore album \"Juslisen\" and a year later with the criminally underrated \"Soulstar\". While he was on the rise, his label was on the decline as far as promotion... so he wanted off the label. In 2006, he was placed in a unique label trade off between himself and rapper Fabolous-  with Def Jam's Musiq Soulchild going to Atlantic, while Atlantic's Fabolous went to Def Jam. After a four year hiatus, he resumed his career with his first album for Atlantic- 2007's \"Luvanmusiq\", followed a year later with the experimental \"OnMyRadio\". After laying low for a few years, he returned with his sixth recording, \"Musiqinthemagiq\".One thing that's obvious about the record is the noticeable absence of his longtime producers Ivan \"Orthodox\" Barias & Carvin \"Ransum\" Haggins. They have been replaced by Wyclef Jean's producing partner Jerry \"Wonda\" Duplessis, who produces much of the album- including the first single, the Swizz Beatz featured \"Anything\". Producer Lil' Ronnie produces the uptempo song \"Single\", a song about Musiq stuck in the dilemma of meeting an unattached woman while he's in a relationship. Swedish production team Element handles two songs- the ballad \"Yes\" as well as the 60's inspired \"Lovecontract\". On the track \"Dowehaveto\", Musiq tries to reason with a seemingly argumentative significant other and takes a woman to task who relegated him to being friendzoned on \"Befriends\". The album ends with its best song, the synth heavy \"Likethesun\". Overall, \"Musiqinthemagiq\" is another solid album from Musiq Soulchild- even if he seems content with taking the safe route and rarely stepping outside of his comfort zone.\n", "val": 0.003149125026538968}

{"text": "Musiq Soulchild has been one of the more consistent R&B/Neo-Soul singers of the last decade. And the reason for that is probably beccause he has a neo-soul style, but he incorporates contemporary R&B touches into his music as well, where as most neo-soul singers stick to that sub genre, Musiq knows how to balance the two extremely well. And Musiqinthemagiq is just another continuation of his already bolstering discography. While the album is definitely far from his best, it's still a typical Musiq album for the most part. The only really big change in style on this album is that he works with some brand new producers that he's never worked with before. There's not one producer on this album that's produced on any of his other albums. Which is a gift and a curse kind of. I always liked the producers he worked with before, (Mainly Carvin & Ivan, and Warryn Campbell) especially when he would switch it up and throw a big name in the mix like the Underdogs or Neff U. But on Musiqinthemagiq, he switches it up completely by enlisting a completely new crew of producers, Jerry Wonda being the executive producer. Because of this, Musiqinthemagiq does have a different style than his previous albums, Musiq himself called this album his most radio friendly album to date and most commercial record. And while part of that is true, due to songs like the funky first single \"Anything\" and the mid tempo contemporary track \"Single\", or the mid tempo banger \"Backtowhere\" which could have been on any Trey Songz or Chris Brown album, the album still has the genuine gentleman R&B feel that all of his previous albums do. There is still plenty of vintage Musiq on this album, like the mid tempo ode to marriage \"Sayido\", which reminds me a lot of \"Teachme\". Or \"Befriends\" also has the vintage neo-soul sound that Musiq fans have come to love. But what keeps this album from being a true stand out, is that while there is a fair amount of good material on the album, towards the end of the album it starts to drag, and the lack of ANY big name producers becomes more and more evident as the album drags on, the songs almost start to blend together, making it hard to distinguish what songs are the keepers and what ones are the duds. With a little more focus, and maybe some better production, this could have been one of his better albums, but in the end it ended up just being solid... nothing amazing or mind blowing, but a solid addition to his discography... if you liked any of his previous albums, you will get enjoyment out of this one as well, just don't expect anything as good as Juslisen or even Luvanmusiq for that matter...\n", "val": 0.004670511931180954}
{"text": "I've been checking out this guy back as far as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Aijuswanaseing/dp/B000051Y10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aijuswanaseing</a>&nbsp;days. Honestly,from each album to the other I found his music to be a tad uneven to the ears;on the edge of brilliant one moment,hardly worth mentioning the next. It's one of the reasons I haven't really checked out a lot of new music in general until the last few years. Being an album listener in general...a few good songs don't usually hold water for me. Sure maybe growing up on all that 60's,70's and early 80's music did spoil me to a degree. It did many of us. But whatever the case I respected this mans musical vision and wanted to hear him grow into himself. With his wide range of influences-from the kind of old school music that inspires hip-hop/R&B and neo soul to that same music inspired BY older music itself he does create an excellent full circle perspective in how his music deals with the past,present and the future.  Now truth me told:this album really gets things off to a strong start with two of it's strongest cuts. Featuring Swizz \"Mr. Alicia Keys\" Beatz \"Anything\" is a terrific song,a modern day revival of early 80's post disco \"boogie\" that's both funky and electronic enough to keep a lot of magic in the music. \"Single\" takes a similar if somewhat more subdued approch to the same idea. Aside from the 100% Sam Cooke late 50's R&B/pop sendup of \"Love Contract\" other songs such as \"Sayido\",\"Silver & Gold\",\"Backtowhere\",\"Waitingstill\",\"Dowehaveto\" and \"Befriends\" take a kitchen sink attitude towards the production-he throws acoustic soul,pop,funk and some modern hip-hop ideas into it but all with a very clear focus. And that goes for the lyrics to,especially on the latter song mentioned where Musiq is dealing with his feelings of love for someone being just as important as her insistance they \"are just friends\". He shows sensativity AND confidence in his love songs,something of a lost art with so many like him looking to be hyper aggresive or plain spineless.  The album ends again on a high note with \"Likethesun\",a combination of 80's electro funk and old school hip-hop sounds showcasing the \"video game\" production style along with the orchestrated synth washes for a sonically dramatic and musically satisfying combination. It's matched only by the great passion expressed in the lyrics. Turns out here Musiq has a really good program of music in regard to consistancy and vision. He's not going out of his way to appeal exactly to any particular type of audience. He's just pulling together all the best qualities of his music,lyrics and songwriting and putting it out on the table for all to hear. That way he doesn't miss anything or anybody. Trying too little with ones music can indeed force you to miss the mark. But trying too hard to make music \"all things to all people\" can be equally as problematic. In this case that balance is achieved and then some. So far 2011 has been an excellent year for R&B of all different sorts. And if that little trend continues........I do see a strong rebirth to come.\n", "val": 0.004884973634034395}
{"text": "Unlike some high profile R&B artist, I will never get tired of buying a Musiq album. Each one has a different vibe. It is perfect that he has decided to drop another album to kick off the summer. \"Musiqinthemagiq\" comes just in time for the summer cookouts and family reunions.First off Musiq is under a new management team. It may seem like boring news, but this has changed the style from what you are used to hearing from a Musiq album. Gone are long time collaborators Wayne Campbell, JR Totem & Orthodox Ransum. In are producers like August Rigo, The Element & Jesse Wilson. The problem with working with new producers is it takes time to gel. Songs like \"Silver&Gold\" takes Musiq in a place he doesn't need to be. \"Lovecontract\" has a weird Rapheal Saadiq sound. The lead single \"Anything\" gets the party started. This album is less on the slow jams (There are none) and heavy on dance grooves. \"Waitingstill\" is the closest to a slow song. The Jesse Wilson produced, \"Donthaveto\" is the gem of this album. It starts a trio of no skip songs including the beautifully written \"Bestfriend\" and \"Yes\".Musiq has always has always been able to find a good medium between slow grooves and mid tempo songs. The lack of slow jams makes this album not as good as his last two. I rank this somewhere between \"Soulstar\" and \"Juslisen\". This album takes it back to his early \"Aijuswenasing\" days. As a long time Musiq fan, I enjoyed this album. A couple of his classic slow songs would have been nice. But overall I am not disappointed. I think there is no doubt that Musiq has been the most consistent male R&B artist over the past 10 years.\n", "val": 0.003483666805550456}

{"text": "I'm a huge fan of Musiq and have followed his career from its beginning and even though I didn't immediately warm up to the lead single, ANYTHING I still bought the cd because I just knew that there'd be songs for me to fall in love with.Once I got the cd I was initially very disappointed to see that Musiq didn't work with long-time writing & production collaborators, Ivan Barias & Carvin Haggins - I just think that they are \"dialed in\" to Musiq as an artist and create magical songs together.  I do, however respect Musiq for working with new producers because it could get stale working with the same people over and over so I was curious to hear the direction of this album.  One great thing is that Musiq's hallmark of singing about love & relationships remains - he is one of few young guys who have respectful and honest lyrics about love from a man's perspective and I appreciate that.On to the album -ANYTHING w/ Swizz Beats - I like this track moreso for the sample used, I'm not a Swizz fan but he doesn't take over the track.  Being able to see the video so many times prior to the album release really helped me warm up to the song.SINGLE - heavy synthy beats used kind of overshadow his vocals, not a fave.SAY I DO - Musiq is singing at the very height of his range which I found extremely unpleasant to listen to.  This just doesn't sound like Musiq and I strongly dislike this track.LOVE CONTRACT and SILVER & GOLD - both are reminiscent of 60's sounds, I love the instrumentation & arrangement of both which give the tracks an old school/nu school feel.WAITING STILL - again Musiq is singing in a very high key which to me is very unpleasant to hear.  I don't like this track although the sentiment of the lyrics as with SINGLE are nice, his singing is \"no muy bueno\".BACKTOWHERE - midtempo, melodic track that has a somewhat busy production but on which Musiq's vocals shine.DOWEHAVETO - love the musical arrangement.BEFRIENDS - heartfelt lyrics about a relationship breakup from a man's perspective.YES & MEDICINE - melodic & accessible tracks on which Musiq sound great.LIKETHESUN - although the production is very busy and seems to compete with his vocals, his voice isn't truly overshadowed and I really like this track.Musiq has been in this industry for 10 years now so he has definitely created a lane for himself that has made me love his music; as I mentioned earlier I appreciate his working with other producers to shake up his sound.  I was initially disappointed that there wasn't a ballad or two that instantly spoke to my heart but overall there is enough good stuff on the album that I can recommend it to fans.\n", "val": 0.004344965796917677}

{"text": "One thing I can say about Musiq is he is extremely consistent! I absolutely LOVE his new album! It is really refreshing to know there are artists out there that do not cave into te the pressures of society; singing about sexual innuendoes, degrading women, and not abandoning their true R&B roots! Not only does Musiq PREVAIL with this album, but once again, he makes sure to let women know that they are love, appreciated, and valued! Musiq is one of the very few R&B artists out there who not only gives his listener a reminder that he will never abandon his R&B roots, but he also shows us (his listeners) that he focuses more on good music instead of what sounds good in a nightclub! When I first got this album, I was INSTANTLY in love with the R&B, Soul, Hip-Hop (but not over the top) flavor! My personal favorites are:-Anything-Single-Say I Do-Back To Where-Do We Have To-Yes (my absolute favorite; 20,000 stars! lol)-Medicine (my second favorite (15,000 stars! lol)-Like the SunThe only song that I just cannot help but skip is Love Contract. Not to say there is anything wrong with the song because it actually contains positive lyrics, but there is something about the rhythm that I just cannot vibe to!  Other than that, I am THROUGHLY impressed with Musiq, his vocal ability, his eye for great music, and ALWAYS reminding women that there are good guys that love us for our minds (not our bodies) and are truly not afraid to express that in their music! I applaud you for your music flare Musiq! You seriously have yet to disappoint me and once again...I look forward to your future projects! Thank you so much keeping R&B alive!!PS: If you like Musiq Soulchilds' new album, make sure you also check out Bobby V's new album \"Fly On The Wall!\" In my opinion, those are two of the most IMPRESSIVE albums I have heard this year! As it is...it's hard to find REAL R&B, but both of these artists remind you that R&B artists are still out there and love the genre!!\n", "val": 0.0399286113679409}

Let us decide for ourselves, Doug.  Honestly, one of his objections was the cameramen not knowing what to do and some of it turning out somewhat avant garde.  Personally I thought that was valuable as the show was filmed in a place not exactly conducive to comedy being filmed.  On to the comedy, I'm not a fan of Stanhope's style.  I watched this at a friends house who's a fan.  My previous exposure to him was in the Aristocrats, and after seeing this I saw him on Louie.  My main problem with his comedy is there's nothing to it. When he spouts off about stuff, I  instantly doubt he actually feels that way about it. He continuously seems to be trying to simply get a rise out of the crowd. Good, that's his job and a lot of comics don't do as much, however, it also doesn't make him funny.  The appeal is obvious for some people as they like comics who go up and tear into the crowd while saying abrasive things.  Violent Non-conformism, great, and drunk too.  This one's a winner.  The guy seems nice enough, but his world weariness is tiresome and his vice doesn't produce laughs for me.  The special looks cool at times though, and catches a visceral drunken quality that's boring most of the time.  I'll probably watch one more special before I give up on the guy, but he won't miss me if I don't convert.  A ton of cds, a number of specials, he's found an audience.

No need to mention the five Grammy awards, the number of US presidents they've performed in the White House for, the admiration music fans and musicians alike have for the Blind Boys--just listen to what they've been releasing and that should be enough proof.\"Take The High Road\" falls in line with this recent momentum. This time, they pair old-school gospel with Nashville country. Using traditional recording and arranging methods while still putting interesting twists on old (and new) songs, and working with legendary country heroes and fresh Nashville faces, this is a treasure of American music. It's inspiring to find a band in their 70's and 80's who aren't afraid of trying something new; and country music is a decidedly welcome and seemingly perfect change.Opening up with the title track, backed by the Oak Ridge Boys, \"Take The High Road\" is a sonic blast of hope and joy. It really sets the pace for the entire record: optimism, salvation, faith.Co-producer Jamey Johnson's sweet baritone voice supports the old-timey hymn \"Have Thine Own Way Lord\". The song evokes another world in another time. You feel like you've found yourself in some cozy 1970's church deep in the American South; Johnson summoning the voice of country greats while the Blind Boys pray along as the church choir.The iconic Willie Nelson with his superstar mouth harp player in tow, Mickey Raphael lace \"Family Bible\" with some real musical magic, as to be expected. The Blind Boys echo \"rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me\"--their reverent response serves as the song's chorus.No matter what genre they're experimenting with, the Blind Boys are never afraid to get funky, and songs like \"Jesus Built A Bridge To Heaven\", \"Why Don't You Live So God Can Use You\", and \"Jesus, Hold My Hand\" are indelible evidence.The sweet soul-soaked voice of Blind Boy Ben Moore carries through the solemn prayer \"I Know A Place\". Moore affirms his rock-solid faith as he gracefully utters \"I know, I know, I know, I know for certain...\"The ballads aren't the only shining numbers here, Hank Williams, Jr. leads these septu- and octogenarians through a borderline punk rock version of his father's legendary \"I Saw The Light\".\"Take The High Road\" is an impressive collection of county-gospel tracks that harken back to a time when bands put the music first. And because of this, I know for certain \"High Road\" will stand up with the best of them for decades to come.\n", "val": 0.05266203358769417}

{"text": "This is a well crafted CD release by the legendary hard rock band Warrant, titled 'Rockaholic'. While many hard rock bands that started with them in the 80s may have disappeared, Warrant is still going strong despite line-up changes & delivers well in this new CD (14 tracks). The songs are well balanced (mixture of mid-tempo tracks & ballads), good compositions & well produced. Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \"Innocence Gone\" (beautiful very commanding vocals & melodic guitars), \"Home\" (a wonderful ballad, inspirational lyrics, very melodical sound & vocals), \"Life's A Song\" (mid-tempo track with a build-up to a beautiful cresendo, great melody & vocals), \"Found Forever\" (a wonderful ballad with great melody & chorus) & \"Tears In The City\" (another ballad with incredible melody, harmonies & vocals). CD filler/okay track for me is \"Candy Man\". Great tracks include \"Sex Ain't Love\" (mid-tempo track, great melody & vocals), \"Snake\", \"Dusty's Revenge\" (melodical guitars), \"What Love Can Do\", \"Show Must Go On\", \"Cocaine Freight Train, \"Sunshine\" & \"The Last Straw\". The band Warrant in this CD 'Rockaholic' covers the usual hard rock subjects of love/sex, drugs & having great fun. The band is certainly still going strong, their fans should be delighted with this well crafted CD release, a highly recommended CD listening.\n", "val": 0.06121467426419258}

{"text": "Warrants eighth album, Rockaholic is just another piece of hard rock heavily influenced by the likes of Guns N Roses, AC-DC, The Scorpions, and Poison. So just so were clear, there is basically no innovation present on this 2012 release. But even if it sounds like youve heard some of these songs before, their sheer live energy, contagious hooks, memorable vocal patterns, and inspiring guitar leads are plentiful enough to outweigh anything negative or lackluster.The album opens with Sex Aint Love, a really simple yet equally as catchy and infectious number with a Brian Johnson-style shout-worthy chorus. The next couple of cuts, the wailing Innocence Gone and Snake, are both highlighted by ripping, borderline wailing, and positively air-guitar-able solos. And Dustys Revenge is crunchy and confrontational, despite beginning with an acoustic guitar. But it is then, around the mid-section, that the album seems to drag a little bit, thanks to the inclusion of the mostly-acoustic Home, What Love Can Do, and the almost completely unremarkable Lifes A Song. But even these songs have some merit, as they all feature memorably soaring vocals/lyrics, grumbling bass, and well-placed cymbal crashes. And despite these three less-than-thrilling and/or irresistible moments, the energy that the band captures in up-tempo hard rockers like Show Must Go On compensates for any sub-superb songs, and does so by being a vibrant and bouncy anthem with more good guitar solo work and wailing vocals.And fear not because the album concludes on a strong note, with Cocaine Freight Train being an up-tempo and energetic chugger with industrial-strength guitar hooks, (what sounds like) a wailing harmonica run, and catchy, and even borderline anthemic choruses. A little bit of whammy-bar-soaked guitar work is also included, here, and it is also on Candy Man, which follows up the unremarkable Found Forever in fashion by being a whammy bar/wah pedal-worshipping hard rocker. Next we have Sunshine, a bass-driven rawker with fat, grumbling bass lines, solid guitar licks, a catchy main groove, and some wah-drenched soloing. And then, following Tears In The City, a somber acoustic ballad, Warrant storm back as hungrily as ever with The Last Straw, which is a briskly chugging metal song, thus making it quite possibly the albums heaviest and most aggressive moment.Rockaholic might be a pretty inconsistent and less-than-amazing effort with a handful of forgettable songs. But, on the whole, it is a very decent (and certainly, consistently listenable) affair from a band that has routinely kicked out effort after eminently enjoyable effort for the past twenty-four-plus years. As such, Warrant definitely and once again, uh, warrant a listen from all serious hard rock and heavy metal aficionados.\n", "val": 0.010143797844648361}

I was a little scepticle to listen to them after Jani died. I hate a frontman who tries to immitate and take the place of the original singer.

Robert Mason has a great voice there is no doubt about it, he's actually better than Jani Lane (vocally) but he's different, has a different style, a little more laid back on some of the songs, others are fast and furious. Jani was out to prove something, and the songs were heavier, I loved Warrant albums with Jani. But put aside the expectation of Jani Lane's voice. With that said: can't possibly rate this album anything less than 3 stars even if you were not into Warrant in the past. Robert Mason makes the album, he wrote most of lyrics for the songs (and they are good) and quite a few of the songs (music). He hits some nice highs. You can tell he takes the band into a slightly different style and direction. If you allow that to happen then you'll love the album.

{"text": "2.5 starsWarrant is back with their seventh studio album, their second to feature the original lineup, sans singer Jani Lane. The band's new singer is Robert Mason, replacing Black N' Blue singer Jamie St. James, who sang on 2006's \"Born Again.\"Warrant is a guilty pleasure of mine. The band might have written some cheesy songs that sounded dated very shortly after their release, as they fell into obscurity in the 90s, but they had a gifted songwriter in original singer Jani Lane. Songs like \"Cherry Pie\" and \"Down Boys,\" as corn-ball as they might be, were a cut above most of the butt-rock sludge that was being churned out in the late 80s and early 90s. His songs sometimes even had a touch of melancholy, which gave Warrant a genuine sense humanity, something that bands like Winger or Slaughter lacked.It was Jani Lane that made Warrant an above-average band in the first place, so without his presence, how do Warrant sound? This question was first answered with \"Born Again,\" which wasn't bad. It sounded more like Black N' Blue than Warrant, but it was a good record. It's a shame that that lineup didn't continue. \"Rockaholic,\" while not bad, isn't as good. The band and the production sound good, but the songs are sort of just by-the-numbers 80s rockers and ballads. Mason is a competent singer, but nothing special. The lyrics, which are nothing but cliches about getting laid and heart-break, don't help much.Warrant are smart enough to know that they aren't going to sell more records by trying to sound relevant, so they wisely stick to making an album that old-school Warrant fans might dig. The problem is that there isn't anything all that memorable. Still, if you like 80s pop-metal, \"Rockaholic\" might be worth checking out.\n", "val": 0.0015501623274758458}

{"text": "\"Rockaholic\" is the brand new seventh studio album by American glam metal band \"Warrant\". Five years past their previous album \"Born Again\", the established line up of Joey Allen (g), Jerry Dixon (b), Eric Turner (g) and Steven Sweet (d) introduce new front man Robert Mason. This line up has been performing live since 2008 at which point most fans were anticipating a new studio album.\"Rockaholic\" is a return to the established \"Warrant\" sound; catchy grooves, thick guitars, large and often naughty, choruses all of which create an undeniable party atmosphere. The blues/rock'n roll influence is traceable on the majority of the songs still the band extend their musical style writing rock ballads such as \"Home\" and \"Cocaine freight train\" as well as AOR tunes like \"What love can do\" and \"Tears in the city\". At this point one has to comment that Mason holds nothing back on this album and sure enough he delivers song after song.With 14 tracks on offer, \"Rockaholic\" is amongst the lengthiest albums in the band's catalogue as well as being a high quality hard rock release; one could theorise that the previous years of live performances and testing the line up on the road has possibly affected the end result being pretty diverse yet totally \"Warrant\".

{"text": "After quite an absence on the hard rock/metal scene Warrant original members Erik Turner (guitar), Jerry Dixon (bass), Joey Allen (guitar) and Steven Sweet (drums) have returned with a new album Rockaholic and a new front man in Robert Mason.  With a new front man there are always going to be the inevitable comparisons to original singer Jani Lane, especially given that his voice was an integral part of the Warrant sound.  In my opinion Mason doesn't sound too bad at all actually, but doesn't seem to have the ability to get the higher register that Jani Lane was capable of.  With that in mind Warrant have carefully written their new songs around Masons' ability, while still trying to maintain some degree of that classic Warrant sound for the fans.The opening song Sex Ain't Love is a ripper, sounding very much like a sleazy Motley Crue type rocking tune, and is a great one to open the album with.  It's followed by Innocence Gone which I like even more with a real rock `n' roll vibe and good chorus.  Both these songs have more in common with stuff from D.R.F.S.R. and Cherry Pie than their later albums, and actually sound like they could have come straight from L.A.'s Sunset Strip in the 80's.  They hark back to a style of music that just really hasn't been played like this for quite a good many years and I love it.  Unfortunately the rest of the album just doesn't reach the same glorious heights.I also quite like the album closer The Last Straw which is a faster paced hard rockin' song, track 4 Dusty's Revenge with its cowboy hard rock sound, and the more commercial sounding track 7 Life's A Song which in the chorus sounds more like the classic Warrant sound than anything else on the album.  Unfortunately though the album is just too long at 14 songs, with those that I haven't mentioned being just average songs and a couple of clunkers in Cocaine Freight Train and the lame ballad Home, the likes of which we've just heard too many times before by so many hard rock/metal bands by now. There are a couple of songs towards the end of the album in Sunshine and Tears In The City which sound more like the Dog Eat Dog and Ultraphobic era Warrant (both albums I like quite a lot), of which the latter isn't too bad at all and would be my pick as the best of the rest of the album.On this album Warrant have done a good job in retaining a degree of their classic sound which leans more towards that of their more successful earlier albums, so there is much to like.  But despite Robert Mason being a good singer, I just can't help but think how much better these songs would have sounded with Jani Lane singing them.  What a shame he completely lost the plot because he was both a very talented singer and songwriter which despite their best efforts, Warrant still really miss.  There is some good stuff on this album but it should have been a couple of songs shorter.  There is just too much filler to make it a great album rather than just a good one.\n", "val": 0.0014317529276013374}
{"text": "After loving most of the tracks from the last Warrant album, \"Born Again (2006)\" I was stunned that on that album the band had (and thankfully) gone back to playing hard rock music then that dumb idea they had to go in a grunge direction... the new warrant sound amazed me that it sounded so great, a bit of AC/DC rawness and a few newer sounds to make it great for both new and old rockers. However, on this album, there seems to be little of that new spark they had on the previous album, it seems to have gone much softer, yet somehow 80's metal. So, with that said, keep in mind, I did like the last album, and I am not one of those fans who say this band is not the same without Jani Lane, because Jaime St. James may not have had the vocal range of Jani, but for that album, I think he did a fantastic job... but with that said, St. James has parted ways with the band and Robert Mason has stepped up to the mic to try and fill some rather big shoes.But quite frankly, I was not very impressed with his vocals, nor the lyrics to this entire album.It seems that the same song has been recorded 3 or 4 times on this album, mostly they where a balled, but it just seemed, like the rock music of this album is very generic. I'm not saying the music is bad, I'm just saying that everything seemed to sound like something you had either heard before, or it just sounded like standard way of recording something you can stand from start to finish, while not being memorable. I found nothing here that stands out above everything else.When I first heard \"Born Again\" there where riffs and lyrics I liked from the very first moment I heard it, but on this album, I think I heard one thing that sounded a little creative, and all that was, was two guitars playing scales together, but the band seemed to be jamming away rather nicely, but even now when I try to remember what track that was, and after a few listens, it's just not standing out as something more then \"it's the best track on this album\" (which isn't much) rather then \"that's an incredible unforgettable song\" if you know what I mean?It sounded to me a lot of the time like Aerosmith fillers... it sounds like Aerosmith, but just not a hit song or a fan favorite sort of thing, if you follow what I am saying about this album... it surely isn't a bad album, but then again, it's far from ever going to be great, nor get any attention. I can't see any of these songs being played on the radio in future as some sort of \"classic\" that anyone will remember anything from this album, and I certainly did not hear anything here that someone could convince me would be welcomed into the listings of Warrants greatest hits. By the looks of things, it looks like the band is pushing for \"Life's a Song\" to become a hit single, but I really don't think it's good enough, especially when Warrant have created just such a thing in the past.I was really disappointed that \"Born Again\" didn't do much better for this band then it did, but this album here, I can fully understand why it will not chart, be memorable to really anyone but die-hard warrant fans, and I definitely can't see this album generating new fans or welcoming back forgotten fans to take an interest in this band again.The overall sound of this album doesn't sound like it's something new, it sounds rather 80's metal... which I am not saying is a bad thing, I do love 80's metal, however I just could not help but compare them to Warrants 80's metal hits, and they just don't feel like they should be standing side by side against any of them. There was only a couple of times I heard that hint of the sound the band had on the last album, but for the most part, the songs here felt very empty, and no attitude or emotion was felt, neither love or hate. There was no great musical direction, great lyric writing, a melody that stood out, there just was not really much at all in the way of anything being memorable. There might have been 2 songs on here I thought where OK, but like I said, far from their best efforts, and very far from anything to be considered part of the greatest hits.I'm sorry to say this, especially since Warrant is one of my all time favorite bands, but this album has been a disappointing 5 year wait. I'm not sure if I would go as far and say this band need a new singer, because I am not too sure who wrote what in the lyrics department for this one, but if it was Robert Mason handling most of the lyric writing for this album, then the rest of the band should really try seeking other more creative writers to help with the lyric writing side of Warrant, because the ones here just seemed to keep repeating themselves, there was nothing at all special about them, and the phrase \"I love you\" was used way too many times overall. I kept rolling my eyes when hearing it, and thinking, \"Why bother to try and compete with 'Heaven'\"? If you have a masterpeice, why try to paint it again, especially trying to paint it this time with no colors?Well thats what I thought about this album, but I still have my hopes up that Warrant will bounce back soon with a great tune, great riffs, and great lyrics once again.\n", "val": 6.782773562008515e-05}
{"text": "I'll keep this simple.  It's a good record.  If you're a long time fan of Warrant or new to the band, it's a solid release.  I'm not going to get into Jani vrs Robert (lead singer debate)  I like both!  Most know Jani because of Warrant but Robert (from a few bands but notably Big C*ck! Great Music!) Anywhooo, this release is pretty good, they mix it up well like Warrant has on prior records.  I like Born Again, a bit better, but give it time and this might change as (1day after Rockaholic's release) it's too early to really make a fair assessment.  I might update this, I might not.  But for $10 ($9on-a-DgtlDwnld) it's currently good enough to listen too, until I learn all the words (oh yeah, there are no lyrics printed typical Warrant-WTF)! Well on-you-go get your order on become a Rockaholic!May 24th, 2011Ok...update time!  100% Better than Ultraphobic!  I hate to say it, but Jani is so 80's and Robert is so 80's plus 10! As in Crank it to 10!  Like Junkyard(the band) said...\"Put it on 10 and pull the knobs off!\"  This record is starting \"Kiss Yer @$$ in every way\" (go ahead buy it find out what song here-in contain those lyrics!) Straightup R to the OCK!  To many people get hung up on the LEAD SINGER, as most people don't actually listen to the whole package.  This record has the riffy guitars, the blues & the grunge guitars, as well as the melodic guitars (wa-wa stuff as I call it) Robert's voice is SOLID and carries!  Take WARRANT (the \"BAND\" name) outta the equation, and this record deserves to be in every True Rock Fans arsenal!Song inventory:I like the following enough to create playlists and add them to mix's: 1-Sex Ain't Love (great driving to the bar song...hope you find what yer looking) 2-Innocnece Gone (great song for the young summer type heading to the beach looking for love) 3-Snake ( (s)he who cheats can relate) 4-Dusty's Revenge (Bluesy/Country vibe but heavy and grungy guitars...Gods speed) 5-Home (slow song to play yer girl if just got into a fight...Man you were wrong) 6-What Love Can Do (contemporary type song that could be played on the radio, kinda Def Leppardy) 7-Life's A Song (definately a growup and reflect song, check out the video utube it!)-cheesy? maybe but solid 8-Show Must Go On (totally break out the fith and put yer fav record on then crank it to 10 and drink!)Dr. RX 9-Cocaine Freight Train (SEX...\"Honey yer like Cocaine, when I'm on you I want More, More, More!\") says it all!10-Found Forever (slow song) every record needs one, total Ballad!  Gotta Love'em11-Candy Man (here come the wa-wa's....\"You can make the pain go away\") I want more....12-Sunshine (Melodic, good mix of guitars)13-Tears In The City (another ballad type...I've heard better)14-The Last Straw (Great fast ending makes you wanna hit 'replay cd' def'n'tly an early 80's vibe)So there you have it!  Well worth the $9.99 (A bit under-priced in my opinion)  No...On-you-go!  BUY IT!\n", "val": 0.009420839138329029}

{"text": "I've been a big fan of Richard's since the late 80's & I had no idea that he had a new album coming out until I stumbled across it at my local Wal-Mart the other night.  What a nice surprise!  I've been waiting for Richard to release an album of acoustic covers of his hits for awhile now.  Especially after I saw him & Kenny Loggins performing their hits live in acoustic on the PBS series&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Legends-Lyrics-Vol-2/dp/B0027AV690/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Legends & Lyrics Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;awhile back. That was a fantastic concert but left me wanting more.  Alot more.  Well this new album did just that very thing & it is well worth getting your hands on.First off there's a dvd that shows Marx performing live in London recently & it's a great performance.  Richard went solo on this tour & plays acoustic guitar throughout the show but he is eventually joined by a small group of violin players. He also talks about the songs a little bit which is always nice.There's also 2 cd's. The first cd features acoustic versions of mostly well known hits & also a few lesser known, but nice, ballads. On the 2nd cd, Marx & his band go back to electrical instruments & do slightly alternate versions of the hits. I'm usually not a fan of alternate versions, remixes, etc. cuz i've always believed if it ain't broke, why fix it?  But in this case, Marx doesn't stray too far from the original sound & does real justice to these new versions. Some of the songs like \"Right Here Waiting\" are almost indistinguishable from the originals but others like \"Satisfied\" are more stripped down & sound noticably different.  But there are no clunkers here & most of them are excellent songs.Most importantly though, Richard's voice is just as youthful & soulful as it was back in his earlier days & he can still hit those high notes just like he did when he was sporting that long, thick mullet he had back in the 80's.  And that's pretty impressive considering that he's pushing 50 & tours regularly.Anyway, you can't go wrong with this set. Especially if you're a fan of Marx's greatest hits or the Unplugged concerts that were really popular back in the early 90's.P.S.  If you'd like to hear some more great acoustic songs by Marx, checkout his collaboration with Matt Scanell (Vertical Horizon) on the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Duo/dp/B004IWG8WK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Duo</a>.

I repeat: they have been tweaked SLIGHTLY.The second audio disc titled \"Stories To Tell\" is the acoustic and unplugged audio versions of selected songs from his recent tour, while the accompanying concert DVD \"Live at Shepherd's Bush\" is, of course the video presentation of his concert.  However, some of the titles like \"Take This Heart,\" \"When You're Gone,\" \"Through My Veins,\" \"Always On Your Mind,\" \"Everybody,\" and \"Don't Mean Nothing\" appear on the DVD video, but do not appear on the \"Stories To Tell\" audio CD.  In opposite fashion, the songs \"Over My Head,\" \"Now and Forever,\" \"Keep Coming Back,\" \"This I Promise You,\" \"Loved,\" and \"When You Loved Me\" appear on the \"Stories To Tell\" Audio CD, but do not appear on the DVD video.  Richard Marx, who also produced this entire 2 CD/1 DVD collection, obviously wanted to mix things up a bit with the final product, and include as much variety as possible.For anyone who is a devout fan (like my wife) of Richard Marx, this set is a wonderful must-have.  As Marx turns 50 years old in 2013, he is still an incredibly strong talent on stage.  In fact, I took my wife to see Richard in Burnsville, Minnesota in October 2010, and we would go again to see him perform in a heartbeat.  This 2 CD/1 DVD set is a wonderful reminder and souvenir of that concert experience!  Highly recommended!\n", "val": 0.01047159731388092}

Matthew 24:36 Nevertheless, to attack a fundamental doctrine of the faith is not only foolish, it betrays a serious lack of the fear of God (Proverbs 1:7), and a disregard for His inspired word. 2 Timothy 3:16  Perhaps, Eliza could use a little serious study of the doctrine of verbal, plenary, inspiration.\n", "val": 3.447654307819903e-05}

Okay track is \"Slouching Towards Betlehem\" : folk/rock/countryish sound.

Unfortunately,though the correct CD is inside the case and the booklet displays the correct cover artwork, the booklet is missing the liner notes and the track listing is incorrect both in the booklet and on the CD tray.(It's from some classical music CD with multipart movements and no composer listed). As there is no listing of the tracks on the CD itself, there is no information as to what is actually on the CD (unless you happen to be familiar with the original vinyl copy). One unfamiliar with this album would recognize the songs but wouldn't know which song is on which track while those familiar with the music would think the wrong CD was sent based on the incorrect track listing and may hesitate to open the CD.

She really just exists in this song to deliver the lyrics, which she does well. What really makes this song so good is the meaty backbone of a beat. I'm unsure why Jennifer's handlers would choose 'I'm Into You' over this as the next single, but this should definitely be the choice for third single. This is likely what 'On the Floor' could have sounded like given a bit more time and no Pitbull.'Love?' may not be a solid choice for an album, but it seems to have a few gems buried on it.

{"text": "Karrin Allyson possesses a tremendous genius for playing piano, keyboard and singing; indeed, there's not a bad track in the lot here and that's grand. Karrin's voice is in excellent form throughout the album; her sense of timing along with creative arrangements make this album very special. Moreover, we are treated throughout the album to beautiful solos by musicians including Ed Howard playing bass (on \"'Round Midnight\") and Randy Weinstein on harmonica (for \"Smile\"). The quality of the sound is excellent and there are liner notes by the artist herself.\"Turn Out the Stars\" begins the album with Karrin singing faultlessly; she also plays with the tempo to put her own mark on this wonderful ballad. Paul Simon's \"April Come She Will,\" is very well done; I really like that arrangement! \"Goodbye\" is another melancholy tune that Karrin aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing--but of course we know it really wasn't all that easy; Karrin's talent carries her through every time. Of course, the same can be said of all the other artists playing instruments on this CD. Moreover, \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" gets a most sensitive treatment from Karrin who performs this to perfection--and beyond!\"Spring Can Really Hang You up The Most\" is extra special when Karrin sings it so well; and \"Smile\" which was partly written by Charles Chaplin couldn't have been done any better. \"Sophisticated Lady\" is another excellent song; and \"There's No Such Thing as Love\" impresses me quite a bit. \"The Shadow of Your Smile\" is easily one of my very favorite tracks on the album; Karrin and the others really make these numbers take flight! I could never tire of hearing music like this. \"Send in the Clowns\" by Stephen Sondheim gets a particularly sensitive treatment and the album ends with Thelonious Monk's \"'Round Midnight.\" It leaves me wanting more from Karrin and the others.\"'Round Midnight\" is a must-have for any fan of Karrin Allyson; these songs showcase her extraordinary talent and leave nothing to be desired. In addition, people just noticing Karrin's incredible artistry would do well to get this as a starter CD.\n", "val": 0.0383724682033062}
{"text": "There are some singers I've given up on, meaning those who will never make a recording as good as their talent suggests.  There are others I will never give up on, meaning those who never coast, always explore, always stimulate.Then there is Karrin Allyson.  I find that her output has been widely variable; but when she hits it, it goes 500 feet out of the park.  I'm talking about 2001's  \"Ballads\" and 2006's \"Footprints,\" both superb and of the best recordings of those years.This one struck me as a triple; but on repeated listenings, I would say more like an inside-the-park home run.  Meaning not as flashy as the other two, yet somehow sweeter.Ms. Allyson has one of the most melancholy of all singing voices. So, an ideal project for her is tunes about heartbreak, about sadness, about turning out the stars, about spring hanging you up, about smiling while your heart is breaking, about losing it late in your career, about the depression that sets in about midnight.  That is, she got the gestalt for this album exactly right.And knowing what she wanted, self-production was a good idea.  I love \"Smile,\" with her self-accompaniment on piano (and if you didn't know what a good pianist she is, that makes two of us!).  I love \"'Round Midnight,\" with only Ed Howard's bass accompanying her and painting the picture of the minimalist story.  I love Randy Weinstein's harmonica on \"Smile\" and the great Bob Sheppard's flute on \"The Shadow of Your Smile,\" as well as his tenor solo on \"Turn Out the Stars.\"  Rod Fleeman nails it throughout on guitar, particularly on \"April Come She Will.\"Perhaps the biggest kudos belong to Ms. Allyson as producer, along with Nick Phillips.  This is one of the least-cluttered sounding recordings out there; and for the creative idea, that is absolutely the direction it needed to go.I noticed in her last recording that Ms. Allyson seemed to be losing the lower part of her singing range.  Thankfully, most of it returned for this recording.  She still is missing the lowest part of her range; but for a jazz singer creating melancholy about missed opportunities and lost loves, that doesn't get in the way at all here.I hope Karrin Allyson will knock out another great recording sooner than five years from now.  But as it is, she's worth the wait.  RC\n", "val": 0.0020167261827737093}

The arrangements suited Karrin's voice and style perfectly.

{"text": "[excerpted from Vocalstandards.com review]'Round Midnight is both the best time to listen to Karrin's latest album -- a collection of  jazz styled torch songs -- and also the place she transports you to ... the atmospheric that envelops you in the listening.Think ... late night -- early morning really -- in a darkened, intimate \"joint\" of a jazz club.Two or three shadowy patrons nursing drinks around pools of light from table lamps ... islands in a black sea washing up to the small stage. A lonely blue spot casting sharp shadows on a trio ... or maybe just a woman at the piano playing tortuous ballads.Mournful and sweet, soul wrenching stuff that has you wondering how someone can sing so beautifully about such heartache.OK, enough with the \"dark and stormy night\" crap...I think you get the picture. This is a concept album in the Sinatra tradition, with the stated goal of delivering you to that \"wee small hours\" melancholic milieu, and Karrin pulls it off quite well ... maybe even too well, but we'll touch on that later.Karrin popped into view for me a few months back during one of those ambient radio listening afternoons. VocalStandards.com accounting or some other sort of mindless work at hand ... the radio washing over me with a constant flow of standards when all of a sudden a wistful voice I've not heard before knocks me out of my rote labor malaise.It was Allyson singing Johnny Mandel's \"Shadow of Your Smile\" with a wildly cool alto flute obbligato ... I was hooked and had to find more.'Round Midnight is indeed more...I love good theme albums ... especially those that cut a different path through the material and actually go deeper than just gathering a passel of like songs. When I look back I notice than many of my reviews seem to gravitate to concept work ... Sammy Davis, Steve Tyrell, Mr. Sinatra and maybe most aligned to my interest in KA's 'Round Midnight LP ... Julie London.The torch song fest that Allyson assembles on this well produced Concord Records LP certainly blazes a fresh trail through the saloon ballad genre.'Round Midnight is comprised of both traditional numbers -- native to the love-lost ballads wing of the American Songbook -- and nontraditional fare.A couple of numbers from a more upbeat neighborhood are successfully re-visioned here. Down tempo arrangements and laconic vocals are interleaved with sinuous sax, guitar and even harmonica soli.Karrin's smoke edged jazz vocal style dances in and around the solos ... backed by lean but well balanced rhythm charts. Allyson's style approaches the blues but backs away at the last minute and remains in a jazz tinged and sultry ballad standards motif.Though she claims Carmen McRae as her hero in the liner notes, I hear more tonal shades of Rosemary Clooney on some numbers and echoes of Julie London on others. All to great effect ... there's no sense of mimicry. Karrin's vocal style is distinctive -- a jazz original.I must be a traditionalist...All the songs on this album are well done (full track list and ratings below) but my favorite songs off 'Round Midnight are standards classics.I've already mentioned being drawn to \"Shadow of Your Smile\" ... Allyson's excellent song selection continues with great renditions of Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Lady\", the title track \"'Round Midnight\", Stephen Sondheim's \"Send In The Clowns\" (Sinatra's signature \"break-up\" number), and Mel Torm's \"Born To Be Blue\".KA arranged the Torm number and six other songs on the album. Two other favorites from the Allyson arrangement array are the classic Gordon Jenkins number \"Goodbye\" ... wonderfully balanced instrumental backing with an awesome guitar bridge from Rod Fleeman, and \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" is pleasantly highlighted by Bob Sheppard's sax.Melancholy-O-Plenty...I love Paul Simon, but his song -- \"April Come She Will\" -- doesn't work for me on this concept album. A very nice version but to my ear, \"April...\" is stuck in Simon's native pop/folk realm and doesn't seem to make the traverse to an intimate club torch ballad. Probably just me.Otherwise I really enjoy all the songs on this album. Taken as individual numbers these are beautifully rendered and emotive, heartfelt ballads. Weaving these numbers into a playlist so that you occasion them every so often makes them special -- dark, ruby colored torch song gems.But taken back-to-back, in the aggregate this is a lot of down tempo material (approaching a dirge at times) ... playing the album straight through more than once or twice wears down my psyche. It's really not fair for me to hammer Karrin for this -- 'Round Midnight is a concept album after all -- with mournful ballads being the target of that theme.As such, I'm not wielding a critical hammer here -- just calling out how I like to listen to Karrin's excellent 'Round Midnight material ... and that is woven into a balanced playlist so that these wonderfully interpreted songs stand apart when encountered.If you're a torch song aficionado like me ... or you just want to be transported to that dark jazz club late in the evening for a drink and to listen to some great music that will make you remember ... and help you forget, then this is an LP you should pick up.'Round Midnight - Karrin Allyson Track Listing(VS_Guy ratings: \"+++\" pluses are good; \"~\" for meh to middling;  \"- - -\" minuses are not good)* Arranged by Karrin Allyson1.

{"text": "\"Each of these songs holds great meaning for me--as I hope they do or will for you.\" ~ Karrin Allyson ~Before turning in last Saturday night, I adjusted my clocks and watches one hour forward for Daylight Saving Time. To me, it is a reminder that Spring is just around the corner. It is a favorite season for many, including myself, but sometimes...and yes, \"Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most.\" Karrin Allyson's impressive delivery of this 1955 standard by Fran Landesman and Tommy Wolf is one of the best so far. This is one of the many tracks that she plays the ivories with the backing of her band mates Rod Fleeman (electric guitar), Ed Howard (bass) and Matt Wilson (drums).\"'Round Midnight,\" was nominated for \"Best Vocal Jazz Album\" in 2012 Grammy Awards. There's no doubt that this is one of the best jazz albums released in 2011. Apart from this one, I have three other albums of hers:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ballads-Remembering-John-Coltrane/dp/B00005J716/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ballads: Remembering John Coltrane</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/From-Paris-to-Rio/dp/B00000JRKL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">From Paris to Rio</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Imagina-Songs-of-Brasil/dp/B0013F3YFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Imagina: Songs of Brasil</a>. I have the same degree of appreciation for \"'Round Midnight\" and the amazing tribute album to John Coltrane.How could a recording such as this with sparse instrumentation sound so beautiful? All it takes are Karrin Allyson's fine vocals, remarkable technique in piano, arranging skills; Ron Fleeman's mastery in guitar; Matt Wilson's striking drums; Bob Sheppard's multi-talents in tenor/soprano saxophone, alto flute, bass clarinet plus Randy Weinstein's splendid harmonica to make this album stand out and worthy to any jazz lover's music collection. The instrumentations are exceptional particularly the soulful solos on \"Sophisticated Lady\" and \"Smile\"(harmonica), \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" (soprano sax), \"The Shadow Of Your Smile\" (alto flute) and \"Goodbye\" (guitar).If there's a lady-singer counterpart of Frank Sinatra when it comes to concept albums such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Frank-Sinatra-Sings-for-Only-the-Lonely/dp/B000006OHF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Where-Are-You/dp/B000TENG26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Where Are You?</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/In-the-Wee-Small-Hours/dp/B000006OHD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">In the Wee Small Hours</a>, it would certainly be Karrin Allyson in her most emotional renditions of the songs in this bluesy album. Like Frank Sinatra, she can pull it off effortlessly in a manner that listeners are moved and affected. She is an effective singer who can completely convey the melancholy message of each song through her expressive voice. And that to me is an acid test of a real singer--to be able to touch the musical sensitivity of the listeners like she does in her heartfelt readings of \"The Shadow of Your Smile,\" \"Sophisticated Lady,\" \"Smile,\" \"Goodbye\" and the title track featuring the terrific bass work of Ed Howard.

The only time I know of Keith Murray and Cannibus working together was on LL Cool J's \"Who shot ya\", but they seem to have real chemistry (like Red and Meth) working together.The beats and music are not the most original, but their flow on top of it makes it a real pleasant surprise!\n", "val": 0.03345615044236183}
{"text": "This album could have been great.  I love the production.  Canibus kills every verse.  The downfall?... Keith Murray!  I felt the same way about the EP, and now I feel even more strongly about it after listening to this full length album.  This is just not a good pairing.  Canibus carrys the whole album while Keith Murray tries his best to drag it down.  Canibus is a phenominal lyricist.  Keith Murray is on an elementry school level with his rhymes.  And the two MCs just don't mesh well together.  A Bis verse and a Murray verse are like polar opposites on the same track.  If this was a Canibus solo, it would be amazing.  Or being a collabo, I wish it was with a more capable MC.  I really like the production.  The beats are good and audio quality good, and Bis' vocal quality is great (these are all aspects that are sometimes lacking with Canibus' albums).  This is why I'm frustrated with this album.  It could be so much better than it is.  A must have for a Canibus fan.  And I suppose for a Keith Murray fan also.  There are also a handful of good guest features.  I hope Bis doesnt do another album with Murray.\n", "val": 5.0423659558873624e-05}

Anytime Canibus is involved the expectation is that the lyrics would be great so I anticipated a pretty decent album but I was definitely surprised by the stellar production 'In Gods We Trust' received.

A dope album that should definitely be regarded as one of the best works this year.\n", "val": 0.04616222530603409}
{"text": "This album in my opinion is a must have for anyone that enjoys listening to real hip-hop at its best.  I have no problem giving this a 5/5 stars and actually after I got this album, I haven't really been listening to anything else unlike before when I had to change CDs constantly which isn't necessarily a terrible thing.  Lately, Royce da 5'9 claimed that there's been a vast decline in Canibus' rhyming ability compared to when he started however a lot of Canibus fans who purchased the C of tranquillity album totally disagreed with the statement. Canibus definitely proves again on this album that he is far from being over. Both Canibus and Keith Murray kept going hard throughout the entire album even though Canibus seemed to outshine Keith Murray on many of the songs same way he outshined a lot of great emcees he recorded with in the past.  However, the only thing I dislike about this album is the very little attention it's getting because there is absolutely nothing negative I can say about the album itself which is why I believe it deserves a lot of credit.  This is not the type of album you come by everyday, not even from some of the finest emcees you've ever listened to if I have to be honest. The lyrics on the album => insane, Flow => intense, Consistency => 5/5 star and if you're in a hunt for Hardcore hip hop albums, look here first.\n", "val": 0.0015979023883119226}

{"text": "I remember, years ago, when I first heard 'Your Hand in Mine' by Explosions in the Sky. I was moved, stunned, and had instantly fallen in love with a style of music that I had not heard of prior to my experience with that track. Since then, about five years later, post-rock has become the basis for a wide-array of my listening. Whether it be Slint, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Yndi Halda, or Russian Circles, I've grown to love post-rock. However, as time has gone on, I've branched out in my listening, growing increasingly fond of neoclassical styles, avant-garde, ambient, and drone. I have started to notice that a large, and somewhat overwhelming, number of post-rock groups rely on the same soft-loud-really loud-soft song structure. It has been slowly getting old, to be honest.Then there is This Will Destroy You. They started off with their lovely 'Young Mountain'. An album whose concepts were generally synonymous with those of Explosion in the Sky. Despite this, stylistically, it was an uplifting little album, filled with subtle electronic influences and the occasional ambient section. These small things garnered the effort some notable originality. However, had This Will Destroy You continued down the post-rock path, they may very well have hit the creative roadblock that so many post-rock bands seem to be hitting- they may have remained in a rut.So, they wrote 'Tunnel Blanket'. This album will come as a surprise to many followers of This Will Destroy You, as it will most likely deter casual post-rock listeners. It is full of sweeping noises, swells, and meandering instrumental sections reminiscent of many ambient acts, such as Rachel's, Stars of the Lid, and Deaf Center. This is no longer post-rock, my friends. This Will Destroy You has chosen a smaller path, a road less traveled.Now, to me, this was a welcome innovation. I feel as if This Will Destroy You had matured its styles as I had branched out in my musical tastes. Being enamored with ambient and minimalistic music movements, I was absolutely enthralled that the band took their sound in the direction present upon this release. However, this will not apply to all listeners. To those who are very much content with the common stylistic characteristics of post-rock, 'Tunnel Blanket' may be off putting. Despite this, I urge every fan of the band to listen to this album in its entirety at least once. It may be different, but, it proves to be worth it. The album is one massive texture, one giant movement, one huge wave of sounds. It's not necessarily a release that you can hum to, not one you can replicate on your electric guitar, and it's certainly not one that you will want to show others to introduce them to post-rock. It is more of a subsection of the genre. Think of it as a release for the curious and open-minded, one containing all the sounds that are often left in the background of a post-rock album. It brings to the forefront pounding drums, buried under layers of fuzz and reverb. The guitars are more of an ocean than a singular instrument, as they overtake the surrounding environments with smooth drones. Basically, 'Tunnel Blanket' is the abstraction of post-rock. It takes all that the genre entails, and rips it down to its very core base. It does not require catchy riffs and hooks to hold its own. There is melody, but it is often extremely subtle and requires a great amount of attentiveness to pick up.In summary, this is not a typical post-rock album. It really is not post-rock at all, to be honest. This Will Destroy You have paved their own road, releasing an absolutely phenomenal ambient/drone release. If one looks at this album under the guise of a post-rock album, then they will not appreciate it for what it truly is. This is ambient, minimal, music at its finest- perfect for a rainy day or a drive through the mountains.\n", "val": 0.0028287754394114017}
{"text": "I found the sound of this compositions very interesting. At moments it feels like experimental music with white noise as background or with sounds that you try to identify and maybe you are not to convinced you guessed right. If you close your eyes one song (Killed the lord, left for the New World) can even transport you to some lost hamlet in Africa. This is not an album for playing as a background noise but an album to enjoy thinking.\n", "val": 0.010562174953520298}
{"text": "I am completely new to this band, and I have not heard their previous albums. Therefore, I am reviewing this album on its own merits. And it is a great album. I like ambient music, but I mainly like it as passages in longer songs. I typically have a tough time with ambient-only stuff. I feel that this album is almost like a gateway into the ambient world. It's mainly ambient, but changing textures and drums that come in make it very engaging and enjoyable. I can't put my finger on what exactly makes it good, but I often find myself immersed into this album. It may not be for everyone, but I would highly recommend it!\n", "val": 0.02268851175904274}
{"text": "To keep it short and simple, this album is a lot different than their previous releases. Contrary to what other reviews have said, you do not have to endure terrible stuff to enjoy it. I enjoy it for what it is, which isn't necessarily the normal post-rock instrumental that you're probably used to, but still good either way. Listen to it without expectations and you may enjoy it more than if you go into it expecting what you're used to.\n", "val": 0.033497974276542664}
{"text": "You know this album isn't for everyone, what album is.But I love listening to this album completely all the way through. Going from Little Smoke to Powdered Hands is time well spent each time I do it. It's great, it's soundscape, it's NOT like S/T or Quiet but so what?Each song is different but all comes together very well and I love playing games or just driving down the highway listening to it.  If that isn't what music does for you then I don't know what else to tell you.1) Little Smoke - A slow intro but very good and that keyboard part is haunting.  I hum it to myself without realizing it sometimes2) Glass Realms - COMPLETELY soundscape. They just let the feedback carry the song3) Communal Blood - The most similar to Quiet's tracks it moves a lot and centers on the guitar.4) Reprise - Goes back to the haunting sounds of Little Smoke. They're very similar but it's extremely welcome5) Killed the Lord - VERY different from TWDY but it also has a lot of inertia to it so it's not just soundscape.  I think \"movie wrap up song\" when I hear it6) Osario - Effectively an intro to Black Dunes, very short7) Black Dunes - Take the soundscape of Little Smoke and give it some classic TWDY love and you get Black Dunes.  This is one of the best tracks of Tunnel Blanket and it reminds me a lot of \"There Are Some Remedies Worse Than the Disease\"8) Powdered Hands - My favorite track, it really makes the \"tunnel blanket\" of the album come alive with a lecture playing within the soundscape with descriptions of what near death experiences are (inferring the \"tunnels of light\" that are indicative of the title \"tunnel blanket\") it's right about here where you realize just how much it was worth listening to the album all the way through.Awesome album.\n", "val": 0.013625949621200562}
{"text": "The other reviews urge you to power through it regardless of whether you're enjoying it. This should start raising red flags. This isn't medicine, it's music.  Sounds like they forgot to write any music. I'm all for innovation in art, but this is just sounds for the sake of sounds. Sounds like someone was leaning on a keyboard while they were sleeping and accidentally recorded it. Enjoy!\n", "val": 5.987072654534131e-05}
{"text": "If you loved TWDY's epynonymous (2008) or \"Young Mountain\" (2006), as I did, then there's no guarantee that you'll like \"Tunnel Blanket.\"  Those prior albums remain among my favorite and most played post-rock music.  I am still moved by the build-up and climax of \"A Three-Legged Workhorse,\" \"Threads,\" and \"Quiet.\"  Even the more subtle and mellow guitar licks of \"They Move on Tracks of Never-E\" moved me with progressive variation throughout the track.None of these elements that I came to love are present in \"Tunnel Blanket.\"  TWDY has clearly taken Tunnel Blanket in a new direction toward the ambient / drone genres.  Unlike prior albums, the tracks on \"Tunnel Blanket\" generally don't have a distinguishable melody.  No repeating and varying guitar lines.  Instead, TWDY provides an array of tones and sounds that echo and resonate for minutes on end, with the occasional crashing cymbalsAs drone music goes, this is pretty well done.  I appreciate that the band has every right to make whatever music they want.  I also appreciate growth, progress, and experimentation for their own sakes, and I truly hope that many people come to love this album.  Unfortunately for me, it just isn't in any of my preferred genres.If you're a fan of Brian Eno-inspired bands such as Boards of Canada, Stars of the Lid, Hammock, Mono, etc., then this album should be mandatory listening.If you're more into Explosions in the Sky, Caspian, Maybeshewill, Sigur Ros, and Russian Circles, then this album might not speak to you.I imagine that the new material might integrate well with the old material in a live performance.  TWDY is still a great band, and I'd love to see what they do next.  Cheers.\n", "val": 0.0016071461141109467}

I'm hoping they continue their musical studies so that they don't wear our their voices -- Piero in particular has amazing breath control, and the two others are close behind.  Gianluca is really a high baritone and his voice has a distinctly beautifully round sound.  Ignazio's lyrical high notes are excellent.  I've been raving about them to everyone I know and am going to attend two concerts in November -- in Raleigh, NC, and Washington, DC. I haven't thought that much of any singers I can ever remember. I would say to them, as if they need advice -- concentrate on diaphragmatic breathing and you'll have careers of forty or more years -- that's what preserves a voice!  I wish there were a way for more people to hear their singing -- they would be hooked!  The CD and the DVD I obtained through Amazon is certainly excellent -- and arrived the next day.

Nothing \"manufactured\" about them, they've got the goods and they know how to deliver, both on stage and in the studio! Can't wait for their Christmas songs (which they previewed for us), and their next album/CD.

However, they do sing at least 2 in English and 1 in Spanish and I believe 1 in French.  While, other than English, I speak some Spanish, the lack of understanding all the words was not a problem.

It's a privilege to see them so early in their brilliant careers.  When I saw them perform in 2009 on the Italian talent show they were stunning but to hear their voices mature and very different personalities come through is a delight. Pietro got some old school swagger, Gianluca is the classic brooding crooner and Ignazio's smile rarely leaves his face when he sings. I hope that they never lose the joy of singing.  Hearing them makes one think of some divine musical confluence which randomly brought them together. One of the best parts is that they are unaffected, nothing seems stage and they are clearly giddy about a chance to do what they love - sing at the top of their lungs.

These young teens are honestly and genuinely talented, from being on pitch, to natural vibrato, expression, vocal management and breath support. They must have been coached well all their lives because each one has a gem of a voice all their own, yet they harmonize so very well.  I play this music everyday and never tire of it.

When they appeared on stage, I was thinking, please don't suck :) When Gianluca Ginoble started to sing, my jaw dropped!  He sounded so much older and mature than his age dictated to me.  Then Piero Barone started singing his part.  I jumped, his loud tenor scared the crap out of me!  He was beyond incredible!  Then Ignazio Boschetto sang his part.  He was incredible as well!!!  Not too long after that, I purchased their album.  They are trying to bring lyrical pop to the forefront for the young people out there.  I hope that they succeed, because it's not that often you hear this kind of talent coming from guys this young.

{"text": "Terrible cd's. (2) Will not play!While I truly enjoy their songs and voices when I have seen them on tv. I ordered the cd and it will not play on my computer through Itunes.You have sent 2 copies and neither will work. I only ordered one copy but 2 different groups/compaines sent a copy.  This is just another way for you to make money not knowing what the right hand is doing?  There should be a better way of tracking what company has sent what and how many times someting is sent. I know you just know you can make more money and charge me 2 times when I only need one cd.  Which neither of these will work.While there is the statement on the cd (which I have no way of knowing you can't down load it until it arrives) that it is FBI anti-piracy to do unouthrized copy. WHICH I HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING YOU COULDN'T DOWNLOAD BEFORE I PURCHASED. I believe in paying for what I get and I do not consider it illegal to try to play these through my computer. I paid for the cd's but you all have my money but I got nothing. I do most of my shopping from home can't walk very well so don't go out to shop. So not likely to be able to return items either. I would like my money back on both cd's you sent.It is not worth a dime to me since neither will play.  I don't khow how to make it work nor am I willing to spend the time to try to figure it out IF IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.Every other cd I have bought through your company always downloads and works great with the exception of one other. I just gave up on it long ago.IF THERE IS SOME SECRET AS TO HOW TO MAKE IT PLAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS AND AM NOT COMPUTER SAVY ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT THAT PROCESS MIGHT BE... I AM OLD AND EXPECT THINGS TO WORK.IT IS WRONG FOR YOU TO SELL THESE IF THEY WILL NOT WORK. YOU NEED TO TELL THE CUSTOMER THEY CANNOT DOWNLOAD THESE ITEMS BECAUSE IT IS AGAINST THE LAW BEFORE THEY MAKE A PURCHASE. IS THIS THE WAY IT IS GOING TO BE WITH ALL CD'S NOW? WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE REASON IT IS NOT FAIR TO THE PUBLIC IF THEY CANNOT MAKE THEM WORK WHEN THEY ARE PAYING FOR AN ITEM!THESE KIDS ARE MAKING LOTS OF MONEY  AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWING THEIR COMPANY TO DO THIS TYPE OF SELLING TO THE PUBLIC.Thank you,Harriette Sheppard\n", "val": 2.4616045266157016e-05}

{"text": "IL VOLO ('The Flight') is a rather astonishingly gifted trio of teenagers who hit the big time in May of 2009 at an Italian television talent show and now are being guided by Geffen Records to world acclaim. Gianluca Ginoble was born on February 11, 1995 in Roseto degli Abruzzi (province of Teramo), in the Abruzzo region of central Italy; Ignazio Boschetto was born on October 4, 1994 in Agrigento (Sicily), while Piero Barone was born in Sicily on June 24, 1993, but grew up in Bologna (northern Italy). They sing from the heart but with voices that suggest operatic possibilities, IF they are coached and guided at the right pace.  With their current PR and bookings we can only hope that they don't destroy their natural talent by abusing their vocal cords and their egos.  As Geffen Chairman Ron Fair puts it 'Mario Lanza was one of the biggest matinee idols. He was like Elvis, yet singing legit operatic pop. The dark, handsome Italian guy is an iconic part of American culture. And well, here's three.'There are other groups not dissimilar from Il Volo:  Il Divo is a group of four male singers: Spanish baritone Carlos Marn, Swiss tenor Urs Bhler, American tenor David Miller, and French pop singer Sbastien Izambard. To date, they have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide.  And there are individual singers who cross between ballads and opera such as Andrea Bocelli.  But they all started later in life.  The incredible aspect of these three youngsters who don't even appear to be shaving yet is the natural, unforced crooning they produce - crooning is more like serenading a loved one on a balcony than it is a spotlight on a huge arena.  But the boys are sticking for now to favorite Italian songs and some more popular songs from the stage.  Hearing them in person, on a stage, without the benefit of close miking would give us a better idea of the depth of talent that is obviously here.This album was recorded in Los Angeles, Rome and London, gathering some powerful 'backers' along the way.  There is no doubt that what we hear on this recording is beautiful vocalization and interpretation of songs that lean toward serious but are aimed at the hearts of heir audiences.  It will be interesting to see how their careers develop, both as a group and individually.  For now we can just sit back and enjoy the beauty of their singing - and hope that they have engaged wise coaches to make sure they don't burn out too soon.

Diane Warren shouldn't be writing for anyone younger than 40.  I hope that with another album there will be more songs that would appeal to kids the age of these singers.The producers said that when they first heard them sing at 14 and 15 years old they sounded like 45 year old men.  They do have a surprisingly mature quality to their voice.  The producers haven't done a thing in this album to draw the younger audience.  What a shame considering they are so talented, young and good looking.  This group has a life time to perform as 45 year old men but only a few years to capitalize on their youth.

{"text": "John Michael Talbot's Worship and Bow Down recalls 1979's The Lord's Supper. After converting to Catholicism, Talbot released the latter's unique musical adaptation of the Mass, intending for it to be his goodbye to the music world. Instead, its well-received reception launched his new career, following in the spirit of St. Francis as a modern day troubadour for the Lord. His discography is now more than 50 recordings plus a number of books.Worship and Bow Down, which has a CD release date of 6/21/11, but was released as a digital download on Easter day of this year, finds Talbot once again adapting the Mass using the new translation of the Roman Missal into what he calls the \"Mass of Rebirth.\" There are new settings for every element of the Mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Angus Dei, etc.) and for the Hail Mary, the Jesus Prayer and a portion of the Lectio Divina. Many of these songs will be included in the new hymnal published by Oregon Catholic Press (OCP) this fall. Talbot teamed with OCP for this release.\"Hail Mary\" is already one of the new concert favorites and it's not hard to understand why. Talbot sets it in a minor key that adds a beauty and solemnity that is characteristic of a number of compositions found on his recordings. It's moving even if you are not Catholic. Some non-Catholics might object to some of the lyrics, but Talbot is just taking the existing prayer and setting it to music. I have no problem here and on his other recordings overlooking the occasional reference that I might disagree with from a theological standpoint. Such instances are few and far between, which is why Talbot has an appeal beyond Catholic believers. It's worth being able to hear such sacred music.Talbot is truly an artist. He forged his own way, which led him away from the contemporary trend that characterized (and still does) so much of Christian music. He's unlike anyone else and continues to make relevant and meaningful music.One prime example on this release is \"Hind's Feet on High Places,\" a title that many protestants might recognize from the classic book by Hannah Hurnard. This approaches his best work. It starts with a reference to Psalm 91:7 \"A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you\" (ESV). From there Talbot leads us to Habakkuk 3:17-18, (though) \"the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the LORD\" (ESV). This takes us to the triumphant chorus: \"The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places\" (Habakkuk 3:19 KJV). Multi-tracking John Michael's voice on the chorus (here and elsewhere), along with soaring music, that both end on a high note make this an exhilarating track. Any future collection of Talbot's best songs should include this.Talbot's trademark acoustic guitar style is mixed throughout with superb orchestration. The only exception are the non-musical tracks 10-16 (the \"Mass of Rebirth\" section), which consists of a series of short acapella chants, and calls and responses.Artistry and beauty are evident on every track, though the encouragement toward contemplative practices in tracks 7-9 may not be quite as aesthetic lyrically but is still well done.Among his output in recent years this has to rank as one of his best efforts. He unplugged for this one; the electric guitars and drums were shelved in favor of the acoustic and organic sound, but it's not sleepy. This is something to wake up to on Easter day or any other, for every day is like a resurrection day for the believer in Christ.Something about the Mass brings out the best in John Michael Talbot.\n", "val": 0.008373407647013664}

The gift of uniting diverse groups of people through music is truly a divine gift in these days. One we are in desparate need of! Celebrate with the body of Christ.

{"text": "First and foremost the lyrics on this album blow. me. away.  This album has it all -- rock, pop, soul a dash of international flavor -- all the influences mesh together brilliantly...and originally.  I think the best compliment I can pay is there isn't a single track on this CD that I skip.  There are not many CD's I can say that about... So I am no professional music reviewer by any stretch of the imagination (so be nice) but here are some random comments/thoughts on the tracks:*Old Tyme Religion - Told from the perspective of a dead man in a lover's triangle.  You have never heard anything quite like this, musically or lyrically.  This song is the perfect opening track as you instantly know that you are experiencing something special and a blend of music genres like you have never heard before.*99 Problems - Deliverance is no longer my frame of reference for banjos, so thanks for that, Hugo!  Seriously - to start with a hip hop song and end with this...brilliant*Bread and Butter - Okay, first came Barry White, then Enigma -- now Bread and Butter -- this song is sex, pure and simple (and so much better than Barry and Enigma!).*Rock and Roll Delight - Definitely where the 'pop' comes out to play the most - a catchy diddy for sure...*Hopelessly Stoned - \"Like a bug on my window pane/Safe inside from the wind and rain/Try to fly, but it's all in vain/Just hopeless, hopelessly stoned.\" This song is all over the place, in a very very good way - definitely one of the best tracks on the album.*Hurt Makes It Beautiful - A lot of truth to these lyrics.*Born - Very very catchy.  It will get stuck in your head.*Mekong River Delta - This song surprised me by becoming my favorite track on the album...and I can't for the life of me explain why...*Sweetest Cure - \"I want you again, don't want to be your friend/ I wanna be adored, not a voyeur\" -- I love that line!*Different Lives -- It is hard to comment on a song that is clearly so personal. This song is at the same time tragic and absolutely beautiful.*Just A Shred - Another catchy tune..you hear the international sounds in this one a lot*Wake Alone - \"If you only knew how much, I obsess over your touch/ I guess I'm old school in my ways\"  I'm not big on ballads.  This is a modern ballad like nothing I have heard before.  This song is another of the bigger achievements on this album in my opinion.This album seamlessly crosses generational and genre barriers - with style.

VERY nice.Ben Bowen King (5 of the 15) is apparently also a San Antonio \"local.\"  It's solo guitar work with a definite \"Windham Hill\" flavor, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's precision guitar work with FEELING, no doubt about it!Finally, there are 2 tunes by Gaelic Strings. \"New Age-y\", too?  Sure... but, again, what's wrong with THAT?!  Besides, you don't often hear \"new agers\" doing traditional gospel very often, do you?!All-in-all this is a very good album.  And it's WELL-recorded - at LEAST as good, if not better, than a LOT of the hyper-compressed MP3's out there.

{"text": "This is one seriously cool album!  The old adage of opening with one of your best songs signifying a poor album doesn't apply here.  Knuckle Down is certainly the song of the album.  However, the listing leads right into Pirahnas Club, which is just as creative and fun yet a little more bouncy, then mellows with Steak Knives showing a different and cool side of the group.  No doubt a bulk of these tracks exemplifies the experimental nature of the group but songs like Shamless show of the rock jazz roots and display an attitude of blowing the doors down with a dynamic and flirty power punch.  The album's namesake track for some reason brings me visions of the movie, Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, a rather silly and strange film that illustrates a confused and misunderstood brilliance within the human mind.  All told, great album!  I look forward to more endeavors from Man Man.\n", "val": 0.010590093210339546}
{"text": "I've been a fan of Man Man since their first album. What I loved about the band was that they had this feel and sound that I'd never heard before-like at any moment they were going to fly off the rails and plummet to their demise. From what I've read that was almost the case, and Life Fantastic is what happened when they decided to pull things together. Although some say that this album's weakness is its less chaotic nature, I find that to be its strength. Honus Honus is at his lyrical best on this album, a fact which is highlighted by the focused instrumentation. Life Fantastic is dark, catchy, lyrically dense and more focused than any Man Man effort to date-and that truly makes it a fantastic record.\n", "val": 0.03053385391831398}

{"text": "If it is one thing Man Man is known for it's for their feral sense of playing, almost a primal howl in the halls of modern music. But this album doesn't come across to me like that this time. It's a softer album, a gentle touch. Where the others cds were fueled by raw angry and heartbreak sound, this one channels it. For a senior album, it does show growth in the band and music.The tracks prove this point, each having a different feel and theme:1. Knuckle Down - a straight rock song dealing with on how to understand your significant other.2. Piranhas Club - a throwback to surf-a-billy talking about blowing off steam3. Steak Knives - one of the best tracks on the album. A lone guitar and Honus' voice questioning his love4. Dark Arts - a manic song with undertones of heartache5. Haute Tropique - another favorite track talking about we're born what we're meant to be, in some cases, cannibalism.6. Shameless -  a continuous build, each versus hyping the next about watching your heart in love.7. Spooky Jookie - a solid quasi-blues track.8. Eel Bros - a short salsa ditty.9. Bangkok Necktie - another throwback to 60s salsa music asking what does this world want of you.10. Life Fantastic - the title track that is hard to describe but that builds over time11. Oh, La Brea - a sweet, quirky track about...fossils?So while this albm isn't as strong as Six Demon Bag or Rabbit Habit, it is a mature step for Man Man. Each track is great, it just feels like something is missing. It might be me, but the album is solid and awesome. Check it out.

But musically, her songs haven't shown lately that they have the spark they once brought out from her era with Sony. Her latest song, So In Love with Anthony Hamilton, from her upcoming record The Light Of The Sun is alright, but honestly the song is very short. I also wish that there could've been a bit more with the chemistry between Anthony & Jill. I still hope there is better than what has came out from Jill already.

{"text": "This is really a great album.  The music is very upbeat but if you read the lyrics there is a lot of sadness and loss there.The album has Tara Nevins singing songs that are arranged differently than most of the stuff she sings with Donna The Buffalo.I think Wood and Stone is the only song that is sort of similar to Donna The Buffalo. Tennesee River has an almost heavy metal sound to it. I sounds a bit out of place on the mostly folky album but she makes it work and sounds natural singing it.Standouts on the album for me are Snowbird, What Money Cannot Buy, Nothing Really (which is a great old timey tune like the stuff she used to do- that I miss hearing -with the Heartbeats), The Wrong Side, and her version of the Beauty of the Days Gone by is incredible. Will bring a tear to your eye.There's really not a bad song on this one. Her singing has never been stronger and her fiddle playing is great. A lot of her fiddling is cajun esque but she's straight up old timey in a VERY excellent way on Nothing Really.Well worth the wait and tops her previous solo album which was also excellent in my opinion.Even if you aren't a Donna The Buffalo fan you'll love this one.\n", "val": 0.022836724296212196}
{"text": "Okay, kids, you've got to hear this one. I knew Tara Nevins back in the day when she was a brand new singer, and this album showcases her characteristic tightly-wrought songs, pitch-perfect melodies, and continuing development as an American roots singer who writes most of her own lyrics. The simplicity of the tracks, the directness and near-purity of the sound, made these songs go round and round in my head (in a good way) after I listened for the first time. I'm listening to \"Stars Fell on Alabama Last Night\" as I write this short review; it's a short tune that sticks. The mournful fiddle that opens \"Wood and Stone\" quickly yields to a catchy title tune that's probably my favorite. I can't believe how pure Nevins' voice is.

Without a co-vocalist sharing the microphone, Nevins' voice carries the album, and without a second writer, her songs stretch out across all her influences, including fiddle- and steel-lined country, second line rhythms and the Cajun sounds of her earlier band, the Heartbeats. The latter appear together on the energetic fiddle tune \"Nothing Really,\" and individually on several other tracks. Additional guests include Levon Helm (drumming on two tracks), Allison Moorer (tight trio harmony with Teresa Williams on \"The Wrong Side\") and Jim Lauderdale (harmony on the acoustic \"Snowbird\").Producer Larry Campbell fits each song with a unique groove and adds superb electric and pedal steel guitar. The girlishness in Nevins' voice and the layering of double-tracked vocals add a hint of the Brill Building, which is a terrific twist on the rustic arrangements. The lyrics cast an eye on relationships that refuse to live up to their potential, with music that underlines the certainty of a woman who will no longer suffer others' indecision, inaction or infidelity. Three deftly picked covers include the standard \"Stars Fell on Alabama\" (from the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/20-Years-After/dp/B001DTWX1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">20 Years After</a>), the traditional \"Down South Blues,\" and Van Morrison's \"Beauty of Days Gone By.\" Campbell and Nevins work some real magic here, creating a musical platform that often feels a more crafted fit for Nevins' singing than that of her long-time group.

All three of those albums fell very clearly in the progressive bluegrass/new-acoustic tradition set by groups like Strength In Numbers (of which Meyer was a member), and all three were strongly influenced by classical music.  However, his duet album with Edgar Meyer, like his Punch Brothers project, had a very modern feel, incorporating dissonance in a way that pre-20th Century classical music rarely did.  Knowing that, one might expect another occasionally-dissonant, classical-influenced newgrass album.  Instead, Thile goes in the exact opposite direction.Michael Daves is a much more anachronistic player than Thile.  Another reviewer appropriately compared Daves' voice to Del McCoury, but his guitar style is closer to my personal favorite, Larry Keel.  So, his picking style is far more aggressive than conventional flatpickers.  In fact, his aggressive attack has a feel closer to Dock Boggs' or Roscoe Holcomb's early banjo recordings than to Tony Rice, or even Doc Watson.  In fact, the Del McCoury style of singing is also a throwback to Boggs' and Holcomb's early sound, so far more than Thile, Daves looks to the distant past for his musical inspiration, and this album is closer to Daves' style than to Thile's previous recordings.  However, this album is far from anachronistic.  When British kids started trying to play blues in the 1960's, the music was filtered through post-war British sensibilities, and the resulting music didn't really sound like American blues.  (The purpose of this analogy is not to cast judgment one way or another about British blues-- it is just a demonstration of the process).  In the same way, Thile and Daves reach back to traditional sources, but filter the sounds through the modern sensibilities of kids raised on modern music.  So, contrary to what another reviewer has indicated, the result is not a traditional-sounding album.In order to demonstrate that point, think about some of the more traditional bluegrass duet albums.  Consider, for example, the Doc Watson/Bill Monroe duet album.  Given that it was a duet between the founder of the bluegrass genre and the founder of bluegrass guitar, we can take that as the standard for a traditional bluegrass guitar/mandolin duet.  Thile and Daves sound nothing like Monroe and Watson.  Instead, they play with an aggressive attitude that owes as much to rock as to country, courtesy of Daves, who is probably a huge fan of Larry Keel.  That aggression was lacking in the Monroe/Watson duet.  Similarly, that aggression was lacking on the Doc Watson-David Grisman duet album.  That album might serve as an even more obvious reference point given that Thile is clearly more in the Grisman camp than the Monroe camp as a mandolin player.  However, neither Doc Watson nor David Grisman nor Bill Moroe grew up listening to rock, so they didn't play traditional music the way that Thile and Daves do.  Compared to the Punch Brothers, this is a traditional album, but it doesn't sound like any traditional album I own, and I own a lot of traditional albums.  Instead, it sounds like a couple of very talented young players filtering traditional sounds through modern sensibilities.  It sounds like what happens when kids raised on rock pay homage to tradition without simply replicating it.Further listening:Anything by Larry Keel.  He sings like a redneck Tom Waits, and plays flatpicked guitar like an angry lunatic.  He is brilliant.Tim O'Brien and Darrell Scott, Real Time.  This may be my favorite bluegrass album of all time.  It is a perfect, stripped down duet.  The instrumental work is less flashy than Thile and Daves, but O'Brien has THE PERFECT bluegrass voice, and Scott has a wonderful voice too.  This album is about as close to Sleep With One Eye Open as anything I own.Gillian Welch, Hell Among The Yearlings.  Gillian Welch and David Rawlings manage to make pre-bluegrass country music sound modern.  All of their albums are great, but this one is my favorite.  It is not bluegrass, and it is much slower than Sleep With One Eye Open, but it is a great example of younger musicians filtering traditional music through modern sensibilities.\n", "val": 0.00017361895879730582}
{"text": "If you're like me and you respect & appreciate the traditional Bill Monroe quintet format -- but you wish more people would sacrifice some of the traditional approaches in favor of exploring alternative avenues, then you'll probably like this album.  I've leaned a lot toward listening to duets and trios for quite some time and for the reason that everyone loves:  there's no big rhythm section to hide behind-- it tests each player's ability to do something constructive/interesting/creative from one moment to the next and it's there for everyone to see. To my ears, the quintet gets kind of old b/c it's just too crowded.  As you would expect, Chris really thrives in this setting (as he does in any other setting)- great hooks, fills, leads and vocals on all tracks.  Michael's vocals kind of remind me of Del McCoury's --he's not quite as high & lonesome as Del-but he channels some of the same energy thru a slightly lower register and it all works!  Similarly, his approach to guitar is his own- some influences of the bluegrass greats we're all accustomed to listening to are there-- but it's all channeled thru this unique filter that's all his own.  Hey Chris-- for your next album, how about trying just you and the Gibson/Dudenbostel?\n", "val": 0.003449631156399846}
{"text": "I am a huge fan of Chris Thile.  Antifogmatic was my favorite album of 2010, and I'm still amazed by it, despite the fact that it's been around for almost a year.  With that in mind, I was curious to see how this Thile/Daves collaboration would turn out.I had figured it would be a traditional bluegrass band, and that they would probably hire session musicians to play the bass, banjo, and possibly fiddle.  When I heard the free mp3 they sent out a few weeks ago, I learned that this is actually a real duet, with Thile on mandolin, Daves on guitar, and both singing harmony.The material is traditional songs and old bluegrass tunes.  One would think there is only so much someone can do with a guitar, a mandolin, and some old songs, and he would be right.  But what they have done is nothing short of great.  The harmonies are perfectly matched, and the arrangements are at once interesting and technically stunning.  Despite the use of just two instruments, I did not get the sense that there was something missing--that there was some void that needed filling.You don't listen to this album because you're looking for groundbreaking work, or because you need to be moved somehow.  This is one you listen to because you want to hear excellent guitar and mandolin performances, and good old-fashioned harmonizing.  As I've said elsewhere, I don't feel like my music collection is missing something without it, but I very much enjoy listening to it.\n", "val": 0.018500061705708504}

{"text": "Wow, a smoking fast set showing incredible chops on guitar and mandolin complemented by virtuoso harmony singing. The rapt listener can only be overwhelmed by the amount of sound from two guys, one mic, and a tape machine. Chris Thile is well-known but Michael Daves is no slouch himself, nailing every break at high speed and playing the style of leading bass line bluegrass that would have put a smile on Bill Monroe's face (which would have been a first). What he does with an old plywood guitar is a reminder to players everywhere that the touch of the musician is the real instrument. And Chris Thile's mandolin playing is jaw-dropping as usual. That he can play so fast and clean, and with so much melody, is remarkable.I think many listeners also will find the sound quality a bit odd at first, maybe \"cheap sounding.\" One-mic recording has that quality. But it's easy to get used to, just what you would hear if two guys were playing in your living room (in fact Chris and Michael played a one-mic set for National Public Radio's \"Tiny Desk Concert\" series and it sounded just like the record). Because modern studios isolate vocals and are able to move them to the foreground with Pro Tools, a true natural sound has faded from memory.I hope these guys do more music together.

{"text": "This is an excellent CD. The bluegrass format is a very well-defined, standardized thing. 5 people, string instuments, and (optionally) a single microphone. This CD is a duet CD. Furthermore, the two singers sing in a harmony more like classic Country music. The result is still, like bluegrass, very bouncy. However, the end result also feels a lot more personal. Bluegrass music aims to tell personal stories to a crowd. This duet effort can tell a story just to you.There are preview videos on the Internet that give little snippets of the songs performed. They do not sound the same as the tracks on the CD. Apparently the CD was recorded using a single vintage ribbon microphone and the videos used something different. Listen to the samples and you'll find that the tracks on the CD feel more mid-rangey and a bit compressed. I couldn't say that this wasn't done on purpose. Thile was nominated for a Grammy for his sound engineering prowess. The sound that you get is more of a intimate kitchen table sort of sound. Not acoustic perfection, but it lends a bit of reality to the music. I think little is lost to the effect.\n", "val": 0.003754347562789917}
{"text": "The last time I was this excited about a bluegrass album was J.D. Crowe & The New South's debut for Rounder in 1975.  But what makes SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN so amazing that it's just two musicians.  The firepower provided by mandolinist Chris Thile and guitarist Michael Daves is amazing.I'm reminded of the 1980 recording SKAGGS & RICE, another mandolin-guitar duet album.  In fact, these recordings share two tracks:  the Bill Monroe-penned instrumental \"Tennessee Blues\" and the traditional \"Bury Me Beneath the Willow.\"While both of these albums feature two artists whose voices and instruments intertwine seamlessly with each other, I give the nod to SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN for the sheer octane level on such songs as \"Rabbit in the Log,\" \"Sophronie\" and the title track.While some might argue that Thile and Daves bring nothing new to these bluegrass chestnuts, that's only true if you don't count the youthful exuberance they bring to the table.

{"text": "With the minor exception of \"Hey Mambo\", none of these fifteen duets were hits; however, they are all good-to-great songs that make for a truly entertaining album.  The earliest is the CD closer \"The Last Duet\", from the long out-of-print \"Barry\" (1980).  It's a (fairly) funny, discofied parody of the then-rampant duet trend sung with Lily Tomlin (!).  Both jazzy duets from Barry's career landmark \"2:00 A.M. Paradise Cafe\" (1984) are included:  \"Big City Blues\" with Mel Torme (featuring Gerry Mulligan) and \"Blue\" with Sarah Vaughan.  \"Run To Me\" (1985) is from a Dionne Warwick LP called \"Finder of Lost Loves\"--named after a hit TV show of the time.  Actually, I never warmed up to Dionne's vocal on this song; I usually love her but something sounds off to me.  This was Barry's first pop single after \"2:00 A.M.\" and it failed to nick the Hot 100, reaching 12 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\"Hey Mambo\" and \"Summertime\" (with Dianne Schuur) are from the excellent pop/jazz album \"Swing Street\" (1987).  \"Mambo\" put Kid Creole and the Coconuts on the Hot 100 for the only time, and Barry for the last time (so far--hope springs eternal).  It's a great dance number produced by Gloria Estefan's husband Emilio and is somewhat reminiscent of \"Conga\" and \"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\".  \"Look To the Rainbow\" is a beautiful ballad with Barbara Cook from the 1991 CD \"Showstoppers\", which consisted of songs from Broadway shows.In 1994, Barry did the soundtrack for an animated movie called \"Thumbelina\".  The single \"Let Me Be Your Wings\", with longtime backup singer (and sometime American Idol vocal coach) Debra Byrd actually dented the British pop chart at number 73.  The only song on this CD I never heard of before is \"Now and Forever\" with Sheena Easton.  The liner notes say this was \"released\" in 1995, but don't say what if any disc it comes from.  I have never heard Barry's voice more buried in echo than it is on this song.If it had been released in 1977-1981, the Barbra Streisand duet \"I Won't Be the One To Let Go\" would have been an easy Top 10 pop hit.  In 2002, from Barbra's own \"Duets\" CD, it sank like a stone, not even making the AC chart.  A shame, because it's really pretty and the two megastars sound great together.  \"On a Slow Boat To China\" with Bette Midler from her \"Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook\" CD is very cute and plays on Barry and Bette's long history together.Finally, there are songs from each of Barry's \"Greatest Songs of the...\" CDs that marked an amazing album chart renaissance for him.  The Fifties CD that started it all became his first #1 album since \"Live\" in 1977.  It's nice to hear Phyllis McGuire still sounding good after all these years.  But the performance and arrangement of the Sixties CD's entry here, \"Cherish/Windy\" with the venerable Association, is perhaps the most amazing song on this (or that) CD.  The two classics swoop around each other brilliantly as Barry and the Association harmonize like he was in on the original records with them.  I assume the group performed this with Barry and are not sampled.  But this is a fantastic song/medley that deserves more attention than it's gotten.  The Seventies song is a remixed version (what's different from the original?  no idea) of \"You've Got a Friend\" with old friend Melissa Manchester, and from the Eighties CD comes \"Islands in the Stream\" with Reba McEntire.Except for the Sheena duet, which I can't seem to get behind, this is all great stuff.  Not a reflection of Barry's hitmaking career, but a bunch of coulda been shoulda beens.  I think fans both casual and fanatical will really appreciate this CD.\n", "val": 0.008140466175973415}

{"text": "At this point, Barry's people seem to enjoy releasing a \"warm up\" compilation when he is about to release something new (\"15 Minutes\" in June).  This time, \"Duets\" was the result and it's a pretty good album.  The set is relatively strong and many cuts have been rarely heard by most people, I would imagine, especially if the listener decided to skip out on Barry's decades albums--two of these cuts (\"Islands...\" and \"Cherish/Windy\") are among the best songs on the album.  The set is a bit on the soft side, even for Barry... \"Look To The Rainbow\" and the Streisand duet are not favorites of mine.  But the more interesting cuts like \"Last Duet\" and \"Run To Me\" are fantastic and have not been included on any releases in many years.

{"text": "This is an outstanding compilation of 15 Barry duets over the years with some other real famous grammy-award winning folks, and it is wonderful!  What a line-up!  A hair over one hour (almost 62 minutes) of beautiful music!  Also included is a 16-page booklet with photos of Barry with many of these folks as well as a little bit of verbiage about the album.  Just for an added special touch, the CD case is heavier and better quality than most you receive with a new CD.CD1.  You've Got A Friend (with Melissa Manchester) - 2011 release -- \"previously unreleased mix\" - If you say \"I have this already,\" - yes, so do I, but this has additional enhancement added in and is even better than the rendition from the former collection.2.  Hey Mambo (with Kid Creole and the Coconuts) - 1987 release - Nice peppy song from Barry's \"Swing Street\" CD - latin-swing.3.  Let Me Be Your Wings (with Debra Byrd) - 1994 release - from the Thumbelina Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.  This is a very beautiful song.4.  Cherish/Windy (with The Association) - 2006 release - beautiful arrangement combining the two songs from Barry's \"The Greatest Songs of the Sixties\" CD.5.  Look to the Rainbow (with Barbara Cook) - 1991 release - from the 1947 musical Finian's Rainbow  and on Barry's \"Showstoppers\" CD - I absolutely LOVE this song.  It is so very beautiful.  (This is one of two Barry songs that makes me feel as if I've come \"home\" again.  I have no idea why.)6.  Islands in the Stream (with Reba McEntire) - 2008 release - a peppy \"fun\" song from Barry's \"The Greatest Songs of the Eighties\" CD.7.  Big City Blues (with Mel Torme' and featuring Gerry Mulligan) -- - 1984 release - from Barry's \"2:00 a.m. Paradise Caf'\" jazz CD.8.  On a Slow Boat to China (with Bette Midler) - 2003 release - a cute, peppy rendition of a classic song (with added comedic lyrics) from Bette's \"Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook\" CD.  This is a \"fun\" song.9.  Run to Me (with Dionne Warwick) - 1985 release - from the Warwick \"Finder of Lost Loves\" CD and from the Barry \"The Manilow Collection/Twenty Classic Hits\".10. Summertime (with Diane Schuur and featuring Stan Getz) - 1987 release - This famous Gershwin tune from Porgy and Bess is just awesome.11. Sincerely/Teach Me Tonight (with Phyllis McGuire) - 2006 release - from Barry's \"Greatest Songs of the Fifties\".  This is also a very pretty arrangement of two great songs.  Very smoothly done.12 .Blue (with Sarah Vaughan) - 1984 release - from Barry's \"2:00 a.m. Paradise Caf'\" jazz CD.13. Now and Forever (with Sheena Easton) - 1995 release - Such a gorgeous song from the DVD \"The Pebble and the Penguin\" (such a cute little movie about penguins that Barry did all the musical arranging for).  This may be a \"kid's\" movie, but I loved it too--and the music was superb!14. I Won't Be the One to Let Go (with Barbra Streisand) - 2002 release from the Barbra Streisand \"Duets\" CD.  A beautiful song!  Does it get any better than Manilow and Streisand together!15. The Last Duet (with Lily Tomlin) - 1980 release from the Barry \"Barry\" CD.  An interesting and lively song, which includes Lily's famous \"snort\".BookletThe full-color 16-page booklet includes pictures of Barry with most of the other celebrities in the duets.  What is also so cool is that these are pix over the years, ranging from 1980 to 2008.  Pix include Barry with: Kid Creole, Debra Byrd, Reba McEntire, Bette Midler, Dionne Warwick, Diane Schuur, Phyllis McGuire, Barbra Streisand, Lily Tomlin, and Mel Torme' (in a NY Yankees Baseball cap).This is just one awesome collection and a real nice bang for the buck! BTW, many of the duets are not easily found on other Barry albums. One song may be on only one album.Update 5/21/11 - There are some gorgeous duets on this album but #1 to me is \"Now and Forever\".  It's a wonderful song, and Barry and Sheena sound GREAT together.  It's a wonder I haven't worn out the track yet, but I'm trying. . .\n", "val": 0.03205188736319542}

Folks, this was a waste unless you want to edit out the endings of most of these songs.  They aren't inspiring. They're jarring and irritating in their sameness.

{"text": "I love this series of albums because they conjure up such great pictures in my imagination.  If I were a film producer, I'd shoot a film to use some of it. Reign of Vengeance is not about the one rope used to keep my horse Vengeance in check. Indeed, it is about a luckless hero, who, upon failing to save the fair maiden with whom he has a karmic soul connection, has the ill fortune of running into the insane king.  Said King, insane since birth due to the heavy interbreeding that caused his mother to be both his sister and his aunt (who wouldn't be slightly mad about that?) has developed a taste of the flesh of fair maidens (and this is not in a good way.) This lively album chronicles the imaginary hero's fight back from luckless to lucky, as he and his band of stalwart Amazon maidens (one of whom he has a crush upon) overcome seemingly inconceivable barriers to break into the palace kitchen mere moments before the hapless maiden is to be boiled in peanut oil! The mad king, as outlines in track 17, gets ever madder and transforms himself into a huge snow storm. That was a mistake, because this entire story takes place in the Sahara.  All this from one album! How could you go wrong!\n", "val": 0.0003990776604041457}
{"text": "First of all, I am somewhat of a general novice on this form of music. My review can be catagorized as much as a particular afficionado than a qoute 'expert' when rating music in whole. My ear is more trained to import the bounds of music into words, rather than visa versa. A writer needs to find inspiration wherever it can; to discover any form of muse that we may. It helps to articulate emotions into the subject matters we create.Trailer or epic music is rather new to me. I have always been drawn to epic scores (i.e. Gladiator, King Arthur to name a few) and have a music line of nearly two hundred scores in total. To date, I have never been compelled to write a review for any music, book, item I have purchased through Amazon or any onsite vehicle.So to draw me to this conclusion took a gallactic feat of its own. I have very very acute hearing and have been tested in the highest percentile of hearing capacity. My 'likes' with music are far beyond electic in nature; more like extreme particulars.This being said, this particular soundtrack is the best soundtrack I have ever heard. It draws to speak to your emotions; has a spiritual quality I have rarely heard before. This soundtrack has been incalculable in aiding me in my new work I am currently writing (The Chronicles of Good and Evil).Some of the standout tracks are:Timekeeper - is immense and valiant in mood and stamina. The quality to this track is one of the finest pieces of music I have ever heard. A tremendous achievement.Welcome to Your Fantasy - is the very root of mystery and poetic personification.Miracle of Flight - abounds with eternal hope and a supreme serenity all its own.Flight of the Dreamers - is entirely unique and very adept to its title.Final Judgement - has an aura of ambiguous qualities quite unlike any I've heard.Ascension - draws you in with its tensive and continuous balance/ thematic score.I would encourage anyone to get this soundtrack, whether a fan of this style of music or not. It has supreme quality (with the exception of a few tracks), angelic styles and movements; choral qualities embedded in the finest symphonic ensembles anywhere. I would love to hear this entire track live and in a theater setting. Overall, it truly is a marvel to quality music creation. Future World Music should be highly commended for putting out such a fantastic piece of work.The sum of which is simply greater than any one part. I do believe that even in our modern day society, there are artist who are capable of creating a masterpiece. This soundtrack comes as close to this adjective staple as any I've heard, outside of the general classics derived throughout history.I look forward to Future World Music's new soundtrack!\n", "val": 0.03505576029419899}

{"text": "As a force of habit, I buy every Glee album. Every single one, excepting the Warblers one (because however good they are, it isn't really Glee, is it?). So I pre-ordered this one, long before I had any idea of its content or song selection. I have been impressed with many Glee albums, but this ranks undoubtedly among my favourites. It showcases the cast in many different ways, and always provides something new on listening.1) Turning Tables (Adele) - whilst this episode provided some other stand-out songs (alongside mediocre plot lines), this song is Paltrow's last of season 2 and is very good. It's an interesting choice as well, as Turning Tables is a virtually unknown Adele song. It is easy to listen to and probably the most vocally accomplished of all Paltrow's performances.2) I Feel Pretty/Unpretty (West Side Story/TLC) - I think all of us were nervous when they heard that Lea Michele and Dianna Agron would be duetting. They both have lovely voices, but in many ways that is all Agron's voice amounts to. Michele's powerful one would surely drown out Agron's, no? We were all proved wrong; their voices blend wonderfully and this mash-up is very, very interesting as well as being fantastic to listen to.3) As If We Never Said Goodbye (Sunset Boulevard) - this is by no means the most accomplished of Chris Colfer's performances and it did seem to go on a little too long in the episode itself, but it fits the actor and the character and is a good listen.4) Born This Way (Lady Gaga) - as the theme of the episode \"Born This Way\", it's very good in the episode, especially with the T-shirts, but it stands up to lots of listening as well. It also showcases Riley, Colfer and Ushkowitz to effect, the former and latter not being showcased much in this album as a whole.5) Dreams (Fleetwood Mac) - Kristin Chenoweth has returned! Her voice, blended with Matthew Morrison's, suits this song marvellously and I cannot overstate the wonder of this song. It is beautiful and does justice to the original.6) Songbird (Fleetwood Mac) - yes, it is another \"I love Brittany\" song by Rivera, but her voice is beautiful and original in this.7) Go Your Own Way (Fleetwood Mac) - Lea Michele is wonderful on this song, as always. Originally sung by a man, she \"smashes\" this song with her powerhouse vocals, and the fact that its another pining-after-Finn-song is easily forgotten by the time you've listened to it a few times.8) Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac) - this version has been stuck in my head for four days. It's wonderfully catchy (although that is to Fleetwood Mac's credit) and is the first major vocal contribution of Chord Overstreet since the thirteenth episode.9) Rolling in the Deep (Adele) - although Jesse St James's return would eventually be seen as pointless, no matter how much we wanted it early on, at this point his entrance is MAGNIFICENT. The very best possible entrance to the show and this song demonstrates it beautifully; as well as the fact that he and Lea Michele's vocal chemistry is immense.10) Isn't She Lovely (Stevie Wonder) - I think the only contribution to the album by Kevin McHale and an unusual one! I personally preferred his \"Never Going Back Again\" in the Fleetwood Mac episode but this is good, as well...11) Dancing Queen (ABBA) - YES, YES, YES!! How long we have wanted ABBA on Glee! The third duet of Rivera and Riley and they are so good together! It fitted the episode and it is amazing to listen to. More ABBA songs, please, Glee!12) Try A Little Tenderness (Otis Redding) - Ugh. Amber Riley's voice is so much more beautiful when it's allowed to be gentle and deep - think \"Imagine\" in season 1. In this song, it's fairly butchered. I'm sorry, but it does not justice to her.13) My Man (Funny Girl) - Not being a large Streisand fan (\"Don't Rain On My Parade\" never really got me going) I was very 'meh' about this song, when I first heard of it being in Glee. However, I state now that all the solos that I have loved about Lea Michele both this season and last are almost insignificant when compared to this. It's wonderful.14) Pure Imagination (Willy Wonka) - this got me crying in the episode. It's beautiful.15) Bella Notte (Lady and the Tramp) - and this will probably be my major gripe about this album. This is a very nice song - it's Disney, for Chrissake! - but it's not particularly \"Wow\". And Colfer and Michele's \"For Good\" from the same episode most certainly was. So, I really cannot see how anyone in their right mind could choose this in album over that, but then again, if it were my choice this album would really be made up of Colfer and Michele duets!16) As Long As You're There (original) - it's good, of course, Charice is wonderful, etc etc but there wasn't really much background in the episode to it being original and so it's hard to really get invested in it.17) Pretending (original) - it's nowhere near as epic as \"Faithfully\" of last year, and nowhere near as joyful, but it's a good duet between Monteith and Michele and made better by the fact, there's no solos and yet Monteith still manages to hold his own.18) Light Up the World (original) - great song, no, there's not really much investment in it, but it is a great song.All in all (as well as having some pretty amazing artwork!) this is a wonderful album.\n", "val": 0.02945609577000141}
{"text": "While Vol. 5 of Glee The Music stood out from being all upbeat and contemporary, Vol. 6 takes the total opposite turn. In a way, this is also a reflection of the final episodes of Season 2, which focused much more on showcasing the cast's vocal talent and simply turned it down on modern hits in favor for the more diverse formula we've grown to love from the series which includes ballads, showtunes, top 40 and classic rock. And you want to throw in original songs in there now since Glee is now doing that as well. Chris Colfer, Lea Michele, Amber Riley, Naya Rivera, Kevin Mchale, Mark Salling, Charice, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kristen Chenoweth, Jonathan Groff... all these big names get their solos and you really don't want to miss them. They all kill it.I sure feel this is the best Glee cd so far. It's not made to be \"fun\" like Vol. 5, its mostly made to be an enjoyable laid-back listen... an experience for your ears. And surprisingly, the songs seem to fit together perfectly well, which is not easy to do on a Glee CD.  Thats always a good thing. This album also features 3 original songs which, in my opinion, are even better than the original songs in Vol. 5., and sort of give more of a balanced and modern 'idol' sound that you'd expect from a FOX show.Overall, this must be the best Glee cd so far. There's something for everyone here: Fleetwood Mac, Lady Gaga, Adele, ABBA.. hell even some Willy Wonka. There's just pure talent here and this is how a Glee season should wrap up. Fans, go for it. Non-fans of Glee, listen to the previews and be the judges.\n", "val": 0.016703955829143524}
{"text": "After a slightly lackluster past two releases, it seems that the powers at be have settled on a track list that delivers most of the best songs of the episodes that this spans across. The problem with Volumes 4 and 5 was that there were tracks that had performed rather poorly on iTunes (Just the Way You Are for Vol. 4, Kiss for Vol. 5), yet were still included on the soundtracks for some odd reason. Here, nearly all of the songs are solid picks from their respective episodes.The best moments tend to be the most original. 'I Feel Pretty/Unpretty' is a beautiful, restrained duet that showcases Dianna Agron at her best, and 'Rolling in the Deep' is a stunning a cappella cover that doesn't even resemble the original. Other standout covers include 'Songbird', 'Go Your Own Way', and 'As Long As You're There'.There aren't any downright awful songs here. However, Gwenyth Paltrow simply can't compete with Adele's majestic original of 'Turning Tables', especially considering it is such a new song. She does do quite a good job of mustering up the vulnerability of the song, though. 'As If We Never Said Goodbye' is possibly the worst song here, clocking it at almost five minutes. It's not one that will likely appeal to anyone outside of Broadways circles. 'Dreams' is a bit bland, and 'Don't Stop' should have been switched out for the scathing 'I Don't Want to Know' duet. Lastly, 'Try a Little Tenderness' is a bit over the top, and just doesn't jive well with these other songs.The rest fall somewhere in between. It should be noted that the two original songs, 'Pretending' and 'Light Up the World', are very good. 'Pretending' is a solid ballad to follow up the previous original 'Get It Right', which was outstanding, and 'Light Up the World' is quite a bit better than 'Loser Like Me,' an exceptional bit of techno-influenced pop.Overall, this is a very solid release. There's barely a trace of Matthew Morrison, who usually squanders his talents are awful rap numbers (Kiss was just an awful rendition). The best songs on the release are actually the two original numbers, plus 'I Feel Pretty/Unpretty.' Altogether, this is worthy of an album purchase.\n", "val": 0.0009559440077282488}

I would have put some other songs that I enjoyed on the show verses some of the ones that were included on the cd. The only song I did not like that was on the CD was Gweneth Paltrow's Turning Tables. I just don't think that song should have been included on this final volumne of the season, I think another song from the season would have been better, I don't care for Gweneth's version of it! But overall am happy with the choices. My favorite girl cast member is Rachel and I am glad she had more songs on the CD, I was also glad to hear Mercades had a song, that she did such a fabulous job on it!

{"text": "The sixth regular musical collection from the hit TV series \"Glee\" (there having previously been additionally a few other special collections, either holiday-themed or devoted to specific episodes) is a decent cross-section of the music from episodes 17 to 22 of the second season.  This is one of the larger stretches of episodes covered by a single CD among the recent collections, and I'd argue that it shows in some of the omissions.  However, one obviously can't include everything (nor should one, since, much like pop culture in general, not everything to show produces is ultimately very good).Compared to some past collections this year, it doesn't feel like any major voices from the show are significantly underrepresented.  It's also worth noting the significant presence of several major guest-stars on this CD:  not just Gwyneth Paltrow, who has had songs on two previous volumes, but also Charice, Kristin Chenoweth, and Jonathan Groff.  The individual songs on this volume are:1.  \"Turning Tables\" (originally by Adele) - the sole contribution to this album from returning guest star Paltrow is the first of two Adele covers here (the other of which also features a returning guest star).  Paltrow has impressed as a surprisingly good singer in the past, and she does fine here, but she lacks the distinctiveness that has made Adele stand out.  Competent.2.  \"I Feel Pretty/Unpretty\" (a mashup of songs originally from the musical \"West Side Story\" and TLC) - one of the standouts of the collection, and the season as a whole, is this affecting mashup featuring Lea Michele (Rachel) and Dianna Agron (Quinn).  Agron is arguably the weakest female singer in the cast generally, but this is by far the best work that she has ever done.  Superb.3.  \"As If We Never Said Goodbye\" (originally from the musical \"Sunset Boulevard\") - Chris Colfer (Kurt) delivers another Broadway diva cover, this time easily my favourite of the bunch that he's done.  This is an affecting cover of a lesser-known Andrew Lloyd Webber song that stands on its own while also gaining considerable effect from the story context in which it was sung.4.  \"Born This Way\" (originally by Lady Gaga) - the cast revisits Lady Gaga, with Colfer, Amber Riley (Mercedes) and Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina) taking the lead.  The cast are fine and well-suited to Gaga (as per last year's \"Bad Romance\", which also featured all three of them), but I don't care for this song at all in its original.5.  \"Dreams\" (originally by Fleetwood Mac) - the first of four covers from the Fleetwood Mac episode, featuring guest star Chenoweth and Matthew Morrison (Will), who doesn't get to sing nearly as much as his talent merits.  A fine cover.6.  \"Songbird\" (originally by Fleetwood Mac) - the second cover, this time a solo for Naya Rivera (Santana), who, after a number of impressive major outings, gets a really emotional song to perform, rather than just something high-energy but low on significance.  Rivera is exemplary, as usual, and this cover is actually even more minimalist in instrumentation than the original.7.  \"Go Your Own Way\" (originally by Fleetwood Mac) - Michele puts a feminine twist on this standard, and brings her A-game, as usual.  Changing genders is a fairly standard way to vary up a cover, but it's excellent all the same.8.  \"Don't Stop\" (originally by Fleetwood Mac) - a group number, which has become increasingly rare, featuring Cory Monteith (Finn), Chord Overstreet (Sam), Agron, and Michele.  Serviceable, but the least of the Fleetwood Mac songs included in the episode (including Kevin McHale's cover of \"Never Going Back Again, which was widely acclaimed but isn't included here).9.  \"Rolling in the Deep\" (originally by Adele) - the second Adele song, featuring Michele and Jonathan Groff.  This is one of the show's more major departures in style, as the song is covered acapella, similar to the cover by John Legend.  Distinct and interesting for that reason.  And Groff and Michele have strong vocal chemistry.10.  \"Isn't She Lovely\" (originally by Stevie Wonder) - McHale (Artie) does a fairly straight cover of Wonder's song.11.  \"Dancing Queen\" (originally by ABBA) - ah, ABBA, you and \"Glee\" meet at last.  Rivera and Riley take the lead on this fun, if, again, fairly standard cover.  But I'm a huge fan of both their voices, particularly when they aren't forcing Riley to do a bunch of wholly gratuitous trills and wails...like this next song.12.  \"Try A Little Tenderness\" (originally by Otis Redding) - this cover embodies everything I like the least about the way the show uses Riley.  It's extremely loud and full of runs and wails, and lacking in any tenderness.  Riley's talent is best-employed when she's singing lower.13.  \"My Man\" (most famously covered by Barbra Streisand) - Lea Michele gets to perform her all-time favourite song on the show, and does a fine job.14.  \"Pure Imagination\" (from \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\") - a superb group number featuring Colfer, Monteith, Ushkowitz, and McHale.  One of my favourites of the season.15.  \"Bella Notte\" (originally from \"Lady and the Tramp\") - okay cover by Mark Salling (Puck), Overstreet and McHale, that is really more significant in that it represents the first authorization to use a Disney song on the show than anything else (please let this signify their catalogue being available for more extensive use next year).16-18. \"As Long As You're There\", \"Pretending\", and \"Light Up The World\" - I'll just talk about all these together, as they're three further original songs commissioned specifically for the show.  There's some novelty factor to these, but it's wearing out, and the new songs are at most competent pop songs.  \"Light Up The World\" is rather on the twee side, and rather overproduced as well.  While it was an interesting experiment, I hope the show will avoid these for future competitions and go back to doing stirring reinterpretations of old standards.\n", "val": 0.015751708298921585}
{"text": "The final CD for Season 2, which is the 6th full album, is nothing short of spectacular from front to back. Maybe one of the best of the entire series, thanks to some HEAVY hitting covers, and epic guest stars from Gwyneth Paltrow as the sultry Holly Holliday, to Kristin Chenoweth as the hilarious booze hound April Rhodes, to Jonathan Groff's triumphant return as Jesse St. James. The entire experience is as 'Gleeful' as we've come to expect. And so without further ado, my humble opinions of Glee: The Music, Volume 6...1). A+ - Gwyneth Paltrow (Holly Holliday) - Turning Tables - This is probably my absolute favorite of Gwyneth Paltrow's Glee numbers. And has anyone noticed that as she is getting more and more confident that she can, in fact, sing... She's getting AMAZING! I loved Forget You, and Do You Want Touch Me, but this is haunting and heartbreaking, as pretty much anything by the masterful vocals of Adele is... And Gwyneth does it complete and total justice. Amazing!2). A - Lea Michele (Rachel Berry) and Dianna Agron (Quinn Fabray) - I Feel Pretty/Unpretty - Dianna Agron is noticeably underused, and it's almost understandable with voices like Lea's and Amber's and Chris'... But she has a pure, soft, lovely voice nonetheless, and it's REALLY showcased here. This is yet another BRILLIANT Glee mash-up, and the song is all the more powerful once you've seen the episode it comes from. So beautiful...3). A+ - Chris Colfer (Kurt) - As If We Never Said Goodbye - I look back and I can't believe that the first time I  heard Chris Colfer sing, I did a double take and I was like; \"WOW that's high! He sounds weird!\" And I guess what I really meant is he sounds different... They say a line in the first season of Glee that says Kurt is doing things that no one else can do... This proves that. To say he KILLS this song is a travesty of an understatement. One of the best vocal performances I've ever heard. He's got a long career ahead of him, possibly as a true Broadway Devo.4). A++ - Amber Riley (Mercedes), Chris Colfer (Kurt), Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina Cohen Chang) - Born This Way - Gaga's song of self accept, nay, ANTHEM of self acceptance, was brilliant beforehand. Gaga's not for everyone, but this song is going to be looked back on as the soundtrack of a new era, when acceptance was starting to take hold. I loved Gaga's, and then you add the pipes that these folks have? SMOKIN' HOT VOCALS! Just... wow... One of the few Glee songs that I rank above an A+.5). A- - Kristin Chenoweth (April Rhodes) and Matthew Morrison (Mr. Shue) - Dreams - I LOVE me some Stevie Nicks... But I was born at the time of Fleetwood Mac's mainstream success, and grew up in the 80's, so it just wasn't my style of music. But Kristin and Matthew ALWAYS sound great together. Great vocal harmonies.6). A - Naya Rivera (Santana) - Songbird - WHOA does Naya sing this BEAUTIFULLY. And the part of the plotline it goes along with... Just wow... I cried, and she sings and acts this one out flawlessly. She needs more solos! Or at the least more major duets! With Brittany! LOL7). A - Lea Michele (Rachel Berry) - Go Your Own Way - This is an amazing Fleetwood Mac song, and Lea Michele just knocks this one out of the park. Cory's drumming is first rate too.8). A (And coming VERY close to an A+) - Lea Michele (Rachel Berry), Amber Riley (Mercedes), Chord Overstreet (Sam), Dianna Agron (Quinn), and the Glee Cast - Don't Stop - I have literally had this song on repeat for about 5 plays now. Infectious beat, the same GREAT singing we're used to from Glee, coupled with one of the best Fleetwood Mac songs ever written. Plus, ANYTHING Glee does with the title Don't Stop is destined to come out good right? LOL9). A+ - Lea Michele (Rachel Berry) and Jonathan Groff (Jesse St. James) - Rolling In The Deep - This is a heart thumping powerhouse ballad that Adele just KILLS! (Plus sized sistas rule the world!) And Lea and Jonathan, with the sparks they have from their real life friendship, just burn this one down. Soooo powerful! However, I noticed they did NOT bleep out the curse word in the song, not even on the live broadcast. Interesting. LOL10). A- - Kevin McHale (Artie) - Isn't She Lovely - This is one of the sweetest songs on the album, and it was certainly a beautiful moment on the show. Kevin sounds amazing even without the music, and this is a great interpretation of a classic. A little odd that this is originally about a baby, but hey... Still great! LOL11). Amber Riley (Mercedes) and Naya Rivera (Santana) - Dancing Queen - This song has always been one of my favorite songs for years. And WHAT is it about Amber and Naya that makes them go so great together!? Really takes me back, and the ladies sound amazing.12). A - Amber Riley (Mercedes) - Try A Little Tenderness - Amber Riley can SING!!! She blows this song UP, like she's in church. And I love what her character said about feeling her songs, and singing them with emotions. They certainly are powerful.13). A - Lea Michele (Rachel Berry) - My Man - Lea gets yet another chance to absolutely master big theater number songs. She sings with such power and emotion. If you haven't see her performance of this that was in the show, then by all means, do. I couldn't help but cry. She is one amazing singer, that's for sure. I believe Ryan Murphy called her a once in a generation voice... Indeed!14). A- - Cory Monteith (Finn), Kevin McHale (Artie), Chris Colfer (Kurt), and Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina Cohen Chang) - Pure Imagination - Not my favorite song, but they sing it with breathtaking beauty. Not to mention, that episode of Glee was only the second to completely unhinge my emotions. SUCH a powerful episode, and this song was used to perfection.15). B+ -  Kevin McHale (Artie), Mark Salling (Puck), Chord Overstreet (Sam) - Bella Notte - Of all the songs on the album, this was my least favorite. It's sung beautifully, I just don't care for the beat or tune of the song. I imagine it's a great romance scene in the season finale.16). A++ - Charice (Sunshine Corazon) and Vocal Adrenaline - As Long As You're There - This is another of Glee's original songs, and it's one you have to hear to believe. I've been a fan of Charice for a long while now, and this song is easily one of her best. She hits notes that are just inhuman in their power. For someone so little, she can stun anything with ears. LOL!17). A++ - Lea Michele (Rachel Berry) and Cory Monteith (Finn) - Pretending - This is another one of my absolute favorite songs from the show. Not just for this album, but of the entire series. This is a Glee original song, and Lea and Michele make an absolutely amazing duet out of it. So good that it goes beyond A+.18). A+ - Lea Michele (Rachel Berry), Naya Rivera (Santana), Cory Monteith (Finn), Kevin McHale, and the Glee Cast - Light Up The World - This will probably be the big club thumper song, and it is yet another of this album's original Glee songs. It was written by Max Martin, who has made stars of quite a few people, and hit songs that number too many to count. It has such great energy, and if I weren't handicapped, I'd be up and dancing. *Bust's a move from the waist up!*  So alright folks, that's my $.02 about Glee: The Music, Volume 6. I give the overall album a solid A+. It has only one song that ranks below an A-, but quite a few songs that are graded considerably higher than an A+. VERY few albums can I put in and listen to all the way through without needing to skip songs. But this one is great from the very first song, right to the last. For all you non-Gleeks, give this album a try. Even if you're not a fan of the show, these guys and gals can sing any genre of music and sound great doing it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Gleeks of the world, unite!!!  Thanks so much for your time folks.  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell\n", "val": 0.028288686648011208}

{"text": "If you like Glee you will love this disc. If you've heard Glee cast songs before you already know they are ALWAYS good.  If you haven't watched Glee or haven't heard a Glee Cast version of a song let me recommend you try some and this album might as well be your introduction.  The 18 songs cover a wide array of genres and feature several guest artists besides the core of a dozen very talented young vocalists.Lea Michele is the star.  She is ultra talented and shows her flexibility on this disc.  Michele has 2 solos, 3 duets and her voice can be distinguished in at least 2 other tracks.  Her cast mate, Naya Rivera does a haunting rendition of \"Songbird\" backed by a lone piano.  If you close your eyes you swear you are in the room with her.  Guest stars include Gwyneth Paltrow, Kristin Chenoweth and Filipino pop star Charice.Many of the songs Glee does are near duplicates of the original artist's rendition.  Others are fresh and sometimes very different interpretations of well known numbers.  You'll find both kinds on this disc.  Glee is known for their song \"mash ups,\" the blending of two or more song and this album has a great one featuring two dynamic female voices, Michele and Dianna Agron.If you have never heard a Glee song I am almost sure you will be impressed.  It is easy to dismiss Glee music as overproduced, trite pop music.  Listen closely and you will find an assortment of voices of such quality, diversity and compatibility that has seldom, if ever, been brought together.  These voices are expertly blended and caressed by the arrangements and equally talented musicians.  Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.03394310548901558}

{"text": "Glee's CDs have ranged from amazing to just okay. This one is definitely amazing. I love about every song on here and am amazed at the quality of the vocals. Gweneth starts this CD off not with a bang, but a beautiful and heart breaking version of Turning Tables. After this the songs range from fast and fun, to slow and jazzy. My personal favorite is I Feel Pretty/Unpretty mash up that combines the amazing power and ability of Lea Michele's voice with the irresistibly adorable and pleasant voice of Dianna Agron. I was also simply blown out of the water of Lea Michele's My Man, which is practically a spot on duplicate of Barbra Streisand's version from Funny Girl. I am not the biggest Barbra fan, but you cannot deny her amazing vocals and Lea Michele does this song justice. I must say I don't like Amber Riley's version of Try A Little Tenderness. It was just a little to angry for that song, but she still has an amazing voice. Kristin Chenoweth comes back to give another amazing song to the mix with Dreams, a duet with Matthew Morrison. I do not like Born This Way, though I did like it more than the original. If you are a Gaga fan, you will love it. I am not, but I do like several of her songs. This one just seems to fall short. With this CD, I have to say the one song I was excited most about and was disappointed by was Rolling In The Deep by Adele. Lea Michele sounds amazing in it and Jonathan Groff brings a great rock feel to it, but the corus lacks without music and the background choir. If I hadn't heard Adele's, this would probably be amazing, but just isn't quite up to par. The rest of the songs I felt were a great mix and I liked them all. Hope this helps. This is my favorite Glee CD since volume 3.\n", "val": 0.005393062252551317}
{"text": "Glee has become a reliable and predictable machine in the pop music productivity factory, which also means that the music tends to be reliably decent. I'm glad that the Nationals edition of the series has taken another turn towards Broadway, one of thew show's aspects I've found endearing. Along with three originals written for the cast, Volume 6 is the most diverse disc of the second season's offerings.This disc encompasses the Fleetwood Mac episode, with \"\"Dreams,\" \"Don't Stop,\" \"Go Your Own Way\" and \"Songbird.\" (It also propelled the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rumours/dp/B000002KGT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rumours</a>&nbsp;album to rechart at #11...how cool was that?) Gwyneth Paltrow, Christine Chenweth and Charice take their guest appearances and make standout appearances on Adele's \"Turning Tables,\" Mac's \"Dreams\" and the new song (and the best of the three originals) \"As Long As Your There,\" respectively. Speaking of Adele, Jonathan Groff (who was wasted in this season with an inconsequential part) does a dynamic return, pairing up with Rachel (Lea Michelle) for \"Rolling In The Deep.\" While it doesn't out-do the original, it was a great pairing. The same can be said for Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way,\" which is as perfect a pop song as you'll hear this year. The gang gets it right, because the song's message and exuberance would be near impossible to botch.Still, it is the Broadway/Movie music that fairs the best. Curt (Chris Colfer) lets loose on \"As If We Never Said Goodbye\" (from \"Sunset Blvd), Rachel lets her Streisand out with \"My Man\" and a light-hearted \"Bella Note\" (from Disney's \"Lady And The Tramp\") now makes me wonder if a Disney tribute would be outside the show's realm of episode probabilities. Lastly, it was the New Directions' covering \"Pure Imagination\" that was this season's bona fide tearjerker. Along with Kenny Loggins' cover, the Glee version now is my favorite recording of that song.\n", "val": 0.013753029517829418}

And everyone who is raving about it seems to have glazed over what I feel is a completely GLARING OMISSION.  I mean am I the only one who watched the show?  The other songs were great and I would put the duet of \"I feel pretty/Unpretty\" right at the top of my list of songs from this album, but come on, I understand they have to leave songs out in order to create an album but we get all the shabby fleetwood mac remixs but not the very well done performance of the Wicked song on the Wicked stage?!?

{"text": "this is a CD set I was sent by a vendor (here on Amazon) by mistake and then asked to keep rather than go through the hassle of returning. Now, my first exposure to L.Fabian's music was when I watched an Eurovision show (1988 I believe it was). Her song there made no lasting impression on me though I did not mind it. Turned out she didn't win that contest - Celine Dion won it with a song just as forgettable (I thought). Anyway, over the years Fabian did grow on me while Dion (with whom Fabian is often compared !?) did not. So, I cannot call myself a big fan of Fabian, but perhaps a moderate fan. Nevertheless, don't let that fool you: in terms of voice quality Lara Fabian is one of the greatest singers of her generation (or perhaps I should say: of our times). In this respect, a most striking quality of her voice is an astounding vocal range which (I'm guessing) spans three-four octaves (listen for instance to \"Tout\" for a sample).With this preamble, let's now return to this 2CD compilation: the songs included here are gathered from her studio albums (and some live shows) spanning the 1991 to 2010 time frame so there are quite a few gems: Demain N'existe Pas, Toccami, Toutes les Femmes en Moi, The Dream Within (some may be familiar with this from the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within animated movie), La Difference, J'y Crois Encore, Tout, Dire, etc., ... and yes, she can sing (very, very well) in may languages (French, English, Italian, etc.) For those who may be curious, her entry (Croire) at the Eurovision is included here as well. The cover art - she shows some skin there - completely unnecessary at a first glance, but maybe that has something to do with the fact that this compilation includes quite a few songs from her 2001 album Nue (Naked). Not too terrible though and overall the quality of the presentation is fine.On to the technical: this compilation was released in 2010 through some Russian subsidiary of Polydor and was well recorded: no clipping, minimal noise, and good dynamic range. The master source used must have also been of good quality. No complaints here. All in all, a great introduction to Lara Fabian for any casual fan. Highly, very highly recommended - 5 star.\n", "val": 0.001239568809978664}

With unbridled passion, a vocal line like silk, and pure sonic brilliance, she reveals the true soul of a very rare and truly unique artist.We are lucky to occupy this planet at a time that lets us enjoy and appreciate her amazing talents. She generously communicates through these abundant gifts with a style and elegance of grace that come along once in a millennium.Lara Fabian writes and sings glorious melodies with extraordinary lyrics.She performs with an intense and uncompromising desire to make one feel the emotions she feels as she sings. She sings to you not at you.She is not preoccupied with the overdone, meaningless, self absorbed demonstrations of vocal gymnastics that have become the trademark of so many other generic entertainers.She has the face of an angel, and a smile so warm and brilliant that it could light up an entire city!She speaks to you between songs with a genuine and totally natural manor that make you feel the comfort, sincerity, and honesty of a true friend.To describe her in one word? Exquisite!!!!!!!\n", "val": 0.04379254952073097}

{"text": "Discovering Frank by accident a few months back, I got familiar with some of these tracks through his impromptu performances uploaded to YouTube (which were filmed on an offshore drilling rig - so yes, he really may be a Gulf Coast Cowboy). It was enough to pique my interest so I bought this album as soon as it was available (back when it was only available on CD from his personal website) and I have really enjoyed the experience. Its a nice change of pace from the stuff they play on popular country radio - Foster stays true to his Rowdy Reputation. Stand out tracks include \"Good Enough For Me\", \"Rowdy Reputation\", \"Gulf Coast Cowboy\", \"Whiskey on the House\", and \"Takin You\". But to me the true gem on this album is the track \"Dirt Road\", which is a catchy and touching tribute to dad, mom and the small town Louisiana back roads where Foster grew up. There are parts that feel under-produced, but they are infrequent and some of that is expected as this is a self released album. Overall this is a solid offering.\n", "val": 0.025953000411391258}

But I have heard enough of this to provide a decent review.The good points about this product is that I got what I wanted.  A few minutes in, and I really do feel mentally in sync with the sounds.  Most of the \"songs\" are about 10 minutes long.  The different frequencies of sound mixed with the title of the songs seem to be what the song intended for.  Ambient sounds seem to be sort of an abstract sort of art, so the only way to tell if this album is the right choice is really up to the listener.As for me, sadly, this album didn't quite fit.  Yes, the songs can assist in getting me to a meditative state, but I couldn't find myself agreeing with the \"style\".  I even found the sounds to be a bit too electronic and \"ringy\".  I've heard other ambient sounds of this nature, and this mainly stayed on the higher pitches and bell sounds while I would have appreciated a bit more of a hum.I'm sure even in the ambient sound community, there is bad ambient and good ambient.  This album for me lay sort of in the 4-star rating of ambient sounds.  It just didn't quite fit my preference, I guess.  I'd give it a 3.5 which rounds to a 4.\n", "val": 0.0002806406992021948}

Even a whistled section is off-key, for pete's sake!  Graham Parker and Kate Pierson have done some great work, but this is not it. Their voices are off-key, weak, and gritty.  The production sounds like a matter of fact, portable digital-4track-whatever-is-recorded-we'll-use. . .To paraphrase an old classical music joke:  Parker, Pierson and Janovitz played McCartney today. . . .McCartney lost.David Hartman\n", "val": 3.050894883926958e-05}
{"text": "I love Beatle cover records and I am a huge fan of the B-52's and Kate Pierson so I was really excited to hear about this release.  As Beatles cover compilations go this one is above average.  It is a really pleasant romp through some of the lost songs in the Lennon and McCartney catalog.Kate Pierson singing \"I'm In Love\" sounds is very B-52ish.  Bill Janovitz's take on \"I'll Keep You Satisfied\"lacks the pop sweetness of the Billy J. Kramer version which is the essence of this song's charm.  \"From A Window\" by Graham Parker has an instrumental backing that sounds like the Hollie.  This is one of the really great lost Lennon and McCartney songs.\"Step Inside Love\" features Kate Pierson and Johnny Society with Kate also doing background vocals.  This is fun but doesn't hold a candle to the Cilla Black version.  \"It's For You\" by Bill Janovitz is one of the outstanding tracks on this CD.  He sounds like Elvis Costello on this.  \"Bad To Me\" performed by Graham Parker is fun.  This is another one of the real gems among the lost songs but I prefer the Billy J. Kramer version.\"That Means A Lot\" performed by Johnny Society and Robin Zander features a really strong vocal performance.  This one of the real standout songs on this release.On \"Hello Little Girl\" by Bill Janovitz he does the impossible: he takes one of the least memorable songs ever written by Lennon and McCartney and turns it into a gem.  He does this as a new wave rave a la Elvis Costello and the Attractions in the early days when they were making listenable music.  This is fun, snappy, and completely blows away the version by the Fourmost.\"Love of the Loved\" by Kate Pierson has a jazzy instrumental backing, but lacks the essential sparkle of the Cilla Black version.  \"Tip Of My Tongue\" by Graham Parker is given a reggae flavor.  This would have been more fun if it had been done at snappier tempo.  \"Goodbye\" by Bill Janovitz is one of the best songs that Lennon and McCartney gave away.  This is a great performance of a great song.\"Come and Get It\" was the most memorable song ever done by Badfinger.  Graham Parker's version is fun, but doesn't come close to the Badfinger recording.  \"World Without Love\" by Bill Janovitz has a bluesy feeling with a great harmonica instrumental break in the middle.\"One And One Is Two\" by Graham Parker is an upbeat rocker.I love Kate Pierson but her stripped down version of \"Nobody I Know\" just goes to show how turly brilliant the Peter and Gordon recording truly is.  \"Woman\" by Bill Janovitz has a simple arrangement featuring a wonderful vocal.\"I'll Be On My Way\" by Johnny Society is another great lost song.  This is done Buddy Holly style and the arrangement is brilliant but I would have loved it if they had added a slide guitar break in the middle.This is a really fun, solid release.  I would highly recommend it to fans of Kate Pierson or Graham Parker and to collectors of Beatles covers.  These songs are essential to any true collection of Beatles tunes but any one who doesn't have the original versions should seek them out.\n", "val": 0.013971912674605846}
{"text": "Matthew Morrison is one supremely talented guy.  Amazing voice, great dancer, a terrific all-around entertainer.  I've been eagerly anticipating this debut solo release since it was first announced last year.I'm not very impressed.  Not that it's a bad album; it's just that it seems to be trying to prove a couple of points -- namely, that Matthew Morrison is NOT Will Schuester, nor is he just another pretty Broadway face.  We get it.  Point taken.This album falls into a category that used to be called MOR (\"middle of the road\"), walking a line between glossy pop music and more serious adult-contemporary singer/songwriter-ish fare.  This gives the album a bit of a lack of focus; while artists like Michael Bubl have been able to successfully navigate similar waters, Morrison just seems randomly adrift on the open sea.I have a few complaints about the production, the main one being the way Morrison's vocals often get buried in the mix.  I suppose I was expecting an album that showcased his vocal talent in a more obvious way, but instead we got some pretty bland pop songs in which the vocals could have been provided by just about anyone.  The true \"pop\" songs on the album are also completely vacuous when it comes to lyrics.  It seems that Morrison didn't take Will Schuester's advice about choosing songs that SAY something meaningful about yourself or your feelings.To stop being negative for a moment, let's talk about the album's high points.  \"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters/Rocket Man,\" a duet with Elton John, is fantastic.  These are classic songs that have withstood the test of time.  \"Over the Rainbow\" with Gwyneth Paltrow is another strong song, although it's not a lot different from the version used in GLEE at the end of season one.  \"It's Over\" is probably my favorite song from the album, having very sparse instrumentation backing it and featuring Morrison's vocals prominently.Making it all the more frustrating is the fact that this album has been released in a number of different versions, with different bonus tracks appearing on the Amazon, iTunes and Barnes & Noble versions of the album.  I purchased both the Amazon and iTunes versions, and I'll admit I prefer the bonus track from the iTunes version (\"A Boy Can Dream\") over the Amazon bonus track (\"Arms of a Woman\").  However, Amazon's version can be purchased as an actual CD, so for us old folks who like to have a hard-copy backup of all our music, we can get a real CD to hold in our hands here.Ultimately, if you're a Matthew Morrison or GLEE fan, you'll want this album.  Just don't set your expectations too high, as I did.  I'm sure, in the grand scheme of things, I'll be playing Morrison's songs from GLEE more than the songs from this album, but I certainly don't regret buying it (twice!).\n", "val": 5.907194645260461e-05}

Matthew has such a warm caramel tenor and hits the high notes with ease.  He is obviously a romantic soul who isn't afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve.

{"text": "As the Glee 'kids' gear up for their summer tour, Matthew Morrison has been hard at work on his own project, which is this album that you either hold in your hands or downloaded. The album itself is filled with a great mix of music, from older classics, to songs Matthew Morrison wrote himself, to duets with some of the greatest people in the business. And the end result, honestly, is absolutely 'Gleeful'. Even the insert and photos came out great. And so without further ado, I give you my review of Matthew Morrison's self titled debut...1). A- - Matthew Morrison - Summer Rain - Such a smooth slow jam, at the same time refreshing but also sounding like the music of years gone by. The lyrics however, written by Matthew Morrison, are completely modern. The song is about a former lover (He confirmed that on Ryan Seacrest.) that he made love with on a rooftop during a storm in New York. His vocals are amazing, and the beat throws you off a bit at first, but quickly has you tapping your toes.2). A - Matthew Morrison - Still Got Tonight - This is BEAUTIFUL ballad about a long distance relationship, or a relationship with someone who has to travel a lot with his work. And you just get that true sense of honesty and legitimacy, and you just know this is something he's lived through. Not surprising since he's an actor. I'm starting to think it's not possible for him to sound bad. He could sing the phone book to a decent beat and we'd buy it. LOL3). B - Matthew Morrison and Sting - Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot - I've never been a fan of Sting. (Ducks all the rocks and garbage and tomatoes thrown at him.) LOL But they sound really good together, and the message of the song is a good one. Not my favorite song on the album, but still pretty darn good.4). A- - Matthew Morrison - My Name - This is clearly another very personal song for Matthew Morrison. I could be wrong, but it seems to me as if it's a song about a person with a career in show business, and while he's surrounded by people, they don't know the real him, and he's still alone either way. He sounds so haunted.5). A- - Matthew Morrison - Hey - This is a nice up tempo song about being too shy or nervous to say 'Hey' to someone you have feelings for. We've all been there, and Matthew gives voice to it nicely.6). A- - Matthew Morrison and Gwyneth Paltrow - Somewhere Over The Rainbow - One of the most beautiful songs on the album. Not sure what it is about Will and Holly... err... Matthew and Gwyneth... LOL Their voices just go together beautifully.7). A - Matthew Morrison - Don't Stop Dancing - Man, Glee fans are going to LOVE this song. GREAT dance jam, and I gotta say, I'm impressed. I can TOTALLY hear this in a club. In fact, I predict it will be in every gay bar across the globe by Friday night. LOL Great song!8). A - Matthew Morrison - It Don't Matter To The Sun - This is a BEAUTIFUL song about how life goes on, no matter how badly it feels like our worlds are coming to an end when someone leaves us. The world just keeps on turning. This was the first song I cried to on the album.9). A- - Matthew Morrison and Elton John - Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters/Rocket Man - Elton John! What more needs to be said! He and Matthew's voices are perfectly complimentary. Beautiful 'Mash-Up' of classic hits.10). B+ - Matthew Morrison - It's Over - A soft, haunting break up song. Matthew's voice is great, but the music is very... hmm, dated sounding? Sounds like a song from another generation. Still really beautiful, and the strings are fantastic. Another self written song that is clearly personal to him.11). B+ - Matthew Morrison - Arms Of A Woman (Amazon Exclusive Track) - The more of these heartbreaking songs I hear, I can't help but wonder how many times he's been hurt. They are sung with so much heartache and pain. Thoroughly depressing, and yet brilliant at the same time. LOL  So okay folks, there's my two cents on the self titled Matthew Morrison album. Overall, I give the album an A- grade. Several songs score even higher than that, and all together it's an album I can listen to from front to back without skipping any songs, and that's VERY rare for me. He did and amazing job on his solo project, showing that he's got so much more to give than just being Will Shuester on Glee. If you're a fan of Glee, and of Matthew Morrison especially, then this is a must have album. No rapping on it, I swear. LOL I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Thanks so much for your time folks.  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell\n", "val": 0.03407948836684227}
{"text": "Anyone who's seen Glee or seen him on Broadway knows Matthew Morrison is multi-talented (the producer of Glee said it best, \"You'd think there are a lot of good-looking 30 year old guys on Broadway who can act, sing and dance well but there really aren't.\") He has performed some show stoppers from time to time on \"Glee\", but I still wondered if he could carry his own album.The answer to that is, \"Fortunately, we don't have to know the answer, as this has several duets--all strong--including with Sting, Gwenneth Paltrow and Elton John.\" So, how does he do?I wondered a bit at first about the song selection--am guessing they were mainly chosen to keep a bit of an introspective feeling and, most of all, showcase Morrison's vocal range. For that, they work, but personally I would have replaced half of them with songs with stronger lyrics and greater popularity (then again, some are -very- familiar, which is ambitious in itself. Really, \"Over the Rainbow\" is difficult, even as a duet, because we've heard it so often.) I'm not quite sure what age group this is aimed at--seems too old for 20's/30's pop, not jazzy, not nostalgic enough for Boomer Pop. It's a little bland, but not in an atmospheric way. But...I don't want to sound harsh, because I do enjoy it and may just be frustrated that I'd love to hear him on some of my own favorite songs.I think the mashup of \"Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters/Rocket Man\" (which has enough of each song to be considered singing two songs, in my opinion) shows some of Morrison's strengths as a vocalist--he's dueting with Elton John and holds his own very well. He doesn't wimp out on the difficult notes--he's got vocal range and a nice tone--shows confidence that he can reach them and deliver--and he and John really blend well as a duet. (Unlike so many of these \"duets\" which are really recorded separately then mixed electronically in-studio, John and Morrison actually recorded together, with JOhn on piano).My only little quibble is that his phrasing is so much like the original Elton recording, including the breath control on the sustained notes, and he's singing with Elton John, who comes in powerfully on every verse like the master he is. Morrison acquits himself commendably, but the duet also reminds the listener he isn't John's vocal equal (not surprising, I know, but that's the pressure of dueting with Elton JOhn.) Considering the challenge, he did well. More to the point, the song really works as a mashup and they both bring a really nice energy to it that makes it different from all the other versions you've heard dozens of times.I'd definitely recommend this album, and Morrison as a singer. His GLEE fans will enjoy it, and I think so will people who have no idea who \"Mr. Schue\" is.\n", "val": 0.0022558686323463917}
{"text": "I wanted to love this CD; I really did, because I love Morrison's singing on Glee. But this? The \"original\" songs are so . . . well, bland is kind. Singing about a one night stand having sex on the rooftop in the rain is not going to make musical history. Good songs can make or break an album and I think this one broke because the songs simply aren't substantive or worthy of future cover. I'm beginning to fear Morrison has bad judgement about his musical choices - his appearance on the Capitol 4th of July PBS concert special was so off the mark as to be embarrassing. He chose a song totally inappropriate to the occasion (yes, one of those unmemorable originals). He left a jazzed, receptive audience bewildered. He couldn't figure out the occasion itself called for a strong show stopper? In contrast his duet with Kelli O'Hara doing \"Tonight,\" was stellar. People started swaying. A recognizable song with 2 strong voices. You'd think he would choose wiser for his solo for such a momentous occasion and historic venue than a lightweight totally unknown love song. On this CD, the duets are far better than the solos. I still am not sure whether its the paltry material chosen for the solos, or whether Morrison's voice itself is more suited to duets than solos. I guess his second CD, whenever it comes out, will provide the answer. Morrison's talent is above average but this CD is merely average. If he can match his material with his talent, future CDs might get played more than once.\n", "val": 7.948317215777934e-05}

{"text": "From what I've read in the reviews, opinions about this release are pretty mixed.I guess it all depends on what you expect, and whether it was delivered.I first heard Morrison on the Broadway cast recording of Hairspray. Bought it in 2007, and had no idea who he was at the time. But his voice was so distinctive and beautiful that I immediately checked the CD insert for his name. You can imagine how happy I was when he was cast in Glee. ( Same thing happened with fellow Glee cast-mates Lea Michele and Jonathan Groff, who blew me away on the Spring Awakening album. ):)Some people may not like the fact that the songs on this album span a rather wide range of genres, from ballads to pop to dance and slow rock. But considering Morrison's obvious versatility on Glee, where he effortlessly covers everything from Broadway classics to hip-hop, this format shouldn't really surprise anyone.The release highlights his talent further, but there're definitely a number of standout tracks, especially the excellent duets.Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot with Sting is terrific, complete with choir backup. I own many Sting albums, and this version is better than most!Somewhere Over The Rainbow with Gwyneth Paltrow features a beautiful opening that leads into the main song, a pop confection that's different from the Glee version, and totally refreshing.Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters / Rocket Man with Elton John is easily one of the best on the CD. I've never really liked Rocket Man, but this update is fantastic!The rest of the album will please Morrison fans, myself included. Summer Rain and Hey are radio-friendly and uptempo, while It Don't Matter To The Sun and It's Over showcase his brilliant vibrato wonderfully.Will we have to wait another year or two for his next collection? Let's hope not - there's always the option of a Christmas CD. :)\n", "val": 0.05349873751401901}

It has that happy flowing sound we need during the hot months.  A sing along car song, with or without friends.  Impressive that he is the primary writer, even though this song is about the music, not the lyric.\"Still Got Tonight\" has a slow build to an invigorating loud anthem, and goes up and down. To be performed live would be a show of his vocal power. The song needs to be rocked out, and it really sounds like something Kelly Clarkson would do well with.  Oddly enough, it is co-written by American Idol, Kris Allen.\"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\", a duet with Sting, on a Sting song. I always heard Sting's version as Gospel, and this version really brings that sound out. The arrangement of the choir and the horns is spot-on. An interesting inspirational effort.\"My Name\".... screeeech. This is my only roadblock. First, it should be called \"Turn The Lights Off\".  But there seems to be some undeserved arrogance here.  He wrote it, but even if he didn't, the lyrics are a bit too soon for his life. He is basically telling his fans that we think he is a god-like mega-celeb or something. Maybe he does have screaming 13 year old girls thinking he is something he is not, but the people who love this music are not going to be the people this song is about.  It's a notable lyrical effort, but too soon.\"Hey\", another floaty summer song while riding in a convertible. Mostly written by Mr. Morrison, but if you wondering why it reminds you of an N'Sync song when he starts the \"Hey Hey\" part, that's probably due to the contribution of JC Chasez. But it's all good.  This song was a very wise choice to add because artists do not always think about the music they record becomes part of their life forever. They may be stuck singing the same songs due to demand. Well, this is the perfect audience interaction song, as we would be the ones singing the \"Hey Hey\" part as he points the mike to us.\"(Somewhere) Over The Rainbow\" as a duet with Gwyneth Paltrow, starts out sweet and harmonic, but then turns into the over-saturated Israel \"IZ\" Kamakawiwo'ole version copied by everyone and their ukelele. There is nothing wrong with the song, it sounds wonderful as a soft ballad, but I really wish he went with more of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sam-Harris-version/dp/B000ZNZ2XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sam Harris version</a>. However, Gwyneth does not have the vocal range. But, still enjoyable, and proving this album was released at the perfect time... Summer!\"Don't Stop Dancing\" is one of those misfit tracks I spoke of earlier. A heavy dance beat and kinda disrupts the album's emotion.  On the positive side, it's a great song, but once again, we're back in N'Sync mode here with a touch of JC Chasez contributing again. A great mix of his falsetto too. Nothing wrong with it, it just comes out of nowhere!\"It Don't Matter To The Sun\" a beautiful soulful, heartfelt ballad. Probably the best representation of his voice. A message of dedicated love exclaiming the world would go on without his lover, but he will not.\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters / Rocket Man\" medley duet with Elton John.  A fresh take on Elton's classics, and Elton is top form vocally. You feel Matthew's heart in this collaboration, and I would imagine he could not believe it was actually happening. You wonder how they could mix the two songs together, but in a nod to Glee in mash-ups, it works rather well. The mix makes it much more interesting than just covering either song that countless people have done. But not many can say they did it with the original artist.  Kudos.\"It's Over\" Matthew co-writes with the brilliant Marc Shaiman.  Marc is mostly known for movie soundtracks, and comedic songs. From \"Blame Canada\" to \"It's Over\" is quite a range of work, but the song is short, simple, sweet, and sad. As it should be. A song of heartache delivered without drama. Lovely.\"Arms Of A Woman\" (Amazon exclusive track)... if you are trying to choose which edition to get, this is the one.  This is a great cover of an early Amos Lee track.  Just Matthew and a guitar. A great bonus with superb vocal and emotional delivery.I give the album 5 stars because I keep playing it, and look forward to more from Matthew in the near future.\n", "val": 0.017659256234765053}

Songwriting is not his forte. The lyrics to the songs written by him seem like they were written by or for a bunch of pre-teens. They're as deep as a mud puddle in a desert. I found myself nearly gagging at many of the terrible lyrics, forced rhymes, and overdone metaphors. I listened to the entire album twice just to make sure I really hated it. It was difficult to actually get through to the end of many songs.This is an album that may appeal to tweens and teens, and the occasional fan of Glee, but I say steer clear if you like your music a little more mature. Oh, and Matthew (re: My Name), please get over yourself. You're in show business for goodness sake; what did you expect when you hit it big? I simply cannot listen to another famous actor or singer complain about what a pain fame is. Poor thing!\n", "val": 6.959161692066118e-05}

{"text": "My review focuses on Somewhere Over The Rainbow, a timeless jazz classic. This is a decent attempt at this beautiful but difficult song. Matthew has a great voice, and there is no doubt he can handle such a challenging piece but overall he falls a bit flat this time. The arrangement and the instrumentals are based on the classic Israel Kamakawiwo'ole recording, and for the most part they make Matthew sound better than he is. There is some real emotion in there. However, the sappy violins in the duet verses are badly engineered and way too loud. Perhaps they cover up some vocal flaws but I would much rather have heard a little more raw heart-felt vocals. Anyway Gwyneth Paltrow is workman-like, does a nice job. The big letdown is the final chorus. I know Matthew is no IZ, but it sounds like he didn't even try. Anti-climatic. Nevertheless it's a good effort and you won't be wasting your time listening to this.\n", "val": 0.0006558735040016472}
{"text": "Well done, Matthew!  I've had a couple of days to play this album now and I am so glad I bought it.  Matthew Morrison is incredibly talented and passionate about creating music.  The original songs are written well and express a good depth of feeling.  It also shows Matthew's versatility as an artist.  One of the best songs, in my opinion, is \"Still Got Tonight\".I am giving this album 5 stars because it shines in many ways, but I do have a couple of points that I think could have been better.As an artist, I think the album photography could have been a little better.  It \"feels\" dated.Also, I understand the pairing of Matthew and Gwyneth from their roles on Glee,  but I don't think her voice is a truly good match for Matthew's in a duet.  Hers is a deep alto and a little flat, and it's just not that fitting for his beautiful tenor, which gets a little lost in the song.  It seems like her alto takes the lead and it should be the other way around.Overall this is a wonderful debut and I can't wait to see what Matthew does in the future. When I listen to this album, I think it would be awesome to have a guy like Matthew in your circle of friends. Hopefully I will get to hear these songs live at the Palace Theater in Columbus, Ohio on tour.\n", "val": 0.018677696585655212}

Why then, did he choose to do an album of pablum for the GLEE crowd? Of yea, because it sells. Well, I am one fan who wishes that he had used his amazing voice to rekindle the love for real singing. Not the breathy, digitized vocals that have become a bankable trademark, but real singing. Listen, I know I'm in the minority. Honestly I do. But as someone with an almost religious respect for talent, this CD left me wishing that some producer hadn't gotten to him first. GLEE is a product. He is a star.

As he contributes to writing some of these songs, there is an eerie resemblance of old school Sammy Davis Jr/Frank Sinatra and modern flavor of Amos Lee. It is a rollercoaster of fun dance songs, lovely ballads and sensational duets with Gywenth Paltrow, Sting and Sir Elton John.My favorite song is \"My Name,\" which battles to the duality of who he is as a person and his character of Mr. Schuester on Fox's hit \"Glee.\" The song pulls you in the emotional longing for people to see the real you.

This is Elegant progressive metal, everything clean, everything perfect, from the album cover to the bass lines to the drum fills to the clean guitars.

{"text": "5 Stars -  This Cd should have catapulted FW to the moon. For the price, the making of DVD is worth it alone.I have not written a review in some time but had to after re-re discovering this gem from 1991.This edition comes with the remastered CD (featuring all 8 masterpieces), a live CD set  recored on 1/23/92 in Hollywood, Ca, and a DVD.  The DVD features the making of parallels doc, 2 videos, and a live show filmed on 2/13/92 in New Haven Ct.quick CD overview:It is remastered and that could be good or bad, I think it is good in this case although the original sounded great as well.  You can really hear all the cymbals and there are a lot of them way out in front.  Jim Matheos's textures and tones sound better than ever.  This sounds like it was released today and not in 1991.Track by track-Leave the past behind - Sounds great with the immediate impact of the rhythm section of Mark Zonder and Bpnes.  The idea, forget what you know about Fates Warning up to now, lets move on to something new (Progressive Metal as it would eventually be named).Life in Still Water - One of the heaviest songs on he CD.  Still a live staple.Eye to Eye - The closest thing to a pop song that FW can do, and I defy you to not sing along to it.  Actually got a fair bit of radio and video play.the eleventh hour - absolute gem in the FW catalogue.  I won't describe it hear because  I want you to buy the CD to hear it.  I may even suggest that it gave Dream Theater the idea that long songs were cool if at a high quality.point of view - another sing along and though provoking. This one also has a video.we only say goodbye - to that point, the only actual Fates love song according to Jim in the DVD and a favorite of the record label co-head.  I like to sing along to this one as well.don't follow me - another one I like to sing along to (Ray Alder is actually my favorite singer).  I just realized that we just completed a sing along suite.the road goes on forever - an absolutely beautiful song in atmosphere and depth.  Listen to this with headphones.So as a whole this just synergy.  It sounds great with the legendary Terry Brown (of Rush fame) producing.  The drumming sounds like nothing you hear anywhere from Mark Zonder. He would expand on it with monument on the next CD inside out, but any aspiring drummer must own this work.  The textures are great as you hear new things each time. Jim Matheos's song writing is though provoking and textured.  The attention to detail that he has is worth it. You can tell that they spent a lot of time on this and the DVd highlighting the making of is a can't miss.  Any fan of this CD who have already bought this have to buy it again.  I did and I was not disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised.At the time, Fates fans screamed sellout, I didn't see it that way.  I enjoyed this one then and do now.  There is nothing wrong with wanting your music to be heard.  These guys need to make a living you know.  Every song is great and the CD is short.Buy this if a fan of Progressive Metal or just great rock music.\n", "val": 0.011849765665829182}

{"text": "I waited for this album with baited breath--afterall, it is my 2nd favorite Ray Alder-era FATES WARNING album ('Perfect Symmetry' being my 1st)...a re-mastered better sounding album complete with demo versions and LIVE bonus tracks? But wait-it gets better...or worse depending on what you get in the mail. There is a THIRD disc- a live DVD of Fates triumphant 'return home' New Haven CT. gig during the Parallels tour! All for $14? UNREAL. Well, like they say-if it sounds too good to be true, it usually isn't. But it's not the bands fault-or even Amazon's fault. There is a manufacturers DEFECT in which so many of these  digi-pack (hate those anyway) 'fold-out' cardboard sleeve things got GLUE on at least ONE (in my case TWO) of the discs.  My 2nd bonus disc and DVD are unreadable on both my computer, iTunes, and also my dvd player. So I ended up with the same thing I had in 1991-the basic 'Parallels' album (albeit a louder re-mastered edition). I'm still waiting for Amazon to finish their 'investigation' into the manufacturer defect before they will give me a refund. It's been 3 days now and still no refund. Here's hoping Metal Blade owns up to their shoddy packaging and manufacturing problem. I do see that another customer on here had the SAME problem I did-but from a retail store. Amazon is usually pretty good about this type of thing (plus I am a 'Prime' member), so I'm not too worried. Metal Blade Records: shame on YOU.\n", "val": 6.882441812194884e-05}

{"text": "Don't get me wrong; I have been a Fate's fan for over 20 years and have never had a chance to see them perform live, until this special re-release w/dvd and the bonnaroo dvd they released previously but thought that was kind of a fluke due to poor recording techniques. Jim Matheos is a brilliant and thoughtful song writer who's work could have really brought them huge fame and recognition. His tag team lead guitar work with Frank Aresti is mesmorizing. Drummer Mark Zonder and bassist Joe DiBiase are really the heartbeat of the band and Zonder's flawless timing puts him easily alongside greats like Neal Peart, Carl Palmer,et al. The most glaring flaw in their live performances is Ray Alder, who's sometimes can and cannot vocals are distracting, puzzling, and just sometimes awful. I know this is prog metal but had they hired someone like Dio or Joe Lynn Turner, or Jeff Scott Soto, guys who can actually sing as well live as on the record, Fate's would have been catapulted into the limelight. I really believe Ray's live performances are what held them back. And to hear producer Terry Brown's comments regarding Alder's \"diva\" behavior makes his hiring all that more puzzling. The other members of the band seem so dedicated, concerned, and professional that I can only imagine what Matheos was thinking when he hired Alder. The 2nd audio cd, with live performances, has utterly horrendous vocals, with Alder screaming and vocally scraping, almost always off-key, through most every song. He does have the ability to really shine on some of the softer elements like \" The 11th Hour\" or \"The Road Goes On Forever\" but overall, if you've anyone else in the room, they're gonna say \"what the hell is this?\" I'm still a fan of the band as a unit, but I'll stick to the studio version of things.

{"text": "First off, I love this album - it's one of the best albums ever, in my opinion.  A true masterpiece.Now about this special edition:1.  The \"making of Parallels\" documentary was pretty good.  It was interesting to gain some insight into how they produced the album and the challenges they faced.  A few problems with the documentary were the low quality of the interview recordings (especially Frank's) and a bit too much of the live performances throughout the video.  Some questions I was hoping to get answered never were: how did the rest of the band feel about not being part of the writing process?  What happened with Frank Aresti's ideas that he brought with him to the writing sessions?  What were Brian Slagel's thoughts on all the marketing that just stopped all of a sudden on Parallels (the band had thoughts on it, but mysteriously nothing from Mr. Slagel - the CEO of their label!).  Also, the studio footage really only featured Ray Alder and Jim Matheos - just 1 clip of Frank doing a solo nothing with Mark or Joe.  It would have been better to capture all the members, but I understand the footage is quite old and they basically \"have whatever they have\".2.  I was VERY disappointed with the packaging.  First, the artwork and pictures looked like they were scanned copies from the original - the colors are all messed up - if you hold the new booklet up against the old one, it's obvious that the new one is just a copy from the old one.  I'm a huge Hugh Syme fan and it's disappointing to see his imagery represented with lower quality than the original.  I always compare remastered editions to the Marillion remasters - the gold standard of what to do with a remastered edition, in my opinion.  As far as the sound goes, it's a bit louder than the original but I can't really tell the difference otherwise.To to sum up, I was a bit disappointed with this new edition of Parallels.  The documentary is interesting to watch, but that's about all that's truly worthwhile on this release.  Still, I think Parallels is one of the best albums ever and if you don't have it already, you owe it to yourself to pick this up immediately!\n", "val": 0.0008932839846238494}

The songs are more ominous and anthemic, but i think this is to be expected seeing as the cover is similarly eerie-looking and existentialist. However, i don't think this is a bad thing.Personally, I like this Anberlin album better than some of their previous ones (Eg. Never Take Friendship Personal - which is, needless to say, also great) just because the album itself is not only just rock songs anymore but are now rock songs that can create a completely different atmosphere. I can't think of a song on this album that i would skip over, and while the lyrics may not always be on par with their previous albums, i think the way Anberlin delivers them, with passion and such emotion behind it, more than makes up for it. A few lines of lyrics might sound sappy coming out of another band's mouth, but here they just sound gorgeous and authentic.Having seen how dynamic and capable Anberlin, from the more rock-based first few albums, to the more pop/rock New Surrender to this atmospheric \"Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place\", I CANNOT wait to see what Anberlin puts out next.

I do like the strong effort the band put into the album, and maybe this is a new direction the band is heading in; but I do hope they can come back to some of the creativity and musicality that made the previous afore mentioned albums so great.  I do find We Owe This to Ourselves and Impossible very catchy and good listens, but they lack the drive of previous blockbuster songs like \"Godspeed\" and \"Feel Good Drag\" and other softer tracks didn't register with me like previous heartfelt tracks such as \"The unwinding cable car\" and \"Paperthin Hymn\", and lastly the extended final track that has been a staple of all but the first Anberlin album just doesn't come close to ridiculously high level achieved previously, especially the last two connected tracks on Cities.If your not a fan of Anberlin yet, or if you are judging the band based on this album, I highly recommend listening to the album Cities by this group first, to hear this band in its finest hour.

{"text": "There are parts of this record that blew me away. Great hooks, good riffs, haunting melodies and lyrics that convey a deep sense of loss or life gone wrong. I kept trying to figure out what had happened in the lives of the band members for them to write such dark lyrics. I gather someone in the band went through a relationship breakdown?I like that the record is a bit less polished and more aggressive than their last efforts. Its a lot less poppy. I love the delays and spacey sounding guitar effects (well I assume they are guitars, they could be synths for all I know). The album seems to be trying to convey a mood or emotion rather than trying to create another insipid pop song. There is a lot of reverb and delay type effects going, and the sound is truly multi-layered - especially on the song \"You Belong\" - sounds like theres about 6 or 7 lead singers singing the intro part.I wonder if they will succeed in recreating this kind of sound live without the help of vocal processors and the like. As a musician this album appeals to me because I love songs with tonnes of guitar fill ins all over the place. If you're looking for another Cities or New Surrender look elsewhere, this is a new direction for the band. It's not another pop record, its quite original for Anberlin and I for one like it. That doesn't mean the songs aren't memorable. They certainly stuck with me for days after listening to the album.\n", "val": 0.009435881860554218}

This album lives up to all expectations I had for them. As far as I'm concerned it is equal if not better than Blueprints which was tough to beat.

{"text": "A few years ago a friend threw the Anberlin album \"New Surrender\" into his car CD player and I immediately fell in love with this band's music.  The very first song of the album grabbed me immediately and I was blown away by every song on the album.  I made one song my ringtone and bought two copies of my own, one digital to listen at home and the other a cd to leave in my car as the only cd I'd have in there.Later, I needed more Anberlin, so I got my hands on the album \"Cities\" and though I didn't enjoy it quite as much as New Surrender, I still enjoyed it very much.  Anberlin had become one of my favorite bands.I preordered \"Dark Is the Way: Light Is a Place\".  I've listened to the album 3 times and find it hard to even attempt to listen to again.  The intelligent lyrics I'd heard on the other two albums were gone.  I'm not sure if there is a single song where Anberlin doesn't repeat the same line of lyrics over and over repeatedly.  The first song doesn't grab me and I'm utterly disappointed with this album's lyrics and the catchiness of the songs.  There are maybe one or 2 songs I enjoy listening to again, but still have no lyrical excitement to them.  It's almost as if they were hurrying the album to release and said to themselves, \"I have an idea... why don't we just repeat the same line over and over for a verse or chorus in every song.\"  Maybe they have a different writer for their music, but whatever the problem is, needs to be fixed.I won't buy another one of their albums without first hearing the music from it again.

It may only have 10 songs on this cd.

{"text": "I first heard \"Paperthin Hymn\" about five or six years ago, and I was absolutely in love with it by the end of the second chorus. After that, I delved into more of Anberlin's music and I was not disappointed. \"Blueprints\" was fairly solid, NTFP was overall fantastic, with a few blah songs but definitely others that were just amazing (\"Paperthin Hymn\" and \"Dance, Dance Christa Paffgen\" most notably blew my mind) and Cities? I still consider that one of the best albums I own- the lyrics are breathtaking and Stephen Christian's voice is phenomenal. That being said, I'm a huge Anberlin fan- I consider them my favorite band. But I must say, I'm becoming more and more disenchanted with each new release.It's not that New Surrender and Dark is the Way, Light is a Place are horrible albums. Actually, if they were by any other band, I'd be really impressed. But I'm starting to notice a lack of the beautiful, poetic lyrics that originally drew me to this band in the first place. But even New Surrender had some great songs for me to love (at the top of the pile is \"Soft Skeletons\"), while I'm feeling really nothing for this new one.The only song I really honestly like much is \"Down\" (which seems to be a highlight on the album for others as well). I really just can't get into them at all. The fact that there are lyrics such as \"Because of you, I'll never write a love song\" blows my mind- this seems to me to be the fodder of typically pop-punk/emo bands, not Anberlin! The ending track seems rather blah to me- nothing compared to the breathtaking finales Anberlin has delivered with the last three albums.If you don't listen to the lyrics, you'll notice though that musically, this album is an improvement over New Surrender. And of course, Stephen Christian continues to blow me away with his amazing voice- I just wish I could feel something for what he's saying.I'm not sure what to say to tie this up. Overall, I would consider this a great CD if it wasn't Anberlin, but I know they can do better, so I just consider it okay. I can guarantee you that this CD will NOT stay in my constant rotation, and more than likely, none of the songs but \"Down\" will make it to my playlists.\n", "val": 0.0008941912674345076}

The musical composition is less reckless and more professionally delivered. The lyrics are more serious and personal. It still has the classic Anberlin style, but it is has a new feel to it.Out of 10 songs, I love 9 of them. This is rare for any artist/band. So it is not a perfect album, but it is a must buy for any Anberlin fan or someone new to Anberlin. If you are new, try this album first and work your way back through their music. The only thing disappointing about this album is that it's short. After 10 songs, I'm left wanting more.

{"text": "On a good note: the strong hooks that were dominant on Anberlin's 2007 masterpiece \"Cities\" are back for the most part on their new album. 2008's \"New Surrender\" sounded good while it was on, and the lyrics were certainly top-notch. But the songs were not as strong as the material on \"Cities\" and thus it sounded like an album full of b-sides from \"Cities.\"2010's \"Dark is the Way Light is a Place\" is more radio-friendly than anything this band has done before. At ten tracks, it is also their shortest album. The songs are as sweet as sugar, with big sweeping pop hooks and melodic sing-along verses. The problem is that the lyrics have been stripped down to basic sentiments about love, relationships, and soul-searching. So what we have is ten songs that sound as if they were recorded by a more lightweight band who was trying to sound like Anberlin. The production is flawless, and there is not a single bad song on the entire album. But the sound is so similar to modern day Coldplay mixed with some late 1980's U2, that one could literally sing the lyrics to those bands' past hits to some of these songs. I thought at the time \"Cities\" was released, that it would never be topped, and that just might be the case. But Anberlin has a world of talent, and if their next album is a bit riskier and edgier, they might match or exceed all they have previously done. But these ten songs are polished and spit-shined for the masses, and while some may cry \"sellout,\" others might just wonder why they felt the need to so closely emulate other bands.\n", "val": 0.0017885650740936399}

He's backed by a very strong band and instrumental arrangements that mesh perfectly with his voice.This is their fifth recording, and their sound continues to evolve while still being recognizable across all of their albums.  While their 'sound' is consistent - the music and individual songs grow and mature with each recording.  Their music seems richer and fuller with each outing and blends many influences from across the musical spectrum.Anberlin blends catchy song writing, beautiful harmony and lyrics that stand up to repeated listening.

Their work had been continually getting better with each release up until their last album, \"New Surrender\" which seemed to be lacking.  \"Cities\" is their best album to date and is a masterpiece, so for any album they make in the future, it will be hard to come close to being that good.  Well, \"Dark Is The Way\" is not far off.  It is not as good as \"Cities\" but certainly holds its own and has some amazing tracks.  There are a couple of tracks I don't really like too much but I'd say that there isn't much filler here.  The lyrics are ok but not great and this is what sets it apart from \"Cities\", which was as close to flawless as an album can be.  If you are like me and felt that \"New Surrender\" was not their best offering, you will find \"Dark is the Way\" to be alot closer to \"Cities.\"My favorite tracks are Art of War and You Belong Here.

{"text": "It could be argued that Anberlin are the kings of the post-punk alternative rock genre, and \"Dark Is The Way, Light Is A Place\" is certainly a catchy result of that reign. However, in an absurdly impressive library, \"Dark Is The Way\" is somewhat of a mixed entry.\"New Surrender,\" Anberlin's previous offering, had the potential to become the savior of pop-rock radio with a fantastic selection of heavy, introspective anthems and softer, more accessible pop offerings. Despite this, fans felt alienated, especially following their gritty magnum opus \"Cities,\" in which lead singer Stephen Christian was willing to delve into the minds of drug addicts, murderers, thieves, the vengeful, and the suicidal. \"Dark is the Way\" attempts to be a return to form without plumbing those depths with such brutal imagery. Likewise, the musical aspect of the album is significantly less aggressive than that of earlier outings.That's not to say that Anberlin does not infuse a few fist-pumpers into the mix. \"We Owe This To Ourselves\" and \"To The Wolves\" both convey heavy lyrical material over stadium-sized guitar and bass riffs. \"Closer\" would feel right at home somewhere on \"Cities,\" and \"Depraved\" follows Anberlin's tradition of closing an album with an epic song fluctuating between light and heavy (unfortunately, this is Anberlin's weakest closing track to date). That said, nothing here on \"Dark Is The Way\" really ever reaches the intensity of virtually any number from \"Cities.\" Instead, the listener is hit with a musical style more reminiscent of U2's \"No Line on the Horizon.\" Fortunately for Anberlin, the album manages to get more right than wrong in imitating U2. Indeed, the Edge himself might enjoy Anberlin's newest, even if he would likely feel a bit plagiarized. \"Take Me (As You Found Me),\" \"Pray Tell,\" and \"Art of War\" apply this more relaxed sound to great effect without losing the Anberlin vibe. No track on the album falls flat enough to warrant a complaint, with the exception of \"Down,\" which attempts to showcase a more vulnerable Christian on the microphone. This approach backfires when some vocals slide ever-so-slightly off-key; this is really inexcusable for such a talented vocalist as Christian.The critical reviews rave of a more mature, darker Anberlin, but \"Dark Is The Way\" really feels like a radio-ready, reduced-calorie \"Cities\" with a few of its own tricks. However, the whole is just as focused as anything Anberlin has previously released, and the band's reluctance to reach the questionably dark overtones of \"Cities\" is somewhat relieving. On its own, \"Dark Is The Way\" stands on its own two feet quite well. The love and care put into the new sound is apparent, even if everything seems a little more layered and little less aggressive than past releases. Those disenfranchised by \"New Surrender\" may want to take a listen before committing to this one, even if it is one of the year's most focused alternative rock offerings. Anberlin's new sound promises much but delivers slightly below the height it so ambitiously aims. With time, however, it is likely the band will call this sound home and one day craft something truly classic.Ten-point Scale: 7.0 out of 10Genre: Alternative RockObjectionable Content: MinimalRecommended: Moderately\n", "val": 0.0001357619185000658}

Hatsune Miku's songs are completely computer created. That might not sound as impressive until you do a little research to discover how hard someone had to work to make the song listenable. It's very easy to mess up with Vocaloid by under fine-tuning the songs, as I'm discovering on youtube.This is just a really fun song to listen to. It's light, upbeat, & kind of funny to listen to if you know what Miku is actually saying. (I found a subbed version on youtube, if you're curious.) It took me a while to fully adapt to the whole computer singing thing, but once I did I found myself getting caught up in the song.You really can't fully appreciate how neat the entire Vocaloid phenomenon is until you see some of the footage from the concerts. In order to keep the idea of the computer created singing voice, they actually project her onto a stage using rear projection. It's pretty amazing to watch. There are other more traditionally animated videos out there but the stage performances are the way to inaugurate yourself to Hatusne Miku.I absolutely recommend this song.

Though she's never found the chart-topping success as a singer that she's scored as a writer (having penned \"Wrong Side of Memphis\" for Trisha Yearwood, \"Wild Angels\" for Martina McBride, \"You Can Feel Bad\" for Patty Loveless and \"Strawberry Wine\" for Deana Carter, among dozens of other hit singles and album tracks), critics and fans have treasured her original performances. Unfortunately, when her former label (Rising Tide) closed shop in 1998, her last album found critical accolades that went unmatched by sales, and she returned to writing (including songs for the theatrical production&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Good-Ol-Girls/dp/B003W5QJEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Good Ol' Girls</a>), live performance and background singing.Berg's latest set shows off her talent for writing deeply personal songs that touch intimate, individual memories in each listener. Her songwriting craft and soulful performances suggest a modern-day Carole King, but one flowering at a time when music discovery has become highly balkanized. The funnel of country radio has narrowed further in the last decade, and the channels of indie promotion have simultaneously multiplied and fragmented. Berg's songs have always been thoughtful, but her lyrics have become more allusive and her performances more subtle and introspective, necessitating longer exposure than a ten-second Pandora needle-drop or snippets woven into an NPR review. Whether her new album gets the hearing it deserves will depend in large part on word-of-mouth from her fans.Writing in mid-life, the youthful optimism and wistful nostalgia of her earlier songs have taken a backseat to more realistic endings. The album's title track is a somber elegy for her grandfather's farm, one in which the golden hues of yesterday share space with the overgrowth and rust of today. The Hollywood dreams of a small town girl in \"Silver and Glass\" reveal themselves as fading illusions as age presents its inevitable transformations in the mirror. Even Berg's beloved cherubs, which served as guardians in 1995's \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wild-Angels/dp/B00136Q5J0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wild Angels</a>\" (a chart-topper for Martina McBride), have matured into escorts for a bittersweet final journey in \"Racing the Angels.\" Only 2002's \"Oh Cumberland\" (originally recorded with Emmylou Harris for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Will-the-Circle-Be-Unbroken-Vol-3/dp/B00006I4YE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Vol. 3</a>, revels unabashedly in the warmth of memories.Berg contemplates the attraction of dangerous liaisons in \"You and Tequila\" (co-written with Deana Carter, and recently released as a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/single/dp/B004TBWWIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">single</a>&nbsp;by Kenny Chesney and Grace Potter), but when vulnerability turns into deceit, a serial cheater's dalliances catch up to him in the foreboding \"Ode to Billy Joe\" styled \"Your Husband's Cheating on Us.\" Berg's a deft author of characters, including a battered woman taking a stand and a mother coping with the inexplicable loss of a soldier son; but her best character is often herself. She closes with the ballad \"A Cold, Rainy Morning in London in June,\" evoking her longing for home and her comfort in having a home to long for.

{"text": "Prime Cuts: Clouds, Oh Cumberland, A Cold, Rainy Morning in London in JuneLike a moth to a flame, over the years many artists just flock to record Matraca Berg's compositions.  These singers do come from the whole spectrum of genres including Linda Ronstadt (\"Walk On\"), Reba McEntire (\"The Last One to Know\"), Kenny Chesney and Grace Potter (\"Me and Tequila\"), Sara Evans (\"Fool, I'm a Woman\"), Trisha Yearwood (\"Lying to the Moon\") and Gretchen Wilson (\"I Don't Feel Like Loving You Today\").  A listen to Berg's first record in 13 years \"The Dreaming Fields\" will reveal the reasons why Berg has been such a much demanded scribe.  Her songs unfold like juicy gossips from a women's magazine where she chronicles for us the stories of love, deceit, anguish, pain and the fear of getting old.  Most importantly, Berg does not just sing; she makes us feel the emotions that brim beneath the surfaces of each track.  Berg has a way of helping us feel that these are more than just songs.  Rather, they are life stories coming out of the pages of our lives--some of which are so nebulously painful yet so profoundly articulated that they soothe our pains.  Such is the beauty of this disc.  But Berg is more than just a stellar writer, when she steps up to the microphone she is equally mesmerizing.  Her plaintive tenor in her vocals emphatically draws us effortlessly into each syllable leaving a bittersweet aftertaste that becomes so alluring.The tracks that do excel are the ballads, especially the heartbreaking kind.  Thankfully, they exist here in spades.  Check out the lonesome folk ballad \"If I Had Wings,\" a forlorn tale about an abused wife who finally had the courage to fight back.  Despite the song's acoustic framed arrangement it can hardly masked the violent lyrics as Berg sings, \"Mama said call a preacher, I just called the law/We all knew sooner or later/It was gonna be me or him...\"  In similar lines is the sultry bluesy \"Your Husband's Cheating on Us\" that also tells of infidelity but this time told from the perspective of the other woman. Berg vocally struts with such attitude that she could easily rival Reba McEntire on how to be a feisty yet classy diva.  Calling to mind her classic ballad \"Lying to the Moon,\" the guitar and fiddled led \"Clouds\" has the same haunting and searing melancholy that just makes heartache feels so good.  \"South of Heaven\" again is another emotional heavyweight as this time Berg is joined by her \"Wine, Women and Song\" road buddies Gretchen Peters and Suzy Bogguss on this anti-war song.  What sets \"South of Heaven\" apart from the copious songs about war is that it is told through the eyes of a terrified mother who cries: \"God you gave your only son, you are not the only one...\"Berg has resurrected two of her self-penned songs first recorded by her clients before.  The first is the current single \"Oh Cumberland,\" a track that first appeared on Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken Vol. 3.\"  A song Berg wrote for a homesick friend who had just moved to LA, this is just therapeutic stuff for the hurting.  The other cover is \"You and Tequila\" - the current single of Kenny Chesney and Grace Potter--here finds Berg drawing comparisons between the addiction of love and whiskey.  Even darker moments come with \"Silver and Glass\" as Berg explores the inevitable fate of getting old.  Of note also is the ruminative \"A Cold, Rainy Morning in London in June\" a wistful piano piece where the protagonist finds herself comparing to a lonely looking postcard.  Despite the understated backings, the emotions here are stark, penetrating and they really go for the heart.Perhaps a major quibble about this disc is that it's far too ballad driven.  One certainly misses Berg in her more sassy moments a la on her debut RCA disc where she sings \"I Got It Bad\" and the \"The Things You Left Undone.\"  Also a few tracks become far too indulgent and wordy including the pretty average \"Racing the Angels.\"  Nevertheless, despite these challenges, \"The Dreaming Fields\" is still land worth visiting for its realistic presentation of love and its ensuing tragedies.\n", "val": 0.014318792149424553}

The Dreaming Fields is a nice return for her.  I've seen it categorized a few places as \"folk,\" but to my ears most of these songs still sound like country.  It is country in the vein of Rosanne Cash's music or the like, singer-songwriter stuff.  Listen to \"Clouds\" with its exquisite pedal steel work, and see if it sounds like country or folk to you.  I'm going with country.  One nod in the other direction, the wistful title tune, does have a traditional folk air to it.The song lyrics to all eleven of these songs are available on the artist's web site, along with songwriting credits.  I noticed that several of Matraca's peers have joined her in writing the new tunes, including Gretchen Peters, Deanna Carter and Suzy Bogguss.

Largely overlooked by the mainstream, the exceptional talent of Matraca Berg and the fact that her career, for whatever reasons, never really took off almost makes her a cult artist, maybe that will change with this release. Her latest album \"dreaming fields\" finds a good balance balance for her, combining the authentic country sound of her first album \"lying to the moon\" with some of the atmosphere and polish found on her second album \"Speed of Grace\".Matraca's songwriting and vocals are as good as ever- which is actually amazing considering all the time that has passed since those RCA records came out. Those early albums also had great sound quality as a result of excellent audio engineering and mastering, and they came out before excessive limiting and compression were the norm in cd mastering. Dreaming fields is a masterpiece album from Matraca.

The lines are now jumping out at me, like \"Mom said call the preacher, I just called the law\" and \"lazy river, not a lick of ambition, just goes to Kentucky and comes back home again\" from my very favorite song, \"Oh Cumberland\". Matraca has plenty of help from cowriters including novelist Jill McCorkle on the soon to be standard, \"Your Husband's Cheating On Us.\" But the imprint of these songs is all hers.Of the album's 11 songs, only \"Clouds\" is just ok. The other 10 are pretty wonderful, from \"You and Tequila\" (CMA song of the year nominee) to \"Dreaming Fields\" to \"Silver and Glass\" to an atypical choice of subject in \"A Cold Rainy Morning in London in June\" which Matraca still pulls off very effectively. I love the opening guitar tones which introduce \"If I Had Wings\" which let the listener know they are not in for easy breezy songs on this album.

{"text": "Loudon Wainwright III\"High Wide & Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project\"(Second Story, 2009)---------------------------------This 2-CD set is a bold, brilliant tribute to Charlie Poole, one of the early old-timey country music superstars of the Great Depression, with singer-satirist Loudon Wainwright III taking a surprising, refreshing foray into earnest, straightforward traditional folk music.Charlie Poole was a notorious ne'er-do-well, a hard-drinking musical prodigy from a small town in North Carolina who became a star in the 1920s.  Like many artists of the era, he was poorly paid for his work, and while his records sold well, he found it hard to make ends meet.  Poole was an accomplished musician, one of the best clawhammer banjo players of his time, and a sly, humorous singer.  Eventually, the hard-living performer drank himself to death in 1931, as the economy collapsed and record sales fell flat -- Wainwright explores this mixed legacy, both the glory and the pathos, crafting a remarkable portrait that pierces the veil of time to present Poole as a three-dimensional person -- playful, boisterous, flawed and charismatic.Wainwright bookends cover versions of old classics with new compositions that illuminate Poole's life.  The first is the title track, \"High Wide & Handsome,\" a masterpiece of bragadoccio that paints the singer as a lusty, vibrant scoundrel, a charming, charismatic  braggart and lover of the good life -- in short, a rock star. Other Wainwright originals include \"Way Up In New York City,\" which tells the tale of Poole going to the big city to record his first big hit, \"Don't Let Your Deal Go Down Blues,\" a single on Columbia that sold over a 100,000 copies  in 1925 -- Poole and his trio got paid seventy-five bucks, a pat on the back and a train ride home.  Nonetheless, he went on to be an immensely popular performer with the wide palette of a classic vaudeville entertainer.  Here, Wainwright moves deftly through Poole's repertoire of ribald comedy songs (such as \"Moving Day,\" \"If I Lose\" and \"I'm The Man Who Rode The Mule Around The World\") as well as sweet, lachrymose, shamelessly sentimental weepers such as \"The Letter That Never Came,\" \"Old And Only In The Way,\" \"Mother's Last Farewell Kiss,\" and the gorgeous \"My Mother And My Sweetheart.\"  In a similar vein are several religious songs that Poole is reported to have performed regularly, but not recorded, and these are performed by Wainwright and his crew with stunning sincerity and emotional depth.Joining LW3 are co-producer Dick Connette, Wainwright's wife, Suzzy Roche, their daughter Lucy, and Lucy's immensely talented aunts (aka the Roches) as well as Loudon's own sibling, Sloane Wainwright and others in their orbit.  Suzzy Roche delivers a grand slam on the weary waltz that opens Disc Two, \"Man In The Moon,\" in which the character of Poole's wife laments married life with a irredeemable rambling man -- for me, this is the song which cements the biographical-literary elements of this album, with its haunting melody and a beautiful performance by Roche.  And then there's Loudon: a wry, sarcastic performer, he taps directly into the humorous elements of Poole's work, and brings them into a modern framework... Leaving behind the raspy, antique sound of Poole's old recordings, Wainwright lets modern listeners tap directly into the humor of the songs, without hearing them as mere museum pieces.  He also shows a not-too-surprising ability to connect with the sentimentality of the old-style weepers, and the passionate, otherworldly yearnings of the gospel tunes.In short, this collection in a real knockout: look for Loudon up on the platform when they're announcing the Grammys this year.

{"text": "I saw Loudon several months ago live in concert in Asheville, NC where spoke about at length and sang a few songs from the upcoming Charlie Poole concept album. He spoke of Charlie's life and how the project came together. At the time I found it odd that Loudon would attempt such a project about a 1920's bluegrass musician. The songs made little impression on me at the time and I quickly forgot about it. But when I saw the announcement the other day in Rolling Stone of the release of this 2 CD set set, and the first rate album art, I immediately got a strong gut feeling that this was going to be something magical. That my friends was an understatement!! In a nutshell, this CD is pure genius! I can't express in words how much I like this CD! Brillantly conceived and executed right down to the choice of studio musicians, album art, and liner notes, Loudon really belts one out of the park! I just hope that enough people hear it and can appreciate the gargantuan effort to put this tremendous project together. (check out the documentary on the making of this CD on YouTube) I have been a huge fan of Loudon since Album I and throughout his history his releases have oftentimes been uneven. However, If you have ever seen him in concert you know that his performances are always first rate and his showmansip is second to none. With this CD however, Loudon has clearly outdone himself. Everything here is firing on all pistons. The band and guest musicians just add the right flavor on every track. No overproduction here. If you like old time bluegrass or gospel music, or are just a fan of Loudon's music, I think there is something here for everyone. This CD gets 5 solid stars! My favorite tracks are \"Didn't He Ramble\", \"Beautiful\" and the title track \"High Wide and Handsome\" which also has a beautiful reprise at the end. Also an old time gospel number, \"The Great Reaping Day\" which literally brought tears to my eyes. The paltry $15.

He is revered by many folk and rock stars,and one of them is Loudon Wainwright, III.  Charlie Poole's band \"The Ramblers', was \"a bluesy fiddle lead, backed up by long, flowing, melodic guitar runs and the finger-style banjo picking of Poole. Predictable as it may be, it was nonetheless outstanding. No string band in early country music equalled the Ramblers' controlled, clean, well-patterned sound.\" He played mostly cover songs, but he wrote many songs, words and music. Charlie Poole left a legacy that many remember, and Loudon Wainwright III has honored him by singing many of his songs.This CD 'High Wide and Handsome:The Charlie Poole Project', has 2 discs with 30 songs of magnificent proportion.  Many of the tunes are written by Charlie Poole, but Loudon has inserted several of his own songs. Wainwright's children, Rufus and Martha, join in on several tunes to make this a CD that you want to listen to over and over again.  Charlie Poole was from North Carolina, and he always wanted to leave this world 'High Wide and Handsome'. That is an old southern expression that you called someone of wealth and importance.Some of these tunes make no sense at all' I'm The Man Who Rode The Mule Around The World' is one that many have tried to understand and finally left alone.  'My Mother and My Sweetheart' is a tune that memorializes two women that are loved by a man, such sweet and lovely lyrics. 'Goodbye Booze' seems to be a favorite of all.  Charlie Poole was a boozer and after a thirteen week drunk he died at the age of 38. The sentimental 'Mother's Farewell Kiss' is one of those songs where you sing along. 'Where the Whippoorwill Is Whispering Goodnight' is one of the old time tunes that brings back the times of Charlie Poole.  'The Man In The Moon'-is sung by Martha Wainwright and is about anyman, but seems too fit Charlie Poole.  'Moving Day' a song of non-payment for a flat seems to be full of Poole's life. This tune was the first song of Poole's that Wainwright heard, and he felt an instant karma. 'Old and Only In The Way' is a popular title of songs and is a song of the times in the 20's and 30's. 'Sweet Sunny South' has the old time banjo sound of Poole, written about his hometown. 'Rowena' is a song of Loudon Wainwright's mother, and dedicated to her..  'Ramblin's Blues' gives Charlie Poole's band, 'The Ramblers' a first class ride. 'Charlie's Last Song'- a tribute to Charlie Poole. And, the CD finishes with a reprise of 'High, Wide and Handsome'-that's how I like livin' he said.This is CD that reveres the memory of Charlie Poole, his truth, honesty and humor are there for all to see.  Loudon Wainwright, III sings and plays his part. As the 'Rolling Stone' said, \"Loudon Wainwright III, sings clever harmonies to songs about marriage, booze and rabble-rousing. Dude seems to know this subject matter very well!\"Highly Recommended.  prisrob 08-19-09<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Strange-Weirdos-Music-from-and-Inspired-by-the-Film-Knocked-Up/dp/B000P6R82C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Strange Weirdos: Music from and Inspired by the Film Knocked Up</a><a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Recovery/dp/B001B0IPJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Recovery</a><a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/History/dp/B000002US4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">History</a>\n", "val": 0.014801242388784885}

{"text": "I never really liked Loudon Wainwright, never gave him a chance because he wrote Dead Skunk in the Middle of the Road.  That song was catchy and funny, but I wrote him off as a sort-of Roger Miller type.  Friends made CDs for me, but I hardly listened to any of them.  The screen now shows clock hands spinning around to denote the passing of time.  About a month ago I heard Wainwright on the radio, probably on Robbie Ossman's Sunday music show, Across the Great Divide, on KPFA in Berkeley.  I was instantly captivated. He played one very sad song about a young man waiting his whole life for a letter from his childhood sweetheart which never came. He also played The Man Who Rode A Mule Around The World, a weirdly funny song that has nothing at all to do with riding a mule around the world.  It contains the line (which I remembered my father used to sing in another song) \"I saw Peter, Paul and Moses playing ring around the roses snd I'll whup the man who says it isn't so.\"  Some songs are mournful, songs about deaths and mother and lost loves.  Some songs are very funny.The banjo was Poole's forte, and the player on this CD is amazing, moving from rag-timey to mournful to sprightly with ease. It brought back memories of Jim Kweskin and Maria and Jeff Muldaur of the old jug band as well as the Memphis Jug Band (Stealin').The whole Wainwright clan (and they are numerous and talented - McGarrigles and Roches, too) joins in on lots of songs.To steal a line from Seinfeld...\"You gotta hear the WAINWRIGHT!\" I'm making up for all the years I dissed him by listening to his songs almost non-stop for the past 2 weeks.

The sound quality and engineering are superb, the performers, if not well-known, are first rate.  There is also something satisfying in knowing that you are hearing Sibelius performed by a Finnish symphony.  If you like what you hear here also know that BIS is almost finished with a complete release of everything Sibelius ever wrote.  I believe these performances are culled from that endeavor.  But, unless you are a die-hard Sibelian, you won't need much more than this set for your collection except perhaps a disc of songs and a disc of piano pieces.

The releases linked to above only contain symphonies 1-7 and \"Tapiola\" -- total run time 4:47. This release has all that plus the Overture in E Major, Finlandia, the Lemminkainen Suite, Valse Triste, the Violin Concerto, En Saga, the Karelia Suite and Snfrid. Total run time 7:27. Both sets even include two versions of Symphony No. 5 -- the original 1915 version, and the suped-up final version from 1919.Make no mistake, however -- this isn't just about bargain prices for a ton of music. Finland's Lahti Symphony Orchestra may not be a household name internationally, but they are justifiably renowned for their Sibelius. These are masterful performances by Sibelius specialists under their long-time conductor Osmo Vanska (now at the Minnesota Orchestra), who transformed this relatively small Finnish orchestra into a real Sibelius powerhouse.Just a note on the business side of things -- I was happy to see that the fantastic BIS label released this MP3 set itself. A lot of its recordings lately have been packaged by content provider X5 of Sweden, and it's a good feeling to hope that BIS might be getting just a bit larger share of the sales of these recordings in its own release.The total download size is 683 MB.

A weird version of Karelia (the first and third movements from the familiar suite, but the middle movement including baritone song from the original incarnation of the Ballade) is appropriated from Volume 8. And for some reason, an early Overture in E major and the minor Snfrid (for narrator, chorus and orchestra) are thrown in at the expense of the masterpieces Pohjala's Daughter, Luonnotar and Night Ride and Sunrise. Nevertheless, aside from those last three works, Voces Intimae and the best of the incidental music, you'll get all of Sibelius's most important works in this collection.There are a couple other Bis CD compilations floating around. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Complete-Symphonies/dp/B00005Q450/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Complete Symphonies</a>&nbsp;set has 4 CDs and gives you the same Vnsk/Lahti performances of the canonical symphonies plus Tapiola and the 1915 version of the Fifth. And as if that weren't enough, there's also the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Essential-Sibelius/dp/B000K2UF1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Essential Sibelius</a>&nbsp;set, which includes the canonical symphonies, violin concerto, most of the important tone poems and a sampling of the stage, chamber, piano and vocal music.Now on to the music: With such a tremendous range of recorded Sibelius symphonies to choose from, there's a genuine risk of disappointment when contemplating yet another addition to this legacy. But dedicated Sibelians have been aware of the scuttlebutt emerging over the 1990s and early 2000s over a certain regional Finnish orchestra and its low-key conductor -- how there was something unexpected and special there, both with their technical chops and with their approach to the repertory. Now this inexpensive set gives everyone a chance to hear what all the fuss was about.Vnsk and the Lahti combine a technical precision and sensitivity for orchestral balance with a re-reading of the original scores that favors extreme tempo contrasts and more literal observation of the composer's dynamic and interpretive markings. You might think of Vnsk's approach as Colin Davis meets Pierre Boulez. No one does better than the Lahti with those Sibelius's trademark sustained chords during which various instrumental groups are faded up or down to mutate the loudness and color. And Vnsk excels at adapting the orchestral sound to the era of multi-track digital audio recording. Keep an ear out for the definition in the bass register as you work your way through the tracks, and I expect that you'll hear some new details in these hackneyed masterpieces.Several of these interpretive novelties stand out for me. The First Symphony does well for a \"first symphony\" but is still heavily indebted to the Russian symphonic tradition, particularly Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, which provides the formal model. After the famous timpani and clarinet introduction, the first movement continues as an allegro in 6/4 time, starting with the beautiful first theme with its ambiguous tonality, hovering between E minor (the ostensible home key) and G major. Sibelius uncharacteristically provided a metronome indication for the allegro (dotted half note equals 108). This is quite brisk actually, and few conductors match it. Vnsk goes faster than most, but by my watch even he only clocks in at 100 or so. To be sure, some details get lost at this tempo, such as the timpani triplets underlying the oboes/clarinets' answer to the flute melody in thirds at the start of the second theme group. When the violins pick up the theme pizzicato, Sibelius gives the same triplets to the low flutes. These are rarely heard, and at Vnsk's tempo they're again barely audible. This is too bad, both because Sibelius was always underbalancing material he scored for low flutes (like the second theme in the scherzo of the 6th) and because these triplets come back in the development, after rehearsal letter M (ca. 5:20 and 5:26 in this recording).As is well known, this second theme group reprises a passage from the solo clarinet introduction. Meanwhile the high strings and harp alternate between F# major and first inversion C# minor chords. Officially this is in C# minor, and you're hearing IV/i6 chords in alternation, but due to the accents, and perhaps 100 years of assimilation of 20th Century modalism, I hear this as I/iv6 chords in F# major (with the E natural being a flat 7). When the violins repeat the tune pizzicato, it's in E minor, again with a flat 7. When the oboe proceeds to the next theme in this group, the tonality finally settles on B minor, the dominant minor, a relation that again emphasizes a modal flat 7. When the bassoons bring back the main second theme in counterpoint, it's the basis for an orchestral pyramid that climaxes in B minor, leading into the development, which changes to B major before setting off on a tour of various other keys. The second half of the development is devoted to the famous passage featuring chromatic scales moving down in the woodwinds and up at double speed in the cellos and double basses. At the climatic point where the first theme is reprised, Vnsk resists the temptation succumbed to by others, of slowing the tempo down suddenly.For some reason, Finlandia comes next in the track order. This has never been my favorite Sibelius piece, but hey, are those actual trills in the bass in the long static passage at the start of the Allegro moderato? Indeed they are, and you'll hear them clearly here.Another reviewer wrote that the Second Symphony is a frequent entry point to the world of Sibelius, and this was true in my case as well. As a boy I'd heard Finlandia and Valse Triste, and could recognize the opening chords of the 2nd, but it wasn't until my teenage years, and discovering the second movement, that I started to fall in love. Speaking of those opening string chords, they're marked lour (portato) in the score, and in most performances they tend to blur together, but the Lahti strings separate the notes, playing them almost staccato. I'm not sure that I like it, since when the chords recur later in the movement, Sibelius makes a distinction between lour and dtach bowing. For example, when they're heard in the second theme group, and then at the end of the exposition (just before the oboe solo), they're lour as before, but later, after the clarinet solo over timpani, they're dtach (and more menacing). Vnsk gets back on track at the end of the movement: most conductors slow way down here, but Vnsk observes Sibelius POCO rallentando indication, giving it a more modest conclusion, a simple pause leading right into the second movement's lugubrious opening.Speaking of the second movement, after the first theme group's Poco Allegro climax and subsidence, the beautiful second theme enters in F# major in subdivided strings. The dynamic indication here is ppp, only a hair louder than the C in the bass that just faded into near-nothingness. Vnsk is the first conductor I've heard actually take this at the limit of audibility. It takes some getting used to, but it's presumably closer to what Sibelius wanted. The woodwind entrance in sixteenth notes is only supposed to be pp, but it sounds too jarringly loud here. Curiously, when the oboes and clarinets come in a few bars later, over the sixteenth notes in flutes and bassoons, they're marked forte, though the strings have only increased to mp at this point (the flutes and bassoons are ambiguously marked poco f). This seems rather incoherent to me (and most conductors apparently, but Vnsk at least has a go of it. After the brief development section, where a motive from the second theme group is sequenced over violin trills, comes the recapitulation. The lugubrious bassoon theme from before is now recalled in a call and response between the first trumpet and the first flute, the latter being at the bottom of its register. The balance is always troublesome in live performances (do any conductors ask for an alto flute here to boost the dynamic level?) and it's problematic in this recording too. Also, the trumpeter plays with a little vibrato while the flutist plays with very little, which is a curious reversal of common practice nowadays.Moving along, remember that Poco Allegro climax to the first theme group in the exposition? Well Sibelius marks the corresponding recapitulation passage Allegro, suggesting that it should be faster the second time around. Most conductors ignore this, but Vnsk takes the recap much faster than the exposition, adding to the more familiar dramatic difference (the half-step lick originally in the woodwinds being given over to loud trumpets). At the climax during the Largamente, it sounds like Vnsk has the tuba joining the half-step sixteenth note pickups given to the double basses and bassoons, a departure from his usual fidelity to Sibelius's markings (according to my copy of the score, at least). The recapitulation of the second theme group starts mf in bassoons, violas and cellos, and is in D minor instead of the earlier F# major. At the coda, we again hear Vnsk's \"return to the text\" approach: the final chord held over pizzicato strings is ff, with a diminuendo that applies to most of the brass instruments but NOT to the woodwinds parts or the instruments sustaining the low D. In other words, as the chord is sustained, its color changes as trumpets and trombones fade out and the balance becomes more bottom-heavy.To many of us, the quality of the Second declines after the slow movement. The third movement lacks the originality of Sibelius's other \"scherzo\" movements, the bridge to the fourth movement is obviously cribbed from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and the fourth movement's second theme, a precursor to Shostakovich's Leningrad symphony or Ravel's Bolero that consists of several progressively louder and busier statements of the same melody over a repeating one-bar ostinato, has inspired as much derision as admiration. I'll simply offer that Vnsk doesn't apologize for the fourth movement in this regard, keeping tempo on the slow side.The Four Legends from the Kalevala follow. Listen to the climax toward the end of Lemminkinen and the Maidens of Saari: the sensuous wave of sound from the horns in syncopation is balanced perfectly against the woodwind filigrees (recalling the main theme), the pedal in the bass, and the recalls of the second theme in the upper strings. The Swan of Tuonela is perhaps the most famous English Horn solo in the orchestral repertory. It's played beautifully and with admirable wind control, especially in the exposed upper register (which Sibelius twice supports with an oboe doubling). The score reveals the considerable lengths that Sibelius often takes to conceal the ostensible 9/4 meter, an effect coupled in performance by the tendency of conductors (and English Horn soloists) to introduce a bit of rubato. Even the ordinarily fastidious Vnsk shortens some of the phrases that end with long sustained notes. Less successful is Lemminkinen in Tuonela, which is already uncharacteristically monotonous (for Sibelius), and especially prone to dragging at Vnsk's characteristically slow pace. The finale, with its two piccolos, is brilliant and dramatic without being bombastic.In the Third Symphony's first movement, the main theme gets buried under the running sixteenth notes at the recapitulation, an uncharacteristic defect of orchestral balance. On the other hand, the timpani B-C alternation underlying the reprise of the second theme is very well defined. The second movement is the most troublesome in all Sibelius's symphonies: very repetitive, cast in a predictable ternary form. It's the sort of piece that works if the theme is exceptionally beautiful, but the melodies here are only pedestrian by Sibelius standards, and the underscoring lacks the constant variety and invention that we associate with the master. Vnsk doesn't apologize for this movement either, though, taking it (once again) at a relatively show pace. This places strain on the intonation and breath control of the horns and woodwinds, but the Lahti band is up to the challenge. The third movement poses different problems, set in an unusual two-part form. The first part is fragmentary but goes on too long to feel strictly introductory, and the second part is an orchestral \"pyramid\" akin to the ending of the Second Symphony where a single theme gets louder and more elaborately accompanied on repetition. It's an odd coupling, but Vnsk approaches the movement by analogy to Night Ride and Sunrise (composed two years later), with the ending resembling a glorious northern sunrise. Note that both the first and last movements end with fortissimo orchestral chords where the timpani alone fades out (while rolling) as the chord is held.The Fourth and Fifth Symphonies are the holy grail of Sibelius symphony recordings. No. 4, widely considered the composer's greatest achievement, is given an intense and lugubrious reading, with great attention to detail. Leave it to Sibelius to come up with a tempo indication like MOLTO moderato (by which he apparently means slower than plain-old \"moderato\"). Vnsk takes it at an average tempo as interpretations of this piece go, which is a bit of a surprise given his penchant to favor the slow side of things. Sibelius was at his fussiest here when it comes to composed changes in dynamic levels, and the score is full of layered dynamic markings, chords sustained for an extra eighth note in selected instruments, crescendos from ppp to pp and back, etc. The Fourth also represents a high point in the pleasure Sibelius evidently took in disguising the notated beat, especially in slow movements. Have a look at the score (available online for free) and see how the E-F# alternation at the beginning undergoes a composed ritardando from syncopated quarter notes to dotted quarter notes to half notes. Or look at the passage in the development section for unaccompanied violins that sounds like a succession of eighth notes, but which the score reveals to actually be syncopated: the \"eighth notes\" are all offset from the true beat by a sixteenth note, leading the musicians to apply a degree of tension that Sibelius figures would otherwise be lacking.Vnsk's approach to all this, coupled with Bis's notoriously wide recording range, leads to some unusual results. For example, the slow buildup of the initial solo cello theme is handled conventionally up until the violin entrance, but then there's a sudden diminuendo that seems in excess of the simple single-level wedge marked in the score. Next comes a big crescendo (more justified, perhaps, since the score does has the ensemble going from about a pp to a ff in two bars' time) that leads to the brass entrance. On the first of their half-diminished 7th chords, the brass are all marked fp followed by a crescendo, but the timpani roll starts p without the loud attack. Vnsk uncharacteristically disregards this subtlety, allowing the timpanist to play with an accented attack like the brass.The slow movement taxes the intonation and breath control of any wind section, but again the Lahti team meets the challenge. Only the first oboe seems overbalanced during the solos, this being more of a mixing issue rather than a performance issue. The climax of the movement, where the strings break out with the main theme, the only time it's heard with its full shape, is handled as well here as anywhere. Vnsk notes the melodic anticipation of the forth movement after this climax, and proceeds immediately with the finale after the briefest of pauses. An ongoing controversy among conductors concerns what instrument to assign to the \"glocken\" part. Some opt for chimes, some, like Vnsk use a glockenspiel, and a handful use both. The second theme group features dissonant, acrid string chords, and there's not a lot of separation between them in this recording (and I think the texture gets a bit muddy as a result). The movement is an arch form where the ensuing passage with rapid C major scales comes in the middle, so this second theme group returns immediately, now accompanied by pizzicato strings instead of the dtach chords. There's a hint of playfulness or whimsy in the interpretation here. The climax at the return of the main theme again features less separation in the brass solos (ascending octaves in first horn and first trombone) than in most interpretations. Vnsk tends to avoid separating longer note values except when Sibelius explicitly requests it, and these octave leaps, like the aforementioned string chords, are half notes.The ending of the Fourth befuddles many conductors. There's no ritardando in the score, and the A minor string chords that close the work are marked dolce (how \"sweetly\" can you play A minor?) and mf. The odd choice of dynamic level (presumably the first time anyone ended a Romantic symphony mezzo-forte) makes a bit more sense when you observe that Sibelius has dropped the strings down to pp just before. But many conductors miss this nuance, slow the tempo down, and deliver these chords very softly and tragically. Vnsk can't resist a very slight ritard on the last couple of chords, but otherwise sticks to the composer's directions.The violin concerto follows in its final version from 1905 (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Volume-8/dp/B00284G2Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Volume 8</a>&nbsp;of Sibelius Edition additionally offers the original 1903-04 version). The performance features Leonidas Kavakos (with Vnsk and the Lahtis), who is amply up to the task, though the interpretation is relatively straightforward compared to, say, Mutter with her non-vibrato opening solo. The orchestra recording stands out for its bass definition (e.g., kettledrums and low strings in the opening of the finale.Next up is the Fifth Symphony in the final version from 1919 that we all know and love. The key to the first movement is controlling the subtly changing colors of the many sustained chords and pedals. This performance handles those complexities quite acceptably. A highlight is the aforementioned bassoon solo midway. It's often overplayed, with too much vibrato, but it gets some welcome restraint here. My ears cannot tell if the beginning of the solo is doubled by a sotto voce clarinet as requested by Sibelius. This passage leads into another series of orchestrally layered sustained chords that introduce the reprise of the second theme group. This seems undernuanced in the violins, while the accents in the brass seem exaggerated to me, but reasonable people can differ on this. In the B major tutti climax that follows, Vnsk departs from literalism with an interesting trick: he has the trombones playing fp on the downbeat of the 12/8 bars, which allows the trumpets to \"emerge\" more clearly out of the mix with the main theme. This scales down the brilliance (and perhaps the bombast) dramatically. Compare with the Colin Davis BSO recording from the 1970s, a typical \"loud\" rendering of this passage.Perhaps the trickiest passage in the 1919 Fifth Symphony is the entrance of the main theme after the moto perpetuo that launches the last movement. It's hard to find the balance between plowing through as though nothing structurally significant has happened (and the score gives you little help here, with no breaks or tempo changes) and overemphasizing the horn entrance (thus creating too obvious an interruption of the music's flow and subtle overlapping phrases). Vnsk doesn't disappoint here. The horn theme in thirds anchored on B-flat is just right, and the balance with the accompanying soaring theme in high cellos and woodwinds is perfect. There's a bit of emphasis on the tympani taps here thrown in for good measure. Toward the end of this glorious section, the double basses get sixteenth note pickups that sound more distinct than usual in this recording (remember what I said about listening to the bass register?). Too bad the sixteenth notes in the flutes that ensue at the return of the moto perpetuo theme are as buried here as they usually are in performance.In the misteroso section in G-flat major, the subdivided muted violins practically disappear (there's that crazy Bis dynamic range again). After a while, the upper strings, still muted and now playing spiccato, outline the famous horn tune, while two flutes and a clarinet recount the melody previously given to the high cellos and woodwinds. This tune has a distant, plaintive quality in this recording, and it sounds like the flutes are playing non vibrato. Next the spiccatos and mutes go away and the upper strings take the \"cello\" theme while the oboes get the \"horn\" theme anchored on B-flat. The key shifts back to the tonic of E-flat and the trumpets make their first entrance (aside from a single soft supporting chord), picking up the horn theme, but with a subtle change in harmony: whereas the horns were in strict parallel thirds throughout, the second trumpet goes up to A-flat instead of G every third and fourth measures. A detail that's often missed here is that the oboes double the trumpets on the second beat of each 3/2 measure. In real time, this long, drawn out coda comprises about half the length of the movement, leading to the famous ending with a hackneyed I6 - V - IV/V - V - I chord progression given in six sharp chords, with several beats of silence between them. Vnsk, like most conductors, cheats a bit here by shorting the rests by about a beat. The timpani pickups to the first, fifth and sixth chords are clearly separated here (note that it's a double grace note preceding the first chord, but a single pickup preceding the last two). There are many wonderful recorded Fifths, and this one doesn't astonish me, but I doubt you'll find it disappointing.En Saga comes next. An interesting detail here is where the dotted ||:tut te tut tut:|| rhythm of the second theme is clearly audible in the pizzicato lower strings in anticipation of the bass drum entrance.Symphony No. 6 is the most introverted of the symphonies except for No. 4. It's also a sentimental favorite among musicians, despite its unevenness. I dislike the schmaltzy opening in the upper strings (the double basses in fact don't play until the middle of the development section), but once past that I love the introspection and formal unpredictability of the first movement. Vnsk takes the second movement at a pretty slow pace -- it's marked Allegretto moderato but conductors nowadays seem to want to make it into a \"true\" slow movement to exaggerate the contrast with the Poco vivace that follows it. Unfortunately this is one case where slowing things down come at a price in rhythmic subtlety. The opening chorale passage in flutes and bassoons is in 3/4 like the rest of the movement, but although your ear will probably tell you that they're dotted quarter notes coming on every downbeat, they're actually two dotted quarter notes tied across the bar with the attack coming on the \"and\" of 2 (in the middle of the bar). It's not until a couple measures into the subsequent violin melody that you can finally nail where the true downbeat is. But if the tempo is too slow, and you lose the beat entirely, you're deprived of this \"aha\" moment.The first few minutes of this second movement are built on an alternation between the elaborate first theme group and a second theme that starts with an ascending melodic minor scale. This reaches a climax in one of Sibelius's most astonishing orchestral passages where some crazy scales in the strings, mostly eighth note triplets (in parallel thirds) with shorter notes often coming on the third beat, are combined with the first theme in the brass. Sibelius's idea here seems to be to create a wall of sound with forward motion and subtle rhythmic and textural changes, but the advantage of Vnsk's tempo is that you can hear every note in the runs. I'm not sure that's what the composer had in mind, but if you've heard this piece many times before, this is the sort of thing that can be revelatory.Just what key is the scherzo in? It starts in F major/D minor with no key signature, and for the first several bars, Sibelius avoids writing either a B or a B-flat. Soon we get both B-naturals and B-flats in close alternation, creating hints of Dorian or Lydian modalities. At the same time, the striking dotted note rhythms of the opening give way to steady eighth notes in 6/8 time, which leads to fast scales in strings and woodwinds, after which the first theme group settles on A minor where the main tune is given by flutes in thirds followed by oboes in thirds. The dotted notes return, this time in A minor but modulating to D minor for the second theme group, where the strings and reed instruments continue the hocketing with the kettledrums occasionally joining in. Somehow a melody in two flutes echoed by harp harmonics is supposed to penetrate through this -- in performance it's very hard to pull off, but the Lahtis, like everyone else who has recorded this piece, benefit from the wonders of multi-track recording here. The second theme group builds up the theme in a long stretto, followed by some brass snarls under which the string runs return to start the recapitulation (there's no development to speak of). As expected, the first theme group returns at the original pitch level, but the series of runs that leads into the main theme is extended by a few bars so that we wind up in D minor for the theme in parallel thirds (again in flutes followed by oboes). The second theme group, though is in A minor this time around. The brass snarls return with the string runs, and brief coda based on material from the first theme group closes the movement in D minor.Of the fourth movement I'll just say that it's not as overwrought as it frequently is, and the morendo at the end is breathtaking despite proceeding at full speed (Vnsk refuses the commonly indulged temptation to take an unmarked ritard).The Karelia music comes next. The Lahti French horns are solid in the first movement (oddly titled Intermezzo), and Vnsk picks ups the tempo slightly in the middle section before slackening it again at the reprise of the opening, probably an accurate interpretation of Sibelius's ambiguous tempo indications (e.g., Pi Moderato). As noted above, Bis' substitutes the usual Ballade with the version from the 1893 original, when Sibelius contributed \"Scenic Music for a Festival and Lottery in Aid of Education in the Province of Viipuri\". The key difference at the end, where the familiar English horn solo turns out to have been a Finnish song for baritone voice doubled by French horn that goes on for a few strophes rather than the single pass it gets in the Suite. The Alla Marcia finale sounds much the same as always.The opening of the Seventh Symphony is another of those Sibelius \"northern sunrise\" affairs. The very start is troublesome since it's nothing more than a couple of timpani strokes followed by a simple ascending minor scale. Vnsk begins very softly and crescendos on the scale so that it really does sound emergent. He takes the entire Seventh at about 23 minutes, toward the long end of the scale, but the piece doesn't seem to drag. One reason is the restraint exercised in the slow first section. Whereas many conductors get a bit overwrought on the louder passages there, exaggerating the louds and maximizing bowed string vibrato, Vnsk dials it down a notch, waiting until the famous trombone entrance before letting the orchestra loose. This takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to performances that lay everything out in the first seven minutes with maximum angst. But it has the advantage of moving the music along better, highlighting the recurrence of this material in the middle and ending, and shifting the work's proportions more toward the faster middle sections.Again, Vnsk handles the work's ending in a way that more closely follows Sibelius's markings than most recordings. The string sextuplets under the final occurrence of the trombone theme are audible as they work their way in \"fauxbourdon\" from the bass up to the treble. At the very end, the trumpets, trombones and most of the bass instruments are actually marked mf -- it's only the upper strings (on their B-C resolution) and woodwinds that rise to ff while the rest of the instruments are brought under. Most conductors go for the grand ending here, letting the entire orchestra blast away at ff and putting a fermata on the final consonance. But the two alternate (preliminary) versions of the ending that appear on CD 5 shed some light on thought process behind Sibelius's surprisingly modest conclusion, which Vnsk honors by observing his dynamic markings and proceeding in strict time. This is one of those revelatory moments that we've come to associate with Vnsk and Sibelius.After the minor curiosity Snfrid, we get another pass through the Fifth Symphony, but this time in its 1915 version, the earliest surviving incarnation of the work, and the one that was premiered before Sibelius's extensive reworkings during World War I. This version lay buried and inaccessible for decades before the Sibelius estate authorized a\n", "val": 5.555131065193564e-05}

{"text": "This industry of Finnish conductors around Sibelius reminds me of the Polish Chopin specialists of earlier decades - Malcuzynski, Brailowski, Askenase, Harasiewicz (plus Rubinstein, but he was a universal musician), with their claims to a \"special insight\" which wore increasingly thin as other master pianists showed the world how much more there was to discover in Chopin's works by a master reared on the widest possible tradition and culture. The Sibelius \"special insight\" musicians have been long in coming, but here they are in force, with their claims in one complete recording after another. To a critical ear, those claims might also sound a bit tinny after exposure to Barbirolli, Karajan and the odd single readings such as Bernstein's or Szell's No. 2. Being a specialist has never, in any humanities business, meant an automatic qualification to broad culture, deep music making or even a notably exceptional feeling for one's specialty.I'm going to ignore the verbal fanfare around Vanska, which is placing the music on a lower rung that its performance. What I expect is that he has something profound to say about the music through his performances. If not, then it simply boils down again to personal preference. In passing, I mention as a relevant criterion that I'm not a Sibelius specialist, neither are most other reviewers. But I have an affinity with his music, though not all of it, and this may well apply to many thousands of listeners too.I note therefore, a general preference of this conductor for clean, almost clinical textures. He has no tendency (a la young Bernstein) for letting himself go, for ebullience or exhilaration in e.g. the Finale of No. 2. Nor does he caress the delicate, silvery threads in No. 6 with especially subtle care. At the beginning of No. 4 I cannot discern any deep affinity for the mysterious unfurling of colours from the sombre, moody lower strings into the hesitant groping for light from violas and violins, miraculously accomplished by Barbirolli; nor in Tapiola the striking hollowness of the wind instruments as they buffet their echoing reeds and tubes against and across and over each other, which his Finnish rival Segerstam did outstandingly well.The deeply prayerful ruminations of long stretches of No. 7 are \"managed\" without any particularly sensitive attunement to their alternation between rough chordal and plaintively subdued flow down to the brass saturated climax. I cannot see Vanska handling the awkward two-note iterations in the middle of the head movement of No 5 more convincingly than e.g. Davis, who was non-plussed by them. Etcetera, etcetera.You should not, perhaps, take these comments as negatives. They are observations on specific episodes with draw my attention as moments of opportunity for exhibiting insight, or for drawing out the emotional specificity, or for handling the Sibelian instinct for unique colouring. Any conductor of any nationality may have a gift for them - and conversely! Vanska get many things \"right\" in this respect (in my sights), and is just as capable as any conductor for gliding over or not even noticing them. The overriding point seems to be, however, that a conductor should bring strong ideas to performances, whether Sibelius or any other. I do not get the impression that Vanska is temperamentally outstanding in this respect. He is thoroughly professional musician, takes this ethos seriously and makes music from a sense of conviction which is his own. But if, in the winged phrase, \"style is the man himself\", then I cannot detect the man in his conducting; it sounds much like the man in Oramo, Sakari, Jrvi, Blomstedt, Davis, Jansons et al. They all have their professional ethos and commitment with nuances that belong to themselves. But for \"big ideas\", for turning over the soil of the Sibelian landscape in order to go to the roots from where his musical sap rises up, I find myself still having to turn to the likes of Barbirolli, Szell, Beecham, Koussevitzky, the young Bernstein and Karajan. There is more style and individuality in this group than among their modern counterparts.So: Vanska's cycle is a respectable, well-conceived, well-played, consistently well managed and well recorded effort. But as for great ideas, deep immersion, profound understanding and utter conviction of communication and an enthusiasm that grabs hold of your soul - for those qualities you have to look elsewhere.\n", "val": 0.00011328587424941361}

{"text": "When I first began listening to classical music as a teenager, I was virtually penniless, so a bargain box was always exceptionally welcome.  Of course, sometimes suspiciously cheap classical sets are, indeed, too good to be true, full of unlistenable historic recordings that haven't been remastered, or played by performers who aren't quite up the music's challenges.  However, more often than not, you can find a real treasure.  I remember picking up some excellent sets like Ziman's Beethoven cycle on Arte Nova and Tinter's Bruckner on Naxos, both of which I still play often, even though I no longer have to bargain hunt quite so assiduously.  This Sibelius set is not only in the same category as the others I've mentioned -- it pretty easily surpasses them.While Sibelius has been served well on record, with no shortage of interesting and recommendable complete sets of the symphonies, this set stands out for its idiomatic bona fides (recorded by a Scandinavian label with a Finnish orchestra and conductor) and its completeness -- it even comes with the withdrawn original version of the Fifth Symphony, a fascinating comparison and a genuine rarity.  The recorded sound has excellent presence and an ever-so-slightly dry ambiance that very well serves Sibelius's music, which comes across best (in my opinion) when it does not sound too lush.Indeed, Osmo V&auml;nsk&auml; and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra here give very clear-eyed, unsentimental readings of the seven symphonies, plus almost all of the other orchestral works you'll need.  I almost caught myself calling them \"fill-ups,\" but in the case of this set, they aren't -- this is more like a set of \"essential orchestral music\" rather than symphonies + filler.  In fact, the only essential works not here are pretty much Kullervo, Lunnotar, Pohjola's Daughter, maybe Pelleas and Melisande and Night Ride and Sunrise ...In the wrong hands, Sibelius can come across sounding rather too Romantic and conservative; I have to imagine it was more this kind of performance than the music itself that led Ren&eacute; Leibowitz to notoriously proclaim him the \"worst composer alive.\"  In fact, his music is tremendously sophisticated and original, and while it is certainly not modernist, it is by no means conventional.  V&auml;nsk&auml; consistently refuses to sentimentalize this music in any way, avoiding excessive rubato and (with a few notable exceptions) moving tempi right along.  Again, coupled with BIS's excellent acoustic, this makes for an extremely clear presentation of the music with all its clarity of line and bleakly moving orchestration fully intact (give The Swan of Tuonela a listen -- rarely has this famous music come across with more chilling beauty and less schlock).  The Lahti Symphony is equally superb, and I want to hear more from both orchestra and conductor (evidently they have recorded a Beethoven cycle together).Even if it were less accomplished, this set would still be worth owning at the price.  However, as I work my way through it, I find questionable interpretations to be few and far between.  I think I will always prefer recordings of the First Symphony that allow the music to breathe a bit more (especially the first movement, which is at breakneck speed here).  V&auml;nsk&auml; sounds just a bit perfunctory in the Alla Marcia of the Karelia Suite (admittedly, not the greatest thing the composer ever wrote), and Ormandy's old recording catches more of the pungency in En Saga's opening dissonances.  Still, these quibbles are so small, and so much matters of individual taste, as to be immaterial.  These fresh, idiomatic, exciting performances would be a bargain at five times the price, and this set is by far and away the best introduction to the composer.\n", "val": 0.009321379475295544}
{"text": "I know this album (or whatever you call a download featuring all 7 symphonies plus assorted works!) needs no recommendation: it's $7.99 for an incredible amount of music, enough to fit on several standard discs.  However, since some may be skeptical about its artistic worth, I thought I would weigh in since I not only adore these performances but they are, without a doubt, some of the best available.  For starters, all of these symphonies were originally recorded and released separately on the BIS label, which is famous for stellar artists and recordings (indeed, you can download the same performances of the symphonies alone for $18!).  As teasers to get people interested in the works or the label, BIS has done the same thing for Otaka's survey of Glazunov's symphonies with his Welsh Orchestra (another major steal--that one goes for only $6.99), and Jarvi's survey of Tchaikovsky's symphonies and orchestral works.  So have no hesitation about buying this even if you have other versions of the symphonies or even complete cycles.  These aren't cheap, one-off performances by some hired temp orchestra that you find on anonymous budget labels--this is truly the real thing.  Check the Penguin Guide for Classical Music or Grammophone or the American Record Guide: all of these works have been reviewed, and largely praised by classical music critics.The Lahti Symphony Orchestra is a Finnish orchestra, so right off the bat you get something you won't find in your standard London Symphony or NY Philharmonic recordings: this is their music.  And while I'm sure many Finns are sick to death of hearing about Sibelius, the orchestras certainly have it in their blood.  I prefer renditions by Finnish and/or Scandinavian orchestras, since they bring out a certain temperament and feel that other orchestras sometimes lack.  Osmo Vanska is a first-rate conductor who has recorded the complete works of Sibelius, a Beethoven cycle, etc., and besides being prolific, offers compelling, thoughtful interpretations of even Sibelius' most overplayed works.  The sound quality, with one or two exceptions, is also astounding.  These versions of Sibelius' most popular orchestral scores rank up with comparable versions by Berglund, Karajan, Bernstein, Davis, Sakari, and many others, though I return to Vanska more frequently thanks to this timely and budget-conscious set.Here are a few highlights (to me) of the set and strong reasons for buying it:1. Besides the 7 symphonies, you get a strong, moody performance of the Violin Concerto, two tone poems (En Saga and Tapiola), the obligatory Finlandia, Valse Triste, and Karelia Suite, Snowfrid, a totally unknown (to most listeners) piece for orchestra, chorus, and reciter (only in one brief passage), the magical Lemminkainen Suite, and best of all, the super early Overture which was Sibelius' very first orchestral work.  Granted, it would have been nice to have Pohjola's Daughter, the Oceanides, The Bard, and/or Lunnotar in place of a few of the works, but it's already an embarrassment of riches!2. You get a phenomenal performance of symphonies 3, 4, 5, and 6, which I consider some of the best on the market.  No. 3 is slower than usual, which really brings out the timeless poetry of the slow movement.  One reviewer once criticized Maazel's version which took it so fast that it sounded like \"50's doo-wop.\"  Vanska takes 11 minutes!  Compare that to the more average 8 minutes (though I've heard one at 7:30!).  It changes the way you perceive the entire score.  No. 4 is haunting, yet charming at times, especially in the second movement--a lot like Karajan's.  No. 5 is majestic and powerful, while No. 6 makes that work, often dismissed as a light, chamber \"tone poem\" as something imposing, dark and symphonic.  I adore No. 6, but I've never heard it quite like this.  It's an impressive interpretation.  The other symphonies are fantastic as well, though these, to me, are the highlights.3. Vanska's version of Tapiola is hair-raising--the best I've ever heard.  Simply amazing.  I've heard every version of this piece, I think, and used to prefer Segerstam's brooding account with the Danish Symphony.  This is similar but has more momentum and raw power.  It's almost worth the entire price to hear this piece alone.  The performance of the early Overture is also stunning and I think an improvement over Jarvi's recording for BIS.  It's a great little work!  Too bad they didn't include the \"Ballet Scene\" that was written to accompany it.4. The Violin Concerto is much different than your typical run-of-the-mill virtuoso recording: instead of playing up the violin pyrotechnics, Vanska takes a more symphonic, 'earthy' approach, if you will.  The violinist is amazing, yet he, too, isn't going for applause alone.  Very brooding and dark, just the way I prefer my Sibelius.5. With the oft-recorded Karelia Suite, you get an extended version (the original) of the slow movement, with a baritone toward the middle singing the familiar melody.  This is unexpected and quite nice.  The movement is also longer to boot, which doesn't hurt.  The entire suite is played beautifully.6. The Lemminkainen Suite is another subtle, almost 'shamanic' performance--going more for atmosphere than virtuosity.  The sound is a bit low in this piece, so at times it fades away entirely...then roars back to life.  I prefer Sakari's version with the Iceland Symphony on the whole, though I'm warming to this version more and more.7. You also get the 1915 version (the original) of the 5th symphony, which is in 4 movements(!).  At times it has much of the same material, but it's not presented in the familiar fashion and is very confusing--but interesting.  No, it's not a better piece, but it's a rare chance to hear what the world first heard at the symphony's premier.  I wish they had included the original version of the Violin Concerto as well, which originally accompanied this performance of the concerto on BIS.  Ah well.Buy this while it's still available and glory in the sheer beauty of the music and its heavenly lengths!  Also buy the Glazunov set (by Otaka) which is beautifully played and offers some of the best forgotten masterpieces of 19th century symphonic music.  Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.04027256742119789}
{"text": "I agree totally with other reviewers that this is a great record of excellent performances, perhaps equal to the best available, and in very good sound. It would be my preferred set of the Sibelius symphonies along with all the other goodies, BUT...And it may be a big \"but.\" The dynamic range of these recordings is excessively wide. It is VERY difficult to listen to these performances in other than the best and quietest environment. Otherwise, you will be turning the volume up and down constantly to hear the soft passages and avoid eviction notices in the loud ones. I have no other recordings that have such an unusually wide dynamic range, or where it is so troubling.Well, for the very modest price it may be worth finding out if this is a problem for you. For myself, I really REALLY wish that the engineers had been a bit more conservative!\n", "val": 0.012514468282461166}
{"text": "First of all, I agree that the performances on this set are all excellent and that, for $7.99, it's a great bargain. Unfortunately, quite often, the labels and Amazon often do not identify when recordings were made, which makes it difficult to know what you're getting. On the surface, this and other budget-priced collections, look like great bargains, which, in this case, it apparently is. However, I have found that many budget-priced albums are what are kindly referred to as \"historic\" recordings, which might be great in terms of artistry but sorely lacking when it comes to fidelity and sound quality.A case in point, actually two cases: I recently found two budget-priced collections, both feature Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The first is an exceptional 6-CD collection of English music, containing over 80 selections that Amazon is selling for only $16.66. It mostly contains what many would regard as definitive interpretations of pieces by Frederick Delius, a composer that Sir Thomas greatly admired and championed. Some of the recordings have dates, which tell us when they were digitally re-mastered. They also have something of a pedigree by the fact that the album is being re-issued on EMI, the original or one of the original parent labels, which is well known for producing quality products. This album can be found here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sir-Thomas-Beecham-The-English-Collection/dp/B004PXAWRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sir Thomas Beecham: The English Collection</a>The second collection is a proverbial \"pig-in-a-poke\". It is also conducted by Beecham and is called \"The Very Best of Frederick Delius\"' On the whole, it is a quasi-representative sampling of the composer's work. However, a comparison of the timings of some of the works suggests they are different recordings. The label, \"Discover Classical Music\", which, compared to EMI, lacks credibility. It's quite possible that these are not studio recordings but transcriptions of BBC radio broadcasts. Recording is here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Very-Best-of-Frederick-Delius/dp/B0036B7M4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Very Best of Frederick Delius</a>Getting back to the Vanska Sibelius set: I also compared the timings of some of the pieces on the budget-priced set with those on the more expensive collection and they were identical, which suggests that these two issues are the same.Bottom-line: Amazon should insist that their suppliers provide information re when and how the recordings were recorded (studio or live) and originally issued.\n", "val": 0.00015922845341265202}
{"text": "Don't let the $5.99 price tag fool you.  This is a great set of Sibelius.  Even if you already own a lot of Sibelius (like I do) you will enjoy this compilation.In particular, I have found the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th symphonies in this collection to be the equal of the best recordings I have heard.  In particular, the sound engineering is wonderful.  I heard a lot of details in this recording that I had somehow missed in others.  In these recordings you will find great musicianship combined with energy, passion, and precision.I think the only disappointment in the set for me was the Lemminkinen suite.  Compared to Ormandy/Philadelphia, this conception is too restrained and tame. But no set as large as this could feature the best recordings of every single piece.Before purchasing this set, I had not heard the Overture in E major -- now it is one of my favorite Sibelius pieces.  And the recording of the 1st version of the 5th symphony is a wonder.  I think I actually like this as much as the familiar, final version.  It certainly allows a fresh perspective on this greatest of the Sibelius symphonies.If you are not familiar with Sibelius, this is a great place to start.  If you are an aficionado, this is a must-have addition to your collection.  Many hours of great listening await you.\n", "val": 0.09140665829181671}

A lot has been said already and most I agree with so no need for a long review. I will say that \"You Can't See Me\", \"New Day\", \"Put It Back Together Again\" and \"When Two Become One\" are all single material!! Radio needs songs like these!!I felt the same way about \"Holdin' On\" and \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" off of So Damn Happy. This CD as a whole is a great CD and like Aretha said \"there is something for everybody on A Woman.\"I am a little baffled by the title though. When listening to \"When Two Become One\" Ree sounds a million miles away from falling out of love. I personal think \"New Day\" would have been a perfect title in light of Ree coming back after some health issues in 2010. Also a new photo shoot should have been done so Ree could show off the weight lose.I would like to say it is nice to see the Queen still packing them in at her recent concerts. 18,000 people to be exact showed up and was thrilled by her in Toronto on 6-24-2011.

{"text": "It's hard to imagine that a legacy artist such as Aretha would even be bothered putting out a new album at this point in her life. Honestly she doesn't have to. Even the decade before the new millenium rang in she was long overdue for retirement in terms of accomplishment. For the most part,her 80's comeback could easily have been it. But she kept doing it,again and again and disappearing for longer times in between. Somewhere after&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rose-Is-Still-a-Rose/dp/B000002VTV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rose Is Still a Rose</a>&nbsp;I personally stopped paying attention. Well a few things have happened. For one people such as Beyonce,with songs such as \"Single Ladies\" have been strongly extending on Aretha's classic Atlantic era song's messages regarding black female pride and confidence for the newer generation of soul music lovers. Not only that but Ree herself has apparently returned from a long illness,somewhat wiser for the where and actually in a very good position...well to make what might well amount to be one of her final albums,if not THE final one.  Either way there's much interesting to be found on this album. Released and produced independantly on her own label and with very limited distrobution this has Aretha staying true to her unique style of making music as opposed to necesserily trying to appeal to current pop markets. What this album has is A LOT of soul. And that meaning something of a return to the flavors of her Atlantic recordings only minus just a little bit of the funk and plus a lot more blues and jazz. While \"New Day\" is one song with a mildly current rhythmic flavor songs such as \"How Long I've Been Waiting\",\"Put It Back Together Again\" and interpretations of \"Faithful\",\"A Summer Place\" and \"The Way We Were\" all have her lushly arranged,orchestrated gospel styled soul fully intact. Something in the league of latter day Ray Charles;big melodies,lots of backround singers. Difference is:I could never say Aretha sounds like she just has \"character\" now. Her vocal instrument is still fully at the top of her game and on other songs such as witty \"This You Should Know\" and \"U Can't See Me\" find her bringing out her jazzier vocal side even greater than....you'd find on her early Columbia era albums.  She also finds room for some healthy musical curiousities as well with a stomping blues number on BB Kings \"Sweet Sixteen\" and the no frills gospel of \"His Eye Is On The Sparrow\" is a deeply moving piece sung very uniquely by her son Eddie rather than her-a man who not long ago also had a brush with death. This isn't an album about endings. It's about possible new beginnings. It's a very inspiring listen that will reach people of all ages and types who enjoy being moved by what they listen to as opposed to merely liking backround noise while they do other things. This is one of those modern records that kind of demands one listens through to it's moods,textures and the different fluxuations of emotion Aretha puts into every single note she sings. It's true as well: she did the exact same thing on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/I-Never-Loved-a-Man-the-Way-I-Love-You/dp/B0000033IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You</a>&nbsp;almost half a century ago,lucky to have that out during the time when that was what all music listeners expected. So it's all the more refreshing that even when the expectations for music are relatively low Aretha is still coming at her art with all the more soul,fire and ability that she always did. And even as she approaches her seventh decade of life that's a very good feeling. Not only for her but those many still wanting to hear what \"the queen\" is up to.\n", "val": 0.007664162199944258}

Aretha first talked about this album/CD back in March 30, 1994 on Video Soul a Two Hour Special with Donny Simpson taken at Ree's home at the piano.  Boy was this a treat and thank god I was able to copy the VHS Tape to a CD this was a Very Rare Special on Ms Ree. Aretha was very relax and open with Donny for the next Two Hours I was in heaven lord have mercy! It was here I first learned of her Pet CD she was puting together something Ree has always wanted to do for herself and for her fans. They were going to be songs she wanted to sing, arrange and produce all done by Aretha. To make a long story short alot of the songs she sang on this show later came to be a 13 year wait for me. At the time I did not know those gems would all be on a CD made by the late great Jerry Wexler compilated and put together alot unissed First Time on any CD.

I did not connect like I have with your other CD's. Ree, I luv the jazz vib on several songs you should hook up with David Sanborn let Herbie Hannock, Phil Ramon, John Burk and Noel Lee or Mr. Tommy LiPuma Co-Produce with you.

You need to record in High-Definition Digital Music Stereo Ree the sound mixer droped the ball here the quality was just not here and the problem with the song A Summer Place a beautiful song now with words. The track is totally messed up and the problems continue Your vocals are just not clear. I heard you but I don't feel ya and that's not the Ree I know. You have several hits on this New CD these tracks need to be corrected and off to the air waves and more TV appearances and a Music Video or two would be Great.

I went to Walmart looking for Yolanda Adam's new CD and surprisingly discovered Aretha's.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some Yolanda Adams but I must admit after purchasing both, I unwrapped the Queen's first and popped it in the player and boy was I delighted I did!  Now mind you, I just as many others, enjoy and miss the back-in-the day Aretha when she use to belt out all the hits that we all love and still do.  I would put on an Aretha Franklin greatest hits CD and clean my entire house from top to bottom - singing right along all the while.  It just made you feel good.  Let's be real.  You can expect that as we all grow older, things change.  You can't expect someone to sound like they did when they were younger.  I have purchased nearly all of her later work as well as the old and her voice has increasingly strengthened over the last decade.  I used to wonder whether she would always feel obligated to try and give us the same sound as back in the day by singing most of her songs in her falsetto upper range.  I don't know if she will ever read this but I want her to know that I simply LOVE when she sings in her full voice lower range.  OMG!  Nobody can do a vocal run like the Queen!  On this project I am very impressed and pleased that she chose to use her lower range more and she has mastered the art of transitioning between the two.  She seemlessly can go from a low jazzy run right on up into the rafters using her falsetto and then back down again if she wants to!Ok...as for the project...I love the entire project from beginning to end.  She included quite a few tracks that are reminiscent of the older hits where you primarily hear the piano which I love - and the background vocals are slamming!  We don't hear singing like this anymore which is sad.  You will not be disappointed with tracks like \"How Long I've Waited, \"New Day,\" \"Put it Back Together Again and \"When Two Become One.\"  My absolute favorite is \"U Can't See Me.\"  I don't know who is doing the marketing for this project but it will be a sin and a shame if we don't get to hear \"U Can't See Me\" all over the airwaves.  This is a HIT!!!  The Queen is doing her thang and it is jazzy, sassy and she never sounded so good on it.  The lyrics of this song begin with \"You want to holla at Ree...baby boy...there is no possibility..\"  WOW!!! I'm telling you this project is a winner and a MUST HAVE IN YOUR MUSICAL COLLECTION!

{"text": "Featuring an eclectic mix of  gospel, ballads, blues-infused and nods to urban hip-hop, \"A Woman Falling Out of Love\" is the  long awaited and over due return of Aretha Franklin. Anticipated since the spring of 2008, Franklin's new recording features two songs she wrote and  several she self produced, rather than the established hit makers assigned her during her tenure at Arista,  finally  released on her own label, Aretha's Records.The release of this recording was partially due to legal problems during her tenure at Arista Records, whose president, Clive Davis  at the time felt she owned the label one more recording. In the interveining years, Franklin faced life threatening surgery and Davis softened his stand. With Aretha regaining her health, she thrilled 18,000 fans who crammed  Metro Square  to hear her sing,  headlining the 25th anniversary of the  Toronto Jazz Festival,  June 24th, 2011.Aretha's self penned  ballads include How Long I've Waited and This You Should Know. Her long held fascination with pop standard material shines through with her unique takes of  A Summer Place and The Way We Were, a tour de force interpretation featuring a stunning duet with Ronald Isley. B.B. King's Sweet Sixteen harkens back to Aretha's best Atlantic blues recordings.  A nod to her gospel fans include Faithful featuring Karin Clark-Sheard, and His Eye Is On The Sparrow. Oddly, Sparrow does not feature Aretha on vocals, but rather, Eddie Franklin with Aretha providing  piano accompaniment.  Rounding out this set are two hip- hop urban flavored grooves U Can't See Me and When You Become One,  written by Curtis Boone, proving Aretha still has the vocal chops to get down and funk it up with a contemporary street vibe.  Perhaps the most poignant song on this new set is the autobiographical ballad, Put It Back Together Again, featuring the lyrics \"I  flip through the pages of  old photo book, I had to take a second look, at where we've been and were we come from.\" This reviewer couldn't help but reflect that this entire recording is in a way, a summary of all the wonderful musical places Aretha has taken her fans over the many decades of her musical career, and in a way, listening to this compact disc is like revisiting her greatest triumphs of the past, and reminding us that there is still a lot more she can surprise us with.The fact that this recording sat unreleased for over three years and still sounds fresh is a tribute to Aretha.  Few of  today's crop of diva's could  pull this off. Unfortunately an initial glitch with a skip during A Summer Place, this recording has been recalled, further adding to the wait fans must endure.  Well worth the effort to seek out at specific  outlet during the first month of distribution,  before becoming widely available in the near future, this is a most welcome return of The Queen Of Soul and whets the appetite for what is yet to come from the undisputed Queen of Soul.\n", "val": 0.029978912323713303}

It shines through on this album as well (although watching  someone play the hurdy gurdy and sing at the same time is mesmerizing and can't be matched by a CD).  Their musical interpretation of Lanlaire,(track 1), lyric by Gustave Nadeau is worth the price of the Cd alone..but then that could be said of almost every cut..Petite Reve, Mamzelle Kennedy, Rossignolet,and Ecris Moi stand out though..spellbinding and completely infecious..what joy!!!\n", "val": 0.039303239434957504}

{"text": "Warning: Track 5, Mamzelle Kennedy and Track 6, Les Mtiers, are pure joy. The other fine works on this latest album of the great instrumental and vocal folk group from Quebec, Canada, Le Vent du Nord, also contribute to a grand, mature musical collection. This is the group's most varied yet well-balanced album, with mainly tradition-based ballads and dances, heroic tales, nostalgic laments, and even an arrangement recalling the music hall or oldtime bandstand. The musicians perform with such energy and cheer that the listener cannot help but share in the fun. This is a very satisfying album. I must be a fan because it is my third from these Qubecois. The style of folk song typically involves a solo singer presenting a verse or phrase with immediate choral repetitions. Instruments, which include piano and diatonic accordions, hurdy gurdy, jaw harp, violin, guitar, mandolin, piano, and bouzouki and percussion, provide an ancient and traditional country sound to modern arrangements.\n", "val": 0.05359088256955147}

They change the lyrics around so if the song had bad lyrics before, they are definitely better when Karmin sings them. I think they said in a interview they change the lyrics of some songs because they know they have little kids who listen to their music.

{"text": "The rock band Parachute has had a great debut CD release in 2009 titled 'Losing Sleep'. Together with their sophomore CD release 'The Way It Was', the band has build up great expectation for their fans with the first single \"Something To Believe In\" & as well as the band playing some new songs before CD release including \"Break My Heart For Me\" & \"Square One\" which are surprisingly not in this new CD. 'The way It Was' CD has a great rock sound, beautiful clear vocals, great compositions & a wonderful production. This great CD (9 tracks) opens with \"White Dress\" : a great rock track with great vocals & melody. Other great tracks include \"You And Me\", \"Something To Believe In\" (a great first single/video) & \"American Secrets\" (strong beautiful drums, track has a great first part, getting better in the second part. The title of this CD is from the lyrics of this great longish track). Solid tracks/gems/stand-outs are \"Forever And Always\" (a beautiful ballad with inspirational lyrics, great vocals & melody), \"What I Know\" (a wonderful track with great guitar chords, melody & harmonies. This is my favourite track from this CD), \"Kiss Me Slowly\" (a slow-tempo track with beautiful guitar & melody. This song is composed by the popular multi-award winning country music band Lady Antebellum) & \"Philadelphia\" (another slow-tempo track with wonderful guitar & low-pitched vocals). There is no weak track in this CD. On overall, this is a great CD release by the talented rock band Parachute, they have certainly landed safely on firm ground, a highly recommended CD listening.\n", "val": 0.03642350435256958}

In fact, I think I like the sophomore album a little better.  Musically and lyrically speaking, the content seems more developed and mature.  If I had to pinpoint a target audience for Parachute, I would say musically 13+, lyrically 18+.  The beats are catchy, I can see 13-year-olds rocking out to it, but the depth of the lyrics can really be relatable to someone who is older.  For that, I am really grateful!For me, the standout tracks are...- White Dress:  super fun beat, you HAVE TO rock out to this.- Forever and Always:  just listen to the lyrics.  the song basically tells a story of a couple... such a beautiful beautiful story.  you WILL tear up listening to this.- Kiss Me Slowly:  I  believe they wrote this with Lady Antebellum.  just an awesome song, wonderfully composed.P.S.

I use to be huge Lady GaGa fan, but ever since The Way It Was came out I have been a huge fan of Parachute! That will never change because every single song that they have released I have and enjoy it. Call me crazy, but to be honest with you guys I listen to Parachute every single day.

In my opinion, \"The Way It Was\"(2011) and their first CD sound miles apart, in a good way. They kept their pop-rock soul feel, they sound like the same great band, but more mature. I feel like the songwriting was deeper and more inspired this time, with lyrics anyone can relate to in one way or another. The music (more or less in the words of lead singer Will Anderson) has no fillers, it's just killer. What I mean by that: there's a simplicity about the arrangements that make the tracks sound fuller (it's quite genius). \"The Way It Was\" has a little bit of everything; fun, upbeat songs that you can dance to (White Dress, Halfway, You and Me), and slow, smooth ones (Kiss Me Slowly, Philadelphia, Forever and Always), and well, everything in between.

{"text": "For me, the band Parachute was an unknown entity until I saw a reference online to their song 'Kiss Me Slowly'. After listening to (and falling in love with) it, I brought up other tracks before going out to purchase their sophomore album, \"The Way It Was\". Looking back, it was fortuitous that I happened to be on that particular website that day; I'm in love with the album.Having absolutely no clue about the band or their past before hearing this one, I have no idea how it compares to their previous record. However, this one is spectacular. Parachute manages to combine elements of Matchbox Twenty, Augustana, and The Script, along with their own blend of magic, weaving nine beautiful tracks. 'White Dress' has an unforgettable chorus and infectious energy. 'What I Know' is slightly more acoustic, though still brilliantly crafted, and 'Something to Believe In' almost channels Boston. Other favorite tracks include 'Kiss Me Slowly' (a bit slower and more like The Script than any other song on here) and 'Forever and Always', a heart-wrenching song about lifelong love.It's difficult to put this album into words because it is absolutely amazing. As I've listened to it, I've been wondering how this brilliant band managed to fly under my radar for as long as they have. The only complaint about this one is the fact that, at nine tracks, it's too short for me. I can't wait to not only look back at their debut effort but hear more from this talented group.\n", "val": 0.017557041719555855}

I've never experienced that from beginning to end with any other album.Musicwise, this album has a little bit of everything, from groovy, night-on-the-town jams like \"White Dress\" to the rebellious, adventurous, (awesomely) string-laden \"You and Me.\"  I also love the musical diversity throughout the album, from Kit French's killer sax breakdowns on \"Halfway\" to the inspirational touch that the choir brings in \"Something to Believe In.\"I would go through each song and describe them one by one but this review would probably turn into an endless gushfest, so I'll just leave it at this: \"The Way It Was\" is an absolute gem of an album and one of my favorites.

{"text": "West Cross Timbers thrust Amanda into the debate regarding the best American songwriters; Carrying Lightening forces her to the front of that conversation. If I have a complaint it's that this song collection is overproduced in places and distracts rather than enhances. She Let Go of Her Kite especially suffers on that point but When You Need a Train and Sloe Gin are not immune. Amanda is at her best acoustically. It would be a mistake to make too much of this, however, because all the songs on this CD are simply exceptional. Every song is a finely crafted painting by a grand master. One doesn't listen so much as observe them, pace back and forth in front of them, peer at them, and then finally sit down on the museum bench and gawk. American Songwriter ranked \"When You Need a Train It Never Comes\" at #5 but honestly this year they seemed to be obsessed by songs with controversial topics and I guess suicide fit that bill. Swimming, Ghostbird, and Shake the Walls are all superior.Another nit picky point is that while the overall collection of songs is superior to West Cross Timbers this collection doesn't have a breakout song like Mineral Wells. Ghostbird possibly comes closest. To be fair, though, even the best artists can only expect to write a song like Mineral Wells a few times in a career.The cover of Detroit or Buffalo, the only cover on the CD, is nicely done and there is the final instrumental only piece at the end, an effective touch.

{"text": "I only knew of Amanda Shires from her fabulous fiddle work playing with Justin Townes Earle out on tour. I had the pleasure of seeing her just four days ago (along with Justin and bassist Brin Davies) at the Philadelphia Folk Festival. So when I put on this new CD from Shires, I wasn't ready to hear that all but one (the last) track were vocals. And all the songs (except one) are penned by her.After two plays, I'm impressed! (It takes at least two plays as the lyrics aren't quite as obvious the first time around. And, luckily, they are all printed on the inside of the digipak.Shires vocals are quiet and soothing and she is accompanied by near a dozen Nashville-based musicians (including songwriter Will Kimbrough and album producer Rod Picott). Shires, herself, plays ukulele, \"strings\", and some whistling, as well as the violin.I'm reminded a bit of Lucinda Williams on a few tracks and there are hints of other young singer/songwriters here too. I know it's probably asking too much but I'd love it if she'd add more instrumentals to the mix. She's such a great player that her instrumental talent gets lost in the \"mix\". But then she'd have to give up some of her songs (with words) I guess.Anyway, I'm glad I got to hear her songwriting talents as well as watching her play on stage.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\"\n", "val": 0.005246392451226711}

{"text": "Being a fan of Egypt Central for a few years, I've heard the first album so many times I can't even count how many hours I've wasted listening to it. It was great, the lyrics and sound were just different to pretty much everything else I've heard.So when I heard in October that Egypt Central was going back into the studio to record a followup album, to say I was excited is an understatement. I was doing a happy dance when two of my favorite bands [EC & Adelita's Way] were releasing albums within a week of each other.Having pre-ordered White Rabbit and waited impatiently for it to arrive all of Tuesday, when I received the album and threw it on.. I was.. underwhelmed.I understand bands change, and they need to. When I placed my order for White Rabbit I was NOT expecting or even wanting Egypt Central 1.5, as long as they did what they loved I thought I'd enjoy it enough. I can say the same about My Chemical Romance, I love Danger Days as well as their old work.Ghost Town starts off decently enough, but dovetails within a minute into generic rock. All I can remember from this forgettable song was that the start was alright.White Rabbit is a standout track of only three on the entire album, but after repeated plays it really doesn't hold up and gets old, and the Elmer Fudd voice he uses near the end irritates me to no end. [Won't get what I waaannntt... what I deserveeeee...]Goodnight just feels like a filler track. It is one of the many songs on this album I couldn't tell you anything about. Nothing makes it stand apart from anything else.Kick Ass is one of those potential standout tracks, but it never really gets going and the heart-pumping anthem it wants to be falls flat. It's pretty much their fight song. Doesn't every band have one of those? [Sick Puppies - You're Going Down, Adelita's Way - Invincible, Mindless Self Indulgence - Lights Out, Rev Theory - Justice, Stroke 9 - Kick Some... you get the point.] It just never got going and fell to the side.Change is yet another song I couldn't tell you anything about. I listened to this album twice, against my better judgement. The second time through was a complete chore, but I tried to be fair to see if this would grow on me. Change didn't. I honestly can't tell you a single thing about it.The Drug (Part 1) was the most surprising thing about this album. It's the track that finally gives the album the kick in the pants it needs to get moving. Which might be because it's the only song that really feels inspired- the band members themselves have stated this song is about their drug addiction and definitely seems to be a topic they had strong opinions on. Enough to make what is really the only good song on the album.Of course, all good things must come to an end, and on White Rabbit that's clear. We get back to the forgettable, generic music directly after this all the way to the end. Do you guys really want me to just keep listing each song and saying \"Forgettable, generic.\" over and over?The final song, Backfire, is the mandatory slow song that every rock album has. Egypt Central had it on their last one, and you can probably point out plenty of these.The song is.... okay. It's that other \"standout\" track, and even then it just barely is. I can only recall the chorus.When I say the song is forgettable, I'm not just rating a song on if I can remember it after I finish listening, although that is pretty important. I rate it on whether or not I would want to ever listen to the song again, or if the lyrics are any good, or if the instruments blend. And no. I wouldn't. All but three songs on here feel like filler tracks in every way, shape and form that they just had to throw them on to the disc in order to get a decent amount of songs.It feels like they're playing it safe and just playing tame, friendly rock songs. I wouldn't say they're going \"mainstream\", that's stupid. They definitely didn't give it their all with this one, though, and that's clear. Uninspired songs and an overall forgettable album is what White Rabbit ends up being, and I couldn't be more shocked and saddened about that. Egypt Central had a sophomore slump.You'd be better off playing their first album repeatedly for the next few years until their next release. Let's see if they can get it right with the third album.\n", "val": 5.099512782180682e-05}
{"text": "When I first saw \"Egypt Central: White Rabbit\" pop up on my XM radio back in February, I did a jig in my car and got stoked for the full release.  Upon my first previews of the rest of the tracks, I wasn't overly excited but I hoped that the album as a whole would be better when I got it.Unfortunately, I can't say that White Rabbit is anywhere near as strong a release as was their debut album.  It's not a complete failure, mind you, but as others have also noticed, the lyrics aren't as interesting and the guitar work (IMHO) sorely missing Heath Hindman's and perhaps D'Abaldo's presences.  This amounts to a pretty mediocre release from a band who's been known for aggressive, catchy, and unique songs that you can't get out of your head for days.  I've listened to White Rabbit only 4 times through now, having had it for over a week (preorder came early at least :-) ), and I find I come back to it not because I'm drawn to it but because I want to love it the way I loved the debut from the very first minute.Now, I acknowledge that bands have to evolve their sound and message as they grow as a band; this album just feels more like slipping into mainstream than staying on their original \"path.\"  10 Years is another band who has fallen prey to this slide: very unique debut, a still characteristic sophomore with some mainstream sprinkled in for accessibility, and a shamelessly mainstream third album.  Don't get me wrong, mainstream doesn't mean BAD, it's just disappointing to see individualism in bands who catch your ear slip into the mold as the industry sinks its teeth into them.  (Digital Summer, for example, is a band who has remained dead-center on their independent path set by&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/their-first-album/dp/B000OYCBXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">their first album</a>&nbsp;and impressively expanded upon in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/their-second-album/dp/B003N7G9DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">their second album</a>.)Just because most of the tracks are take-it-or-leave it, these are the stronger tracks of the album:2. \"White Rabbit\"4. \"Kick Ass\"7. \"Down In Flames\"11. \"Surrender\"The rest are so-so (YouTube `em).

{"text": "I couldn't wait for this album to come out after hearing the single White Rabbit. It seems like ages, probably because it has been, since their first album came out. After listening to the clips Amazon provided I decided to give it a shot even though the other samples (besides White Rabbit) didn't sound too good.Let's just say I was incredibly disappointed after listening to the entire album and I tried doing it three times! It just lacks the rich lyrics and unique characteristics of the first album. I could actually say that EVERY song from their debut album was a hit. White Rabbit has just the one self-titled chart topper.I don't recommend purchasing this album, it's just not worth the 1 or 2 decent songs, especially when you can just buy the singles. I judge an album by whether or not at least 50% of the songs on it could be considered hits and don't think you should buy an entire album unless it meets such criteria.\n", "val": 1.9544691895134747e-05}

{"text": "I am relatively new to Egypt Central. I remember when You Make Me Sick came out...I liked it, but never picked up the album. Figured I would give them a shot on a recent outing to pick up some new music.  I intended to pick up the first album, but the store only had White Rabbit (I know, who goes to the store to buy music anymore, right?).Anyway, to the album: As a whole I like it, but it takes a very long time to grow on you and even longer to remember it. It is largely an album that I have trouble recalling, but when I put it in the CD player in the car I'm like, \"Ok, I'm digging this, this is good stuff,\" but after I get to work, by the end of the day I forget a lot of it again. There are some great songs to be discovered though, and they will stick a bit better than others.  The best thing about this album is that John Falls has some brilliant lyrics that hit home, and his choice of conveyance is genius at times (though sometimes over-dramatic and teenage angst-y). Let's talk tracks:1. Ghost Town: 7/10 - This song is pretty good. I didn't like it at first. It's kind of a strange song, has a very strange feel, but that gives it character. It's hard to explain, you just kind of have to listen to it for yourself. Definitely the most different sounding track on here.2. White Rabbit: 6/10 - The single is one of the weaker tracks on the album in my opinion. The main guitar riff and chorus singing pattern are very recycled and tired melodies that appear in countless other rocks songs. Trivium's \"A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation\" to name one off the top of my head.  That said, I wouldn't necessarily skip it, unless I had a short drive...then it gets skipped for the better ones.3. Goodbye: 8/10 - This is a great deep sounding song.  Good song for anyone who has lost something or someone, in any sense. I knocked two points off of this one because I find the opening clean guitar melody a bit unimaginative and elementary, but it gets better once the pre-chorus hits. If I was on a short drive, this would be the first track.4. Kick Ass: 7/10 - Another single, and again, a bit weak in my opinion. Then again, I don't really like party-rock songs, and this is definitely one of those anthem-y songs.  That said, it has some punch, and again, I wouldn't skip the track unless I have a short drive.5. Change: 9/10 - Great song. I wish the opening riff went for another measure, because it rocks, but it's still great.  The versus are good all around. The choruses are good minus the bleed-in sound of strings being strummed. The bridge is epic and perfectly done. The end bleeds a little metal in with a bad-ass breakdown. Song meaning and lyrics are good for someone who needs to change life course.6. The Drug: 7/10 - Hated this song at first. The lyrics remind me of being a teenager and having a bunch of adolescent angst back when Korn and nu-metal were all the rage. I've since come to enjoy this song, because it's raw and to the point, and admittedly feeling the most at peace with a few drinks in me, I understand what he is driving at, I just think he gets a little dramatic with some of the lyrics and could have been a bit more mature about it.7. Down in Flames: 7/10 - Good song, but would have been more effective slamming right in, without the boring preacher-esque intro. Versus are good, pre-chorus is awesome; When Falls sings \"You were all the same,\" his voice is strong and pleasing. Chorus is decent.  Good all around song minus the intro.8. Enemy Inside: 9/10 - Beautiful song. Piano is amazing, as are most of the lyrics, vocals and guitars. This song is billed as part 2 to \"The Drug,\" but it comes across more mature and less dramatic. Some lyrics are a bit teenage angst-y still, like \"Alone again with a razor blade.\" Don't mean to be insensitive, but pretty sure I don't know anyone over 18 that still cuts. That said, I have to give him credit for; \"I love the cuts that make the lines, arranged in beautiful designs,\" because that is an awesome line, even though it's still teenish. Other lyrics though are powerfully brilliant and mature, my favorite being; \"It's quiet now, like the moments after a murder. The younger me inside, can't believe the things he saw tonight.\" That is an amazing line. It says, \"An earlier version of myself that was brighter, happier and more naive can't believe what he saw, but the version of myself I am now isn't surprised by anything anymore because I'm so jaded, cold and hardened from life.\" Or \"Face to Face I'm screaming at myself.\" I picture who I was looking at who I am, and vice-versa. Powerful stuff. Overall 2nd best song on the album.9. Blame: 6/10 - It's a bit party-rockish. It's starts out like something you'd hear in a club, though the lyric is good: \"A lie is like a dirty knife, a jagged blade, and I can feel it in my spine.\" Falls is a good writer...I've seen this by now, but I'm not fond of this songs delivery.10. Dying to Leave: 9/10 - I enjoy EC's deeper songs a lot more, and this is another great one. The lyrics once again do not disappoint (Questions that build up like bricks stacked with anger). Vocal patterns are excellent, verse guitar melodies are a great contribution. The chorus, while still good, could have been better from a singing pattern perspective. The music begs for a simple soaring vocal pattern, and instead we have a somewhat rushed and wordy chorus. Less should have been more there. Still a great song though.11. Surrender: 7/10 - A more upbeat song, but not as party-rockish. Good song, but not terribly interesting. Nice to bob your head to and rock out on the road though.12. Backfire: 10/10 - This is the gem of the album. My god this is an amazing song. Easily in the top 50 songs ever created in the history of humankind. The lyrics are brilliant, complimented perfectly by a mood-setting key signature in the guitar. An incredibly emotional, hopeless and mature song about hating where you live because you know everyone, and have found out the people you thought were there for you have either stabbed you in the back or never really cared about you to begin with. You don't want to go anywhere, because you don't want to deal with running into people. It changes you, makes you colder, makes you hateful, makes you hate people...takes away your innocence, and everywhere you look, you are reminded of a painful memory or of a time when you weren't so cold and angry, and it messes with you. The final chorus breaks in with distortion, and it's so epic and beautiful.  This song is responsible for an entire star of the 4 I gave the entire album. So glad I found this song.All in all, as mentioned, I give this album 4 stars.Enemy Inside, Dying to Leave, Change: Account for 1.5 stars.Backfire: Accounts for an entire star alone.The other 8 songs: account for 1.5 stars.If nothing else, everyone needs to own Backfire, and I'd recommend Enemy Inside also.\n", "val": 0.0009245643159374595}

With regard to sound, I would describe this recording as a more melodic, power ballad sound similar to Hurt except that the lead singer has a distinctly different voice.  All of the songs alternate between hard rock | power ballads with above average lyrics and have less of a \"I need anti-depressants\" feel than most Hurt songs.  Not knocking Hurt, its just that the tone of this recording is more upbeat - while still keeping some anger | angst - than Hurt's style.All the songs are very listenable, and will likely hold up fairly well to repeated listening.Nothing earth shatteringly different, but very well played and produced.

{"text": "Ok, I have read some of the reviews and some people seem genuinely disappointed, but they shouldn't be. To me their first album was good but nothing special aside from \"You Make Me Sick\". \"White Rabbit,\" is two steps forward from where they were. This is album is evidence of not wanting to release a subpar record. The lyrical content alone has some very very personal and insightful content, I literally mean that some of these songs cut like a meat clever. The isntrumentation is tight although nothing ground breaking, although in this genre of rock and roll it is hard to truely stand out, simply due to the fact that people seem to be more enamored with the weirdo stylings of Lady Ga Ga and Justin Bieber. Egypt Central also fights the abundant trend of everything being synthed to death. When I listen to some other bands they sound like a computer was writing their songs. Everything is electronic and the zips and drum loops are mind numbing. Actual instrumentation is a dying art form if you really think about it. That is not the case here. It's guitars, a bass, and a drum kit in all their natural glory not a lot of crazy gimmickery.They haven't broken the mold but the lyrical content is that of a demented poet who is seriously afflicted. The lyric, \"I wish the sheets would suffocate me\" is defintely sad but it is strangely beautiful and poetic. That is a small example of the lyrical creativity that is scattered all over the album. In summary, if you like hard rock with a little insight and want to have an album that you don't feel compelled to skip tracks to get to the good ones then this album is definitely a must buy.\n", "val": 0.0054269228130578995}

{"text": "When I first read Don Was was going to produce this album for Michael Grimm, I knew we'd be in for a real treat, and after listening through this amazing CD, I can honestly say this is even better than I expected.  I really didn't like Grimm when I first saw him on AGT.  I saw the sympathy card come out, and the humble act (which, as it turns out, was no act) and decided to hate him.  Until he got past Vegas week.  I just couldn't not like someone with that much talent, and musicianship.The Sound:  If the engineering on the CD reminds you of a really well-produced Bonnie Raitt CD, there's a reason for that.  Don Was started producing for her back in the nineties - the one's that started winning the Grammies.  The vocals are close, and everything is intimate when it's supposed to be, and dirty  and loud when the mood calls for it.  What I find really nice is the balance between the various guitars and the amazing cool organ sounds.  This doesn't sound like a Daughtry album, or Top 40 rock.  It sounds like the \"blues\" and \"rock-n-roll\" that it is, almost like you're sitting 20 feet away in a club somewhere on the Delta.The Songs:  The covers he chose to record for this album are all fantastic choices.  Simple Man (Lynard Skynard), Stay With Me (Rod Stewart), You Don't Know Me (Eddy Arnold) are a few of the songs you'll find here.  These are amazing interpretations that channel every great blues singer & guitarist  that ever haunted a dive from Memphis to New Orleans.  With just a dash  of early Stones.  Nice that he can take familiar material and make them sound like brand new songs. There are years of hard earned experience in that voice.  Even when singing the ballads, there is carnal knowledge kind of grittiness that makes you think you wouldn't turn your back on this guy if he were within a football fields length of your daughters (or sons).  And not in a Lady Gaga way.  Grimm's own songs aren't filler either.  \"Suddenly You Are\" is my favorite.  A hooky ballad  - CD player on \"repeat song\" and I haven't done that since I was a kid.  I hope he records more of his originals as he gets more fame under his belt.  Everything fits together, without a single misfire.The Performance:  The man doesn't have to take his hat off for anyone.  Sun Studios, Chess, Elvis, Etta, Skynard.  He may not be a legend ...yet. (Give it a couple months!)  But I'd pay to see this guy in concert any day of  the week and twice again on Sunday.  Vocals are hot to the point of nastiness, and the guitar playing is legendary.Highly recommend.  One of the finest albums I've heard in a while.\n", "val": 0.010066130198538303}
{"text": "Grimm isn't as bluesy as he was on AGT (from his songs listed on another website, I didn't watch the show) but that isn't a negative. This CD seems to find all avenues of pop/rock and blues. A tad country, a tad honkytonk. Vocally, Grimm comes across as emotionally raw, exposed and vulnerable as if some lady hurt him pretty badly. Fallin' is truly brutal. It may be an Alicia Keys helmed song but Michael Grimm has clearly lived it a time or two. This will be an odd comparison but this CD reminds me of Josh Groban's latest, Illuminations, wherein JG tried something different with much less success. Voices do need to be great, as is Groban's, but material matters. Grimm, mixing in the other styles, nailed it.  While I am rating this as five stars but it isn't perfect. It isn't Grimms' singing or the production value that I find fault with - it's the duet with Ann Wilson nor do I care for song #6, Champagne and Wine. But I am more of a root beer and Aqua Fina kinda lady so that's just that. The duet with Wilson struggles because she doesn't seem able to keep up with Michael. It could be any back-up singer and I relish that song so it was a bit disappointing for me. The other duet with Travis Tritt, includes a vocal misfire by Tritt but it's still the better of the two. Even with the Tritt bobble towards the end. All in all, this CD is a reminder that America did pick the right winner last run of AGT. And I didn't even watch the show, just heard of MG by word of mouth. This is one sincere album.\n", "val": 0.0006295890198089182}

I haven't heard an artist like this in many years.  This is my kind of music and he nailed it even better than the original artists with his own style.  I bought this CD and his Grimm CD and must say I cannot get enough.  He's legend material as far as I'm concerned.  His style is his own, I relish some of his original songs too.

{"text": "All I can say is AWESOME!! What incredible emotion in that amazing soulful bluesy voice. Perfect blend of instrumental genius and brilliant vocals, delivered flawlessly, like a wave washing into the soul. The ebb and flow of the songs evoke a myriad of emotion - pain, empathy, elation, reflection, tranquillity, joy, excitement, passion, energy. Every song will move you either emotionally or you just can't help but move with the music. This cd was not pieced together like so many of todays music.  The musicians were all present inspiring each other to do their best and it certainly shows in the final product. Producer Don Was says \"Michael is one of the greatest vocalists I have ever had the privilege to record. He is a world class singer with a level of professionalism that is extremely rare.\"  Kenny Aranoff drummer for the recording says\" I haven't work with such a talented singer in a very, very, very, very long time.\" Country, Soul and Rock N Roll. A journey from plaintive gut wrenching soulful numbers, to romantic love songs, to fun just gotta move my body tracks. I challenge you to pick a favorite song from the CD. It will be the one to which you are listening at the time until the next song begins.

His Blues voice is just as powerful with soul that just doesn't quit.  Michael definitely IS NOT background music; his voice is much too compelling and I find myself completely absorbed in the emotion.

This is the latest solo single from Nicole, and honestly it is fair, but not really anything that truly seperates her from her Pussycat Dolls music.

I was hoping that there was more on the song that brought out more of the spark that could've broke her out more on the song, and the voice she has to offer.

{"text": "A well deserved 70th. birthday gift for Bob Dylan from the folks at Red House records. It features artists from their stable doing their take on Dylan songs- some quite well known, others not so. With Dylan, the choice is mind boggling when deciding what to cover.This disc is the follow up to the wonderful original \"Nod to Bob\" done 10 years ago on his 60th. birthday. That was also done by Red House, and had some of the same performers as this disc.Since Red House is basically a folk/Americana label, this disc comes from that direction. Nothing too heavy. It has some real legends- Spider John Koerner (Dylans old roomate in Mpls.)doing his usual funky romp on \"Days of Forty Nine\". Hot Tuna(Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady, etc.) doing a rollicking \"Mama,Let Me Lay it On You\" with a great fiddle part.It also has some newcomers like Meg Hutchinson doing a plaintive \"Born in Time\" and Danny Schmidt doing a beautiful reading of \"Buckets of Rain\".It also features some of Red Houses' folk vets- like Cliff Eberhardt,John Gorka, and Ray Bonneville who deliver their usual great performances. Lets face it, with the choice of material to choose from in the vast Dylan song book, it's hard to go wrong.I think this is a wonderful collection of some of Dylan's best done by some of today's best singer/songwriters/performers, who no doubt were all influenced by Mr. Bob himself. Highly reccommended.\n", "val": 0.024974793195724487}
{"text": "The original \"A Nod to Bob\" album was released ten years ago to mark Bob Dylan's sixtieth birthday. Unlike most collections of Dylan covers, which mix and match a fairly tired list of covers by pop singers over the last 40 years, that album included what were, I think, all new recordings by a fairly significant set of contemporary folk singers. For many listeners I think it may have provided an introduction to artists they might not have been familiar with previously, using Dylan's music as a bridge. On that collection, I particularly liked Spider John Koerner and Dave Ray's recording of Delia, which had a lot of character.Ten years later, we have a sequel to mark Dylan's 70th birthday. It includes covers by many of the same artists as last time -- Cliff Eberhardt, Eliza Gilkyson (a totally enjoyable live rendition of Jokerman), Guy Davis, John Gorka, Lucy Kaplansky, and Spider John Koerner all come back for the second round. There's new blood too -- Danny Schmidt (who totally nails Buckets of Rain, a song I never cared for in Dylan's version or the often heard cover by Bette Midler), Hot Tuna, Jimmy LaFave, Meg Hutchinson, Peter Ostroushko, Pieta Brown, The Pines, Ray Bonneville, Robin & Linda Williams, and Storyhill, are all new to the sequel disc.There's nothing radical here, but plenty of interesting and/or catchy renditions. Some dull ones too (Kaplansky's take on Every Grain of Sand is too similar to the original, I think), but that's what the fast-forward button is for.Happy birthday, Bob.\n", "val": 0.0020533259958028793}

{"text": "A collection of original songs from the early career of the Beatles that they did not record & release officially have been collected by a tribute band and presented as they 'might have sounded' had the Beatles released them. The result is well presneted and makes for intriguing listening and any Beatles fan will not be disappointed by the result. Some of the tracks never released by the Beatles are well handled - I'm In Love & It's For You. Others that were released by the Beatles in some form - I'll Be On My Way (BBC sessions), the 3 Decca Audition tracks, and You Know What To Do (Anthology) - do not sound quite how the Beatles would have principally because of the vocals. There is a distinct absence of harmony vocals and backing that was a hallmark of the early Beatles records which seems odd for the intention behind the project. But overall an enjoyable disc.\n", "val": 0.020381037145853043}
{"text": "I really enjoyed all of the other reviews here. If you haven't read them all, you really should. Everybody's enthusiam is well founded.I'd like to add just one thing. Most of the original versions of these songs, found on THE SONGS LENNON AND MC CARTNEY GAVE AWAY, were awful! Performed much to fast, and sung by some pretty bad adnoidal voices. The musicianship wasn't always the best, either. While I may still prefer the originals done by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas, Cilla Black and Peter and Gordon, the songs originaly done by the Apple Jacks, Fourmost, Tommy Quickly and Mike Shannon and the Strangers are so improved here they're hardly the same songs. This will be the first time you get to hear these songs done well. And I have to admit, I actually like \"I Don't Want to See You Again\" better here.Some of these songs weren't exactly the Beatles' best compositions. You pretty much get what you may expect from a song titled \"One and One Is Two.\" But where some of the originals were awful performances of substandard songs, Apple Jam lends the tunes some credibility. Indeed a Dream Come True for long time Beatles fans like myself.\n", "val": 0.013178239576518536}

{"text": "This album is about what I expected. These guys don't sound spot on exactly like The Beatles, but they do sound like they love the music and are having a good time playing it. The songs are simple love songs from that era. They have a good beat and melodies you can sing along with when you are alone in the car and your teenage daughter is not giving you that look. Although the vocals are not perfect impersonations of Lennon and McCartney, they do have good voices and come up with some very nice Beatle-esque harmonies. I expect to give it a lot of play and would be curious to see if this is just a one shot effort from Apple Jam or if they have something more in store for us. I for one would like to see maybe some original compositions played in a similar style. I can imagine them sounding a bit like early Smithereens perhaps. We'll have to wait and see.

{"text": "As a Beatle fan, and a knowledgeable one, I was quite interested in checking out this cover band. The presentation is very neat. They go as far as panning out the stereo just like early Beatles records (that is too much if you ask me). I must say however that these guys do not sound at all like the Fab Four. I have a vinyl by another band called Bas Muys who did a much better job with these songs. Some songs are better than others, like I'll be on my way. There are what we might call 'historical' errors, like using 12-string guitar for songs form this earlier period. This way the arrangements are neither here nor there. The sound is not as compact as it should be. That being said, the record is enjoyable and I do not regret buying it.\n", "val": 0.004695231094956398}
{"text": "It's very cool to find some fellow musician Beatle fans that have gone to the extreme effort to find these undiscovered gems and to cover them in an authentic way for other fans to discover. The 3 stand out tracks oh here are I'M IN LOVE , YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO and ONE AND ONE IS TWO. These are most convincing versions with superb moments such as the falsetto harmony \"Every little thing that you do-oo\" in I'M IN LOVE. APPLEJACKS best comparison is Bas Muys who's 1989 album \"Lennon & McCartney Secret Songs\" has a little edge over Off the beatle track. TIP OF MY TONGUE,FROM A WINDOW ,IT'S FOR YOU do not stand up to Bas Muys approach and have some jarring moments as well as unadventurous guitar solos. The Applejacks need to think like a Beatle when they approach guitar solos and be more creative. The version of NOBODY I KNOW is the best I've heard yet but still I would have loved drums and a 12 string guitar solo to have been included maybe in the style of \"I should have known better\".I wish they'd done the same treatment with WORLD WITHOUT LOVE ( I still have yet to find any cover of this song that really beats the Peter and Gordon version that has Paul McCartney all over it!) The danger with covering and playing variations with the songs LOVE OF THE LOVED , I'LL BE ON MY WAY and LIKE DREAMERS DO is that although the originals may have lacked the style of \"Hard day's night\" era , they still held a charm which has been lost by these covers. Like dreamers do is the low point of the album for me . Pure sacrilege! skip it and go straight to HELLO LITTLE GIRL which is a superb version all round . BAD TO ME is again a really true version but this song says to me that the Applejacks need to find a little more of Johns vocal tone and use it as the vocal tone here is more tonally that of Pauls.OVERALL an excellent effort which deserves recognition if only due to the stunning version of I'M IN LOVE. These guys just needed to rethink the guitar solos and bring a stronger John vocal tone to the table but I do appreciate this is easier said than done.\n", "val": 0.005441926885396242}

{"text": "If you own all the Beatles' albums and you wish there were one more to hear, you should buy this CD. The songs are all Lennon/McCartney compositions, and are excellently performed and quite true to the Beatles sound. Apple Jam doesn't come off as a standard tribute band; it sounds like they're having a great time playing these songs, and the singing and harmonies are consistently fine.However, you should also know that listening to this album will tend to confirm any suspicions you may have had about John and Paul saving their best songs for their own band. Simply put, there's a reason they chose these to give away -- they're just not as original or interesting as the songs on Beatles albums of the same period (\"A Hard Day's Night,\" \"Beatles for Sale\"). They're still good, they're just not THAT good. And they weren't intended to be listened to in one sitting -- they were all single songs given to different performers, so the careful sequencing and variety that is part of what makes Beatles albums great is missing here.These tracks are interesting in part because they reveal the Lennon/McCartney team figuring out and building songs, drawing from their influences and ringing changes on them. You can hear them teaching themselves how to do revolutionary things, even if the revolutionary things themselves aren't here.A very worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in the Beatles or in the history of rock music and songwriting.\n", "val": 0.003116615815088153}
{"text": "A new Beatles album out in 2009 with 15 tracks written by them?Impossible ! you say. Not quite.A Seattle-based band called Apple Jam has recently put out a CD called Off the Beatle Trackwhich comprises 14 Lennon-McCartney songs and one by George Harrison. They were songs written mostly around 1963/ 1964 and with three exceptions  - Hello Little Girl, Like Dreamers Do  and You know What to Do [ which only surfaced on the Beatles Anthology in 1995] were never recorded by the Beatles. Instead, with the exception of the track I'm in Love, they were given to other artists like Cilla Black, Peter and Gordon, Tommy Quickly and Billy J Kramer and the Dakotas who enjoyed varied chart successes with them.But it is not just the material that is new to one's ears. It is the way Apple Jam has produced it. They sound just like the Beatles: the guitar riffs, the harmonies and falsetto notes - even the album cover bears a striking resemblance to that of the first Beatles LP, Please, Please Me.The sleeve notes make the point that as a compilation it could have been put out  between the second and third Beatles LPs, namely, With the Beatles and A Hard Day's Night. The tempo, arrangement and young love theme of the lyrics closely resembles those albums. High energy, upbeat tunes like I'm in Love, Tip of my Tongue, One and One is Two sit snugly alongside great ballads such as World Without Love and Love of the Loved.Apart from the previously unheard material that came out on the Anthology series in 1995 / 1996, Let It Be was the last album the Beatles released. That was in 1970. Playing Apple Jam's Off the Beatle Track is evocative of the thrill and fascination one experienced all those years ago when a new Beatles record came out. Thanks to Apple Jam it's possible to have those feelings again - 40 years after the Beatles disbanded as a group. Fantastic!!  - Duncan Du Bois, Durban RSA\n", "val": 0.011690091341733932}

{"text": "It is clear from the first note, that Elena Tonra, the voice behind the UK pop-folk duo Daughter,  is not out to be anyone but herself. His Young Heart is an album of simplicity, honesty, and charisma. It is real. It is not flashy, but will stick with you long after the album is over- and that is what makes it a success.They start out with lyrics that are beautiful and poetic, yet blunt and pointed. On \"Landfill,\" Tonra is able to sing how she `hates your guts,' without sounding trite, but rather delivers a certain sadness and finality showing she is ready to move on. On \"Candles,\" she sings that she `has a little voice to speak with.' However, her `little voice' says more in four songs than most do in a lifetime.While listening, she is able to bring tears to the eyes of anyone with a heart, yet give a sense of freedom from the sadness by the end. In a market that is overly saturated with indie-folk artists all trying to get in their two cents worth, Daughter should be given far more than a penny for her thoughts. The delivery is pitch perfect, sincere, and soul-baring in a way that is often overlooked for those delivering flashiness and trippy beats.The only downside of His Young Heart is that it is an EP, as it deserves to be a full-length effort. It feels as though it is over before it began, yet one can tell Daughter has so much more to say- and, believe me, you'll want to hear it. What is unbelievable (besides the fact I overlooked this album for almost a year) is that this duo has yet to be picked up by a label. Although, one could argue that perhaps some of their charm would be lost in over-production. So, for now, we must take what we can get of Daughter and savor every last, hauntingly beautiful note.\n", "val": 0.01042744517326355}

{"text": "All manner of rare recordings and bits and pieces of new information are surfacing in this centenary Mahler year.  This particular recording was made form a heretofore unknown live performance in the Vienna Musikverein in 1964 with two of the world's greatest singers in the prime years of their brilliant careers.  The Vienna Symphony Orchestra is conducted by Josef Krips and though at that time he was a very popular conductor in Vienna, Mahler was not his specialty.  He nevertheless had the foresight to call upon the premiere singers of his day to record DAS LIED VON DER ERDE - tenor Fritz Wunderlich and Baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.  The result is one of the most exalting and sensitively sung performances of this work now available.Wunderlich's crystalline voice is pitch perfect and sails with ease into the high tessitura of his solos - enunciation perfect and his voice easily soars over this large orchestration. To remember that he died accidentally at age 35 only two years after this recording was made makes this an even more treasurable CD. Fischer-Dieskau is one of history's great Mahler interpreters and here we are given the opportunity to hear him without any of the mannerisms that tended to color his performances later in his life.  Hearing his thoughtful poetry and beautifully phrased singing in these songs is akin to hearing them in reality for the first time.  He is a master here and a gold standard for any young baritones who wish to study and perform this work.We are indebted to Deutsche Grammophone for rescuing this tape from the Krips estate and transferring it to CD for the world to hear.  It is magic.  Grady Harp, August 11\n", "val": 0.018467579036951065}

{"text": "I must say that this recording won me over before I even listened to it!  I knew it was going to be one of the top five.  Now that I have listened to it numerous times, I will admit it is my absolute favorite and IMO the greatest interpretation on disc!Wunderlich is pure magic and overwhelming throughout! Dieskau is inspired as I've never experienced him!I must completely disagree with \"Santa Fe Listener\" about Krips and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra being mediocre, etc.  I feel the exact opposite!  If you know Krips from his wonderful and magical recordings of Mozart, you will notice he brings that same crystalline beauty, refinement and spontaneity.  He seems more invigorated and passionate than ever!  It's noticeable that he loves this Mahler score deeply and his players too.  Even though the orchestra is not one of the most \"famous\" ones, I love the committed, inspired and rustic playing.  The orchestra knew this was a very special event, and also rose to the magical occasion.In regards the sound quality, it must be one of the greatest live mono recordings I've heard to date.  Clear, spacious and full of depth.  The voices of Wunderlich and Dieskau are caught beautifully as well as the Vienna orchestra.I'm ecstatic and incredibly thankful to DG for releasing this Das Lied von der Erde, which I know will go down in the vaults as the greatest performance this work has ever had!I will never tire of listening to this glorious performance (I've already bought a copy for a friend as a gift!), and I'm sure you will be as ecstatic after you hear it as well!\n", "val": 0.03645872697234154}
{"text": "This monaural radio broadcast of Das Lied from 1964 has been released on the allure of its two famous soloists, and how you react to it will depend almost solely on them. Josef Krips was no Mahlerian, and he barges through the score without heed for its subtleties. The Vienna Symphony was not in very good shape at the time, but the musicians follow Krips's urgent beat and get through the score without embarrassing themselves. The engineers knew better than to focus on the orchestral part, however. Wunderlich and Fischer-Dieskau are planted front and center. The close-up miking would have been treacherous for most singers, but what could have been a detriment turns into a shining example of almost magically perfect singing from Wunderlich.In his great recording under Klemperer on EMI, the sonic perspective is more realistic, and there are moments when the orchestra overwhelms the singer -- as any listener can attest, in concert it's a rare soloist who can be heard distinctly in the first song, \"Das Trinklied von Jammer der Erde,\" but Wunderlich gives us every note with perfect pitch, impassioned delivery, and excellent diction. The same holds for Fischer-Dieskau when he enters in the second song. Arguably he didn't record a great Das Lied, although there's a fine one under Kletzki on EMI and a famous, more controversial one under Bernstein on Decca where both singer and conductor fairly drown in self-indulgence. F-D is in such resounding voice and gives such musical attention to every phrase on this occasion, however, that even a committed non-fan like me cannot help but be impressed.One doesn't really need details about each song, since the soloists never flag and Krips never improves. this will always be a half-a-loaf performance, but if you love these two singers, their half is wonderfully sweet. We've heard nothing like their interpretations in the past five decades. The sound starts out a bit gritty in the final \"Abschied\" but is otherwise quite listenable -- every horn bobble comes through crystal clear.\n", "val": 0.008611318655312061}

For the most part (with only \"Skinny Dippin'\" as the exception), the hooks and ideas are strong, but none of the songwriters on this album could turn them into quality songs. \"Last Supper\" (About the final meal a couple shares together) and \"Liar\" (A girl watching her friend (a man) get married to another girl) have especially good topics and perspective, but those topics and perspectives aren't used as potently as they could've been, and the songs shakily meander along, never living up to what they could have been.As I said in my review for Hunter Hayes' album, wait for their second album.

{"text": "This is the best overall album I've listened to in a while. I don't buy many albums because I rarely like the majority of songs on a CD. I bought Eden's Edge on a whim when it was on sale because I liked their edgy sound and a couple of songs hooked me. I bought the album for \"Skinny Dippin'\" which may be on the precious side, but has fun lyrics and energy. I saw the band's live performance of the song on youtube and I strongly recommend watching it because lead singer Hannah Blaylock puts so much personality into her performance. I also liked \"Amen,\" which was their breakout hit. It has a catchy tune and a cute story.But after listening to the album a few times, I found songs I liked even more. \"Swingin' Door\" and \"Too Good to Be True\" have a similar theme and rock edge but they're both so good I regularly listen to one right after the other.  \"Feels So Real\" is a slower song done right. It maintains a softer emotional connection to the listener that prevents the song from becoming boring or too saccharine. \"Who Am I Drinking Tonight\" is a great song for getting ready to go out - high energy, sung brilliantly, and puts you in the mood to dance.\"Christ Alone\" is beautiful but not something I want to listen to often. \"Last Supper\" and \"Liar\" are not my favorites but are still good songs. I think \"Cherry Pie\" is their only miss on this album. It follows the trend on country CDs to have at least one overly sentimental song. I'm not usually a fan of those songs and I didn't like this one.I highly recommend this album. I think the band has fun energy, inspired lyrics, and a great sound.

{"text": "I was listening to Bernhoft's interview on NPR (23 June 2013) and was instantly hooked. If you like soul/funk/R&B, this is an album to get. Each track showcases Bernhoft's instrumental, vocal, and songwriting talents. His ease of style is just brilliant - soul just resonates throughout. Love it! My favorites are \"C'mon Talk (Live)\", \"Stay with Me\", and \"Shout\", a cover of Tears for Fears' hit song.I gave the album 5 stars, but I really would have liked to hear more live tracks. Getting to hear Bernhoft's technique in building loops and his multi-instrument talent in action is a real treat. Who knew a Norwegian boy had this much soulful swag! Keep 'em coming.\n", "val": 0.048378679901361465}
{"text": "I can't say enough about Bernhoft. He is the full package.He has a mind that competes with the best producers or composers out there when it comes to instrumentation.He has the raw talent that allows him to actually channel his vision of the song into the various instruments and sounds he creates.To top it all off, from his low low notes to his incredibly high and smooth falsetto, his vocal abilities exceed most singers out there.I've been obsessing over this artist since the first song I heard and after seeing him live last week, I can definitively say he's the real deal. His show was incredible. He is personable and funny at times while never forgetting while he's there. The crowd was engaged the whole night from the moments where he played favorites to the improvisations to the singalongs and covers. It was a top 3 best concert I've seen... and I go to 100+ concerts per year.Unbelievable.\n", "val": 0.044188935309648514}

So I had to buy the album...now I have it on my Cloud player...always ready! Great music. I hope he won't mind the comparison, but it reminds me a little of Robert Cray's album \"I was warned.\" One of my all-time favorites.\n", "val": 0.006004773546010256}
{"text": "My first experience seeing Jarle Bernhoft was on the Ellen show, where he wowed everybody with his skills on a looper, two guitars, and his own man-made percussion sounds.  All of us within ear-shot thought \"wow, this guy makes a heck of a lot of music all on his own.\"  But what happens with Bernhoft is that the music STAYS WITH YOU.  You're humming the music around the house.  The songs are in an endless loop in your head as you go to sleep, and they're still there as you wake up in the morning.  An artist hasn't had this kind of affect on me for a loooooonnnnngggg time.I, and about a million other people, have been spending my time since hearing Jarle on the Ellen show listening to him on YouTube, and seeing his great variety of style.  It's like watching music that could have been recorded forty years ago, but with a lot of current twists.  \"C'mon Talk\" was the first song that America was privy to through the Ellen show, and it is a spectacular, soulful song.  But as I picked through the variety of video available on YouTube, my favorite became \"Choices,\" which is THE song that I literally cannot get out of my head.  But there are others out there that are close to as good, and after watching everything on YouTube that I could find, I have come to realize that this man's musical potential is mammoth.The CD is interesting.  If you're a real Jarle Bernhoft fan, than you'll probably like it no matter what.  I like it, but I am disappointed that the arrangements are not the same as what I've heard on YouTube.  Bernhoft is obviously in a studio making this CD, and the sound is overly \"produced\" for American ears.  It may be appealing to European minds, but to me, it was almost jarringly disco-ish.  Not exactly, but close.  I would recommend that, in the future, keep to the simple, pure Jarle Bernhoft sound, and you won't go wrong.I would highly recommend this CD, not only because it is musically sound, but also because I want to support Bernhoft and his type of music -- I basically want to see more of this in the future.  It's really reassuring to see somebody who has skill, charm, and innate musical ability on the horizon.\n", "val": 0.005080857779830694}

{"text": "I don't review songs often as their likability is nearly pure subjectivity, but I guess I'm in a mood. I first heard a brief snippet of the song as a piece of outro bumper music on the Michael Medved Show. It was the ~15 second whistling section. You know, the good part of the song. When I discovered the name of the song, I gave it a listen, but only after reading about Foster the People on wikipedia. That was a mistake. To summarize: A trio of excrable, self-important youth. I take comfort that life has a way of smoothing the edges and perhaps it will do so to them and me over time. The song itself is a catchy several notes of chorus wrapped up in some forgettable segments of filler and highly modulated voicework. If I can comfort anyone close to the band that reads this, the previous sentence describes an awful lot of music and the youth should not feel picked upon.The Good: The whistling section alone is worth the purchase price. I would like to find an edit that has this portion on a three minute loop.The Bad: This is actually the reason I wrote this review, as I take a certain perverse joy in criticizing others: The words of the chorus represent perhaps the biggest wasted opportunity in lyrical fun in a decade, all because the band wanted to say something. \"All the other kids with their pumped up kicks...\" so much promise, so little that follows. I invite the listener to replace the ellipsis with something other than the actual lyrics of the song.\n", "val": 3.887915954692289e-05}

{"text": "Jason Derulo may forever be trying to recreate his number one smash 'Watcha Say'. Why wouldn't he? After all, the Imogen Heap sample was quite brilliant, with his vocals more built around it rather than the other way around.'Don't Wanna Go Home' samples two different songs, leading to a bit of a desperation to earn a hook. However, it works here, due to the more obscure nature of the two tracks in question, and the fact that they are integrated a bit more subtly than on 'Watcha Say'. The lyrics don't lend anything new to the pop music scene, in full-out party mode since what seems like the dawn of time these days (or before Tik Tok became the seventh most downloaded song ever). With that being said, there's nothing wrong with this single; it will easily propel Derulo into the Top Twenty once again, as it seems to have already done.The bottom line is that Jason Derulo's new single is a good, faceless piece of pop worth dancing to. It's not the song that's going to earn him any credibility or establish his image, but it is going to keep people from leaving the party early, and that's all he really wants to do anyway.\n", "val": 0.004724264610558748}
{"text": "In the last couple of years the popular music charts have seen an influx of male, American R&B singers, all singing the same kind of generic, auto-tuned pop mush aimed at the sort of people who think writing \"LOL\" is an acceptable form of communication. These popstars are all largely forgettable, interchangable figures, with very little distinguishing features to actually tell them apart; this Jason Derulo idiot likes to sing his name in every song, Neyo likes to wear a hat in every video he's in and Chris Brown likes to beat the snot out of his girlfriends. It'll be a good few years before they all presumably upgrade to the sort of full-blown, urinate-on-jailbait lunacy R Kelly made hilarious. Can't wait for that.So while none of the above have appeared in The Curmudgeon's Official Room 101 of Amazon, that's not to say they've appeared on anything even approaching good, it's just I could never work out who was singing what. Songs about clubs? Check. Songs about shawty's? Check. Instant desire to switch over to an artist with an actual personality? Check and mate. You can't blame a guy for being confused.I guess some credit, then, must go to Jason Derulo, who's finally managed to break into The Curmudgeon's definitive list of all that's wrong with the world with a song that makes you want to put your face into your hands and softly weep. \"Don't Wanna Go Home\" is, surprisingly, a song about being in a club (honestly, where DO these guys get their mind-blowing influence from? Never mind all that stuff about something evil knocking on your door or doves crying, this is REAL pop songwriting craft right here).So, what's the worst thing about this drivel? Simple. It's the utter unoriginality and no-effort of the song itself. As well as stealing lyrics from Lil Wayne and Lil John (and, really, when you're stealing lines from those two mental heavyweights it's time to consider changing careers), \"Don't Wanna Go Home\" has also cribbed the music from the Robin S 90's house track \"Show Me Love\". It's not so much an inspired sample as a \"hey, that sounds good. Let's just use that instead of coming up with a tune ourselves.\"  But the real crime, the most galling, \"oh, God, tell me they haven't\" thing about this (shudder) number one hit is the use of the chorus from the Banana Boat song. You know that \"Dey.. they say dey-o\" song? Yeah, that. But whilst that Jamaican folk song was centred around the workers in banana plantations who DID want to finish their backbreaking jobs and go home, instead we have some hateful rich kid who's popping champagne in a club and - heyyyy - does NOT want to go home. Ha ha ha ha. Isn't that just brilliant? Isn't that just SO clever? Isn't that just the sort of thing that makes you want to hit Jason Derulo with a car?A lazy, charmless, insipid song with no passion and no point, merely an amalgamation of past songs, lyrics and melodies performed by yet another bland, who-cares singer. Yet it's someone who a generation are being fooled into thinking is a superstar. I think not.\n", "val": 2.0353949366835877e-05}

{"text": "I became a fan of guitar instrumental albums in the 80's when Satriani released \"Surfing with the Alien\", I enjoy instrumental guitar that is presented in a traditional song format, in that you aren't missing the vocals, because they are there in instrumental form.  I don't enjoy guitar music that is a string of fast licks and even faster solos that really don't go anywhere.  This album by Pete Thorn is a cumulative rock guitar album that represents itself in the traditional song format, verse chorus, solo, verse chorus.  You are listening to a song!There are pop rock elements here \"Revenge of the Nerd\", \"Monster Movie\" some slower moments like \"Into the Ether\".The guitar tone is amazing, he is not only an accomplished player, but he puts alot of time into the tone for each of his songs, the notes really sing in \"Into the Ether\", they practically melt from the speakers, the rich chords and sweet twang in \"Homage\" (Hendrix, Vaughan), rich harmonics and clean backing chords in \"Velvet Fist\" puts me in the mind of some of Satriani's early work (Circles)Thorn really does go for it in that it's not just the lead guitar lines, but even the rhythm's are obviously fantastic guitar work, clear, clean with chorus/delay effects on \"10th Street\" make each individual note it's own voice (Eric Johnson fans will like this).I think if you are a fan of early Satriani, Eric Johnson or guitar as a voicing instrument you will enjoy this album.  My must downloads to recommend would be:\"Revenge of the Nerd\"\"Into the Ether\"\"Velvet Fish\"\"Promise\"One last note:  I 'discovered' Pete Thorn via Guitar TV.

{"text": "The Vaccines was certainly the hottest thing that happened to British rock in 2011. Sincere, to-the-point songs and the humorous art-rock attitude renders Vaccines as a unique breakthrough act. Arguably one of the best debuts in the last few years, \"What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?\" is a compilation of catchy, witty, and highly British, indie-rock anthems.I can see the point many of the people who don't like or denigrate this album are making. But for once, take your time and look at the current state of British music. To me, what has been very, very special about the music coming from UK has always been the wit, and the attitude it had. And by attitude I don't mean the clothes they wear. Vaccines' music sure isn't something you've never heard before, they're bringing back something that has been long gone; consciously constructed humorous pop music with delicate Britishness. Whether the sarcastic lyrical nods Justin Young makes (with his unusually-good-for-an-indie-band voice), or the anti-solo, minimal yet atmospheric, art rock guitar work by Freddie Cowan, this band has CHARACTER.People are free to have their opinion, but I'm pretty sure that overly-critical music snobs who deem this album as a repetition of the rock music history, go around on the web criticizing progressive artists for being too experimental. Pop music always scares the hipsters, and this is guitar-pop at its best.\n", "val": 0.030397415161132812}
{"text": "Vaccines sounds like everyone from Strokes, Interpol, to Heavens, The National, The Cribs to the Doves, We Are Augustines, you name it. Yet I feel like they stand alone as well. As a fan of many of the aforementioned bands, The Vaccines are a welcomed addition to my collection. I believe they are embodying a particular style and sound of a particular genre of this particular era that is obviously influenced by different bands of each era, dating back to the simplistic melodies of the fifties and sixties - so when people complain and argue that they are unoriginal, I'm not sure they have a good grasp of culture. None of these folks are completely original, only they find unique ways to express something that is already out there or on the cusp of being out there. But the way The Vaccines express this style and sound feels very genuinely emotional and personal. I feel like this is what makes bands in this genre stick out for me and I can't get enough of the Vaccines for the moment. That being said, I do believe that bands that offer or create an augmentation to the sound are creatively more admirable, influential and, in my mind, have more \"staying\" power. I am not sure The Vaccines really add or augment anything significantly to that point rather than just fitting comfortably within the genre. So while their tunes are stuck in my head at the moment, I would give them four stars for grasping the genre while maybe not taking it to that extra level.\n", "val": 0.006292801816016436}

They look clean-cut, sing out the anthems clearly, see time when they look over their shoulder and almost seem engaged. The Vaccines appear to reach for the lowest hanging fruit in a bid for stardom, but I can say that the disc got in my hands as an impulse buy as I was leaving the Sound Garden (Balt.) and it hasn't left the car deck since. The lone review I had read prior said they had smashed up against the rocks of the shores in the good ole US of A, and we have a way with crushing dreams of British bands, but if the well-worn paths of the stars mentioned above have an attraction for you, this permutation of those sterling examples might go down easy.

Usually, an album has 2 or 3 perfect songs if it is a good one, almost all of the songs are perfect on this one. Instantly 2 or 3 stand out like Blow it up, Post Break up sex and A lack of understanding; later on others stood out as strongly.I can't recommend them enough, they reminded me of being 20 and listening to Supergrass I should coco because their voice is just as strong , the feelings so unrestrained, just pure emotive energy.\n", "val": 0.006990358233451843}

The Ramones of the 21st century The Strokes aren't missed either in the suave `A Lack of Understanding\".

{"text": "Seems like every year someone is proclaimed in Q Magazine (my monthly purchase of note since 2000) to be the saviours/new darlings of indie rock. Sometimes they get it right (The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys), more often they get it wrong (Glassvegas a blaring example of expectations royally smashed). Last month (April, 2011) it was The Vaccines. Frankly, they're alright. This is not reinvention though. Much of it is what Arcade Fire playing Rooney (remember them?) with slightly racier lyrics would sound like. The lyrics themselves have (on the best songs) a consciousness reminiscent of Reverend and the Makers (indie saviours of late 07), but they seem to run out of ideas, trapped in what sounds like a rather middle class upbringing (as displayed in Somebody Else's Child). As a middle class guy of basically the same age I can hardly complain about this, but the confusion over relationships and illadvised sex is familiar enough to not need to be told about. I'd imagine this would appeal to the 'individual' indie teenager for whom the Arctic Monkeys are a little too jarring, Arcade Fire too monotonously pounding (i.e. boring) and for whom 'shagging their stoned family friend whilst everyone else is passed out downstairs' (I'm paraphrasing, but not much) and 'Post Break-Up Sex' are still unknown experiences. There are some catchy tunes, and some which positively scream their influcences (Wreckin' Bar could be a Ramones B-Side, whilst A Lack of Understanding has an unmistakable New Wave sound in Justin Young's voice which wouldn't be out of place in a Smiths cover band), but none of these are truely memorable. The problem is the likes of the Cure and the Smiths did this stuff twenty-five plus years ago and they did it better. It'll get some 16-18 year olds through the next summer of break ups and first concerts, but that's about it.\n", "val": 5.307597166392952e-05}

My only \"con\" with this album is that it is too short. I give it five stars anyhow. Great summer music. Great beat. The first song reminds me of the Jam \"Town Called Malice\"The Vaccines sound a little like James, The Smiths, The Killers and enough like themselves for me to say this is a great fun album and not derivative. I look forward to hearing more from them.\n", "val": 0.007753894664347172}

For those fans of melodic rock, similar to Daughtry except with a bit more of an edge, Adelita's Way is the holy grail.  Rick DeJesus and his fellow bandmates do a great job of hitting the rock tunes, like the debut single \"Sick\", in such a way that you quickly get hooked. Where Adelita's Way really sets themselves apart, however, is with their more emotionally charged ballads and mid-speed tunes. Home School Valedictorian delivers these songs in spades. \"Alive\", \"Good Enough\" and the power ballad \"Hurt\" prove that this band deserves everything good that happens to them.  Great music that I would highly recommend to anyone. Cant wait to see them live when they come to our town in September.\n", "val": 0.026435017585754395}

I'd say I've listed to every track three times now and each and every song is just great! The first single released, \"Sick\", is just amazing and I love \"Cage the Beast\". It's so great to finally get a follow up album to a band's debut release that doesn't stink. So many bands these days come out strong initially and then they just don't put out quality music after that, or they do something different on a follow up album that made them successful on their first. Definately pick up this release by Adelitas Way, it's well worth it!\n", "val": 0.03548778221011162}

{"text": "I was very pleasantly surprised when I heard this album; this is the one which should've followed Jordan's phenomenal solo debut way back in May 1999.  His albums in between have been anywhere from good(The Fix, Love Songs) to anything but(The Remix Album, of New Kids songs, was just a BAD idea; only the original demo for \"I'll Be Your Everything\" was even worth listening to).  Here, at last, is the album where he reclaims his solo career.  Another reviewer said it was \"boring\"; I don't understand that assessment at all.  There's a wide range of tempos and moods, from ballads to dance tracks, romance to lust and everything in between--even an inspirational song, which is uplifting without being preachy(\"Believe\").  \"Let's Go Higher\" is worthy of its status as a single; yet, there are so many other tracks which are even better.  My personal favorites are:1)the title track, \"Unfinished\", which I would like to see released as the next single.  A perfectly executed mid-tempo track which kicks into emotional urgency only as necessary, alternately hopeful and heart-rending;2)\"Up N Down\"(same title, different song than the one on Britney Spears' Femme Fatale album), a great sexy dance track which is neither prudish nor risque.  Jordan gets down and dirty, but still remains the gentleman.  Another top contender for a future single;3)\"Stingy\", another great mid-tempo track.  Funny title, but it fits and the lyrics are right on target--about being of two minds about a relationship;4)\"Inside\", a beautiful ballad perfectly sung by Jordan, imploring his love to let her guard down, he won't take advantage of her;5)\"Rockstar\", a fun, upbeat song about a real, confident woman who could be anyone's fantasy.Throughout the album, Jordan sings flawlessly, and that's without using the full force of his abilities.  There's just enough falsetto for those of us who love it, but without overwhelming everything else.  You can hear both confidence and contentment in every track; Jordan's back where he belongs, he knows it and he's glad to be there.  \"Boring\"?  Really?  I respectfully disagree.\n", "val": 0.006216582842171192}
{"text": "At one point, Jordan Knight was a teen \"heartthrob\" in the 80's boy band New Kids on the Block. Face it, \"Hangin' Tough\" was blaring everywhere.  Now in 2011, Knight finds his career past it's critical and commercial peak.  That said, Knight contributes a solid, if `copy-cat' effort on 2011's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Unfinished/dp/B004TB6GGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Unfinished</a>, which finds Knight putting his hand in a `grab-bag' of modern pop/R&B tricks.  To his credit, most of the `tricks' work in his favor as his superb tenor and falsetto are both still intact.  Unfinished never pushes the envelope to be considered revolutionary, but how many people do push the envelope in 2011? That's rhetorical by the way.\"Let's Go Higher\" dabbles in electro-infused R&B production and auto-tune; typical.  That said, \"Let's Go Higher\" is a fine opening cut and superb choice for a promo single for this effort.  The songwriting is typical for modern R&B, including a co-write by electro-R&B star Colby O.  This cut does work for Knight, but would have been just as much (if not more so) suitable for Colby O, Jay Sean, Taio Cruz or Jeremih.  \"Unfinished,\" the title cut, demonstrates a fine vocal performance by Knight.  The chorus is catchy enough, but not the most memorable anyone has every heard.  \"Like A Wave,\" produced by famed songwriter/producer Jonas Jeberg works reasonably well, without ruffling `many feathers.'  The bridge section is the highlight.\"One More Night,\" a Clinton Sparks/DJ Snake contribution, again relies on auto-tune for `freshness.' The electro-pop groove is a strong point here, not to mention the nice use of synths.\"Stingy\" is as solid (or average) as anything else, however the spoken word part is a bit odd, though distinct to this cut.  \"Kiss It Away\" is a personal favorite moment of the album, perhaps lending the album it's most authentic moment since, well \"Kiss It Away.\"  Produced by Ryan Tedder (One Republic, produced \"Halo,\" \"Already Gone\"), this cut is the type of cut one would envision Knight would revolve to in 2011 as opposed to some of the more electro-centric cuts.  The songwriting is great, particularly the chorus: \"Cause everyday you're tearing me apart,  so everything I gave you from my heart (kiss it away), you might as well just (kiss it away) so turn the lights and put your lips like this, and close your eyes, it's time to kiss our love goodbye...\" Knight sounds exceptional without ever sounding schmaltzy or unbelievable.\"Inside\" keeps Ryan Tedder aboard, though it is a shade less enjoyable than \"Kiss It Away.\"  The production is smart, with a nice easy-going vibe given off from this cut.  \"O-Face\" is catchy enough, if somewhat risqu&eacute; - well as risqu&eacute; as a forty-something pop star can be.  \"Rockstar\" is a `B' cut at best while \"Up N Down\" exploits how gimmickry has taken over pop/R&B in the 00's and 10's.  \"Believe\" closes the effort strongly, with excellent vocals by Knight.Overall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Unfinished/dp/B004TB6GGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Unfinished</a>&nbsp;won't be remembered as an `epic' effort, but it does keep Knight relevant.  Nothing strikes home as much as the Tedder assisted ballad \"Kiss It Away,\" but sadly most people will only be aware of this great cut if they purchase Unfinished.  3 stars.\n", "val": 0.003728969721123576}
{"text": "I freely to admit to being a huge NKOTB/Jordan fan. I have every album done by the group and by Jordan and will admit that Jordan was my first celebrity crush (I was seven when New Kids got big and he was 'so cute!'...plus we coicidently shared a last name). But aside from all that, I just enjoyed Jordan's music and feel this album is the best he's made since his self-titled debut album.Jordan has an incredible voice (though there's not a lot of falsetto on this album, which I missed a little) and it seems to resonate with so much emotion. 'Unfinished' is a powerful album that is also a lot of fun.This album is mostly upbeat with very catchy songs. I especially liked 'UpNDown' 'Rockstar' 'Let's go Higher' and 'Inside'. In fact, I haven't listened to the CD in a couple of days and 'UpNDown' is still in my head.Unfortunately, I didn't care for 'Like a Wave'. It seemed too young for Jordan. I talks about Spring Break and texting and I just started laughing. Maybe because I've been a fan for so long I just felt it was too juvenile for him. The chorus sounds amazing though...maybe if you don't listen closely to the lyrics it isn't as funny. I also didn't like 'Stingy'. I loved the lyrics but the chorus was a little off for me. Maybe it's the word Stingy, I don't know. I also found 'O face' very funny (and I doubt it was meant to be). It actually reminded me a lot of 'The Fix' which Jordan put out a few years ago.I still feel like the self-titled album was the best solo effort by Jordan, but this is a close second. I'm glad Jordan is still putting out music (and I really want another new New Kids on the Block album!). If you liked his first solo album, you'll love this. And if you're unfamiliar with his solo work, this is a good place to start.\n", "val": 0.0290980227291584}

This CD (11 tracks) has wonderful pop/r 'n b music & it's first single \"Let's Go Higher\" has been doing rounds for a while now. Stand-outs include \"Unfinished\" (a techno sound/r 'n b with a beautiful melody & vocals. This is the title track for this CD), \"Like A Wave\" (wonderful drumkit in this great ballad with incredble high pitched vocals), \"Inside\" (great keyboard pick-ups, melody & vocals), \"Rockstar\" (up-tempo track with synthesizer sound, great melody & harmonies) & \"Believe\" (a slow tempo track with beautiful melody & vocals). Great tracks include \"Let's Go Higher\" (a great first single from this CD), \"One More Night\", \"Stingy\" (mid-tempo track with some 'rapping' vocals), \"Kiss It Away\" (a ballad with great harmonies), \"O-Face\" (synthesizer sound) & \"Up N Down\" (great melody, similar to Usher's music/sound).

{"text": "What I liked:-The evenness and the flow of the album. Some of his previous sounded like he threw spaghetti on tne wall to see what would stick. Here, he has taken the effort to make a complete album rather than just another random, recorded experiment.-That he uses more of his full, chest voice rather than his usual over reliance on his falsetto. \"Believe\" is probably the closest he has come to belting in his entire recorded career.-That his voice was smooth and clear again, as he has sounded quite raspy in his last few albums.-Also to be noted is the beautiful emotion he has in his voice, especially the ballads. One of the few male singers with such ability and is criminally underrated as a vocalist.-That he is one of the few pop artists who can make a good uptempo song without resorting to Techno/Electro/etc., genres which I absolutely hate. (Even if \"Let's Go Higher\" is technically a Techno/Electro song, it doesn't set a precedent for the album.)-Best songs \"Stingy\", \"One More Night\", \"Kiss It Away\", \"Believe\".What I didn't like:-This album was a blatant attempt to appeal to the \"younger crowd\" and to appeal to radio, by his own admission. While a handful of songs here are genuine gems, some songs are rather beneath him at this stage of his career.-\"Like A Wave\" has to be one of the most annoying songs he has ever recorded. While I can ignore that I simply do not care for the peek-a-boo beat, I cannot ignore that the lyrics are incredibly juvenile. \"Rock Star\" falls in the same vein lyrically. While I like the production and vocals of this song, the immaturity of the lyrics kills me. These two songs almost sinks the entire album.-13 years into a solo career, I was hoping Jordan would finally make an album of depth and substance and he has not.While he seems to want to move away from the ballads, they are his usual strength here, whether he admits it or not. The ballads have much more emotion and depth while the rest of the album relies on in-the-club dance themes. He keeps repeating the same tried and true formula.While I do praise his ability to write a great dance tune, he seems to be stuck in a rut and needs to venture away from the tried and true formula that fills his albums. He has great potential as a writer and producer yet he has not shown any artistic growth since his debut album.Also, here's to hoping he doesn't take another five years for a follow up to Unfinished!\n", "val": 4.954217001795769e-05}

{"text": "this is a great album.  The more I listen to it, the more I love it.  For eleven songs, there's a lot in it.  There's a real sincerity presence in his voice that's disarming.  A lot of it is warm music, and the lyrics are subtle enough that I can actually listen to it with my kids around.The title reminds me of how Hangin' Tough (and it ain't over till the fat lady sings) was a comment on NKOTB's trajectory.  Unfinished suggests questioning or defying the completion of something ongoing, but this is Jordan's very first commercially successful solo album, really.The album starts strong with the popular addictive dance music hit Let's Go Higher.  This layered song is best played really loud, preferably with the windows rolled down.  Scratch that: it's high energy, so you'll want to dance.  It has just enough auto tune to sound cool.  Like all the other songs on the album (except Like a Wave), Jordan collaborated on the writing.The lyrics in the title song remind me of Bryan Adams' Run to You (a song supposedly about his love affair with his guitar) because I don't think Jordan's song is so much about an unfinished relationship as a song he's working on and emotions of the creative process:  \"maybe I'm just making it worse, but I can't let go...let's fix it\"...\"stop right there/take a breath/no it's not too late\"... \"how can you complicate what I see so clear\"... \"just think it over for a minute\", but I could be completely wrong.  By extension, I think the album truly was unfinished:  weeks after it was released, deluxe versions of these songs became available on iTunes (plus a bonus new song).  The most notable re-working was to \"Stingy\" which now features fellow NKOTB member Donnie Wahlberg's magic touch.  The Wahlberg version is warmer, sexier and smoother.  The quality of the new Stingy makes me wish Jordan would collaborate more often on new songs with NKOTB members.Like a Wave sets the tone for the rest of the album by pulling you into the deep end of a whirlpool of warm crooning...sorry, I got carried away by the water imagery and clichs.Four songs (that I know of) share their title with completely different songs by other artists.  I don't know if these titles were accidentally unoriginal or if this was deliberate, but it's striking.  There aren't any cover songs here.One More Night, right from the first few bars, from the first time I heard it, sounded like a hit single.  Now I can't get it out of my head.  One More Night has a polished sound, the vocals float over an easy melody, and there's something about Jordan's Boston accent...it sounds really good!  Rockstar could almost be like the new Dancing Queen:  listening to it makes me feel like I could be the Rockstar.  I don't know why the rock guitar bridge wasn't given more attention.  Up N Down sounds like the sort of song that would play loud as you strap into a crazy ride at a midway or amusement park.  Believe makes me want to.  There was a passionate intensity in Jordan's voice in this song, more so than in any other.  It's the sort of power and intensity that really shows how much Jordan's voice has matured and become richer over the years.  I think it points to things to come.  For anyone who hasn't heard Jordan since the fun dreamy positive \"Step by Step\" era, the 2011 Jordan is more of the same, plus deeper in every way.This is only the beginning\n", "val": 0.01061329711228609}
{"text": "Jordan Knight has had an interesting career over the last two decades. While he was best known as the frontman of the successful late 80's boy band New Kids On The Block, his career as a solo artist has seen a fraction of that success. In 1999, he released his self-titled debut \"Jordan Knight\" on Interscope Records while staring down the barrel of being 30 years old. The album featured the production talents of legendary hitmakers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis as well as a then-unknown Robin Thicke, and scored a huge hit with the raunchy first single \"Give It To You\". His album was successful, but didn't go as far as it could have- mostly because Interscope marketed the album as a pop record when it was really a blue eyed soul recording. Knight disappeared from public view for over five years until he returned with a trilogy of albums- a tribute disc on his former group New Kids On The Block, followed by the EP \"The Fix\" and the album consisting almost entirely of covers, 2006's \"Love Songs\". In 2008, he reunited with his group New Kids On The Block for their first album in almost fifteen years \"The Block\". He resumed his solo career in 2011 with his first studio album in five years- his first for the label E1 Music called \"Unfinished\".On Knight's new album, he delves into the electro and Euro-dance music that has been popular over the last few years. He drives the point home on the opening track- and the first single- \"Let's Go Higher\", which was co-written and produced by Akon protege Colby O'Donis. He inexplicably uses Auto-Tune on the title track \"Unfinished\", while getting sensual on the uptempo \"Like A Wave\". Hip hop producer/DJ Clinton Sparks handles the production on the house music inspired \"One More Night\", while \"Stingy\" bears an uncanny nod to PM Dawn's \"Set Adrift On Memory Bliss\". Ryan Tedder of One Republic produces two piano driven ballads- the break up centered \"Kiss It Away\" as well as \"Inside\". J.R. Hutson- who's best known for his work with neo-soul singers Musiq Soulchild, Eric Roberson and Jill Scott- produces the sexually charged uptempo track \"O-Face\". He sings of a mystery woman on \"Rockstar\" and closes the album with the staccato ballad \"Believe\". Overall, Jordan Knight's \"Unfinished\" is a decent record, but suffers from too a few uptempo tracks that sound out of place for him. As with every album by Jordan, the ballads are the songs that do his vocals justice. Despite that obvious flaw, the positives far outweigh the negatives for this recording.\n", "val": 0.0032163881696760654}

Dave goes crazy on Rapnzel and just keeps things at 200mph... every one is at the top of their game.

{"text": "Hours of waiting in lines to get in to both shows and for the chance to get a poster on the second day was well worth it. Having been right on the guardrail for the first show and just five people back from the stage the second night I can attest that this was the closest thing I have ever had to a religious experience (From an Atheist that is saying a lot). I have been to several DMB concerts and this one I will never forget. Even after the first show many of the people we met at the concert were saying the band would release the shows on CD. The second night cemented the idea into our minds because it was nothing short of epic.Jimi Thing was awe-inspiring, and if you listen closely to the crowd, every time the crowd gets louder when they are singing the first two verses was when Dave would walk up to the mic to start singing. After the volume picked up, Dave graciously bowed his head to the audience and let us keep singing. With impressed and awe-struck smiles and looks from the different band members it is for sure an experience that will always stick with me.The rest of the set list is just as amazing. With a mix of new hits and old classics, the band does a wonderful job of showcasing their musical talents.The quality of the recording for this show is impeccable, despite some reports of skipping issues from the first night in particular that were quickly rectified by the distributor (included in the double play box set sold on DMB's website). My only gripe lies with the fact that they cut out the crowd chanting for Last Stop shortly before they performed the song to finish the show, but in the grand scheme of things that is a very, very minor complaint (which was probably cut because of time). I have every live album the band has put out and this is in the top 3 as far as the quality of the recording goes.This is a live album that every music fan should have in their collection, not just DMB fans. They really gave it their all for their last show of the summer of 2010 and it comes through on CD. These guys never cease to amaze me and I can only hope along with other fans that they keep it up for years to come. Thank you for the music!*Just as a side note:-Props to Jason Mraz for doing a terrific job opening for DMB both nights. I gained a lot of respect for Jason as a musician and vocalist during those two days. That man has a voice any professional or amateur should envy, and the energy he displays alongside his band (the horn section in-particular) is incredibly entertaining.\n", "val": 0.035774800926446915}
{"text": "I was at this show in September 2010. The sound quality on the disc is amazing. The band is at their improvisational best throughout this high-energy performance. A perfect mix of new jams, old hits and a few rarities. Definitely worth picking up.\n", "val": 0.07243368029594421}
{"text": "I've been listening to a lot of DMB's live releases for a number of years now, and I definitely have my list of favorites.  However, I was not very impressed with the last non-live trax release (\"Live in New York City\").  I just didn't feel the energy that is so noticeable in other live recordings.  That is why I didn't have high hopes for this release.  But I was VERY wrong.  The most noticeable improvement is Jeff Coffin's saxophone work.  It is absolutely fantastic, and even parallels Leroi's work at times.  The music has a much more rock-like sound than it had before, but it really works.  This makes me feel that DMB has pulled out of it's confused post-Stand Up years into a new mature, dignified, and modern sound.  I never though I would say this, but it's a change that I like!  Overall, this is by far my favorite live release in years.  Saying that I am very impressed is an understatement.  I'm sure this will get pushed under the rug as just another live release to most people, but it is so much more.  Also, this album has a great mixture of both old and new tracks, and they finally seem to blend together.  The Big Whisky tracks sound much more polished than they sounded on \"Europe 2009\".  Just as a pointer, some other concerts I would recommend are Folsom Field, Weekend on the Rocks, Central Park (of course), and Live Trax Volumes 2, 13, and especially 14.  And now, Wrigley Field is on my list too!!As a side note, the version of #41 found on this album is one of the best that I have heard in a very long time.\n", "val": 0.029806198552250862}

I was hoping they'd release something on this concert because it was just that good. The CD sounds great and it will definitely be a prized DMB memorabilia to own.\n", "val": 0.06693942844867706}
{"text": "Here we have another prime example of DMB doing what they do best: live shows. This show is special for quite a few reasons, one being only one of a few bands to play the historic Wrigley Field and this being their last show of the summer 2010 tour. This release is the 2nd night of a two-night run, if you were a member of the Warehouse, you could have gotten both nights. Anyways, this show is incredible, for those who complained about the last release's sound issues(Live In New York), this release sounds amazing, and on a side note, I could not really hear any problem with the New York release, but I digress. The show starts with an explosive You Might Die Trying, a great way to start things off. Dave then slips in the always wonderful Stay or Leave and even bt the second song, you can tell this is a special night for the band and the fans. Dave does a partial Good Good Time, a nice surprise for the fans that goes straight into yet another incredible #41, and like every fan knows, Dave and the band always re-invent the song. There is so much energy in this show, it really feels like you're there in the crowd. After the incredible Two Step, Dave surprises yet again with the beautiful Christmas Song and ends the show with none other than The Last Stop. If you're a fan, just buy because you know it's good, if you're new, still buy it and see the magic that is DMB live. Dave and the boys still prove that after 20 years, they have no signs of slowing down or stopping what they do best. And if you're lucky enough to catch the Caravan this summer, I'm sure it'll be the concert of a lifetime!\n", "val": 0.01885235868394375}

Dave sounds pretty rough; maybe a little hoarse?  The mix isn't great; I think the drums are a little overpowering, for example.The arrangement is almost identical to the one on \"Crash\", but the performance and sound quality are worse.So, I already own three versions of this song, all of which are better than this take:1) The album version from \"Crash\".2) The version from \"Live at Red Rocks\", which is cleaner and a bit more interesting.3) The stripped-down acoustic version off \"Live at Luther College\".\n", "val": 0.00014974942314438522}

{"text": "If you want my opinion, the idea that this was held back for use as a FIFTH single is INSANE. A much stronger track than anything previously dropped to radio (from Born This Way, I mean here), MARRY sounds more like something from The Fame -- this sounds like a Springsteen-Jovi combo that got written on keys (instead of guitar -- note that the track is in C Major throughout) and kept slow (is this thing really only clocked at 64 BPM...?!!) -- this strikes me as an old Pat Benatar tune that might have been re-made by Donna Summer. It's all kinds of massive; the record EXPLODES from your speakers.I swear I hear a vox double just beneath the top vocal here; if you listen, you can barely discern a second vocal track that Gaga recorded into the red. This sounds, to me, as if it were then re-mixed in such a way that the two vox tracks are melded together. The buzzy, almost-in-the-red synth contrasts nicely with the church bells, although the funk breakdown going into the final earworm-shove strikes me as being of utterly no value whatsoever (I'll be the first to admit here that I have no better idea(s) for the break -- a guitar/sax solo simply doesn't fit, here). Gaga does hit a legit & clean E5 in MARRY; I think it's time to admit that Gaga actually does have a voice... I honestly suspect that one day, she's gonna release something with a MAJOR display of vocal power; I'm kinda curious if she's been sitting on a powder-keg of vocal force that she intends to shock everybody with (at some point). That would be cool to see; doing it live is the obvious crux.I'm gonna say once again here that MARRY really should have been the lead-off single, dropped directly to radio before the release of the album -- and then I'm going to shut-up about it. It's an exceptionally strong record that I actually don't hear a ton of ringtones within (re-mix potential here is huge, of course); what we have here is simply a song, that, to me, sounds as if it came straight out of 1977; perhaps a throw-away from Pat Benatar that got dug out of the Jovi vault and wound-up being re-made by some old random disco queen. Bonnie Tyler could have done this 30-odd years ago, you know it...?Yeah.4 stars.A solid effort.\n", "val": 8.72069867909886e-05}

This song is not lyrically, musically, politically, or stylistically ground breaking but the varied pacing (slower tempo during each verse vs a driving dance beat refrain) plus some minor variations along the way keep it interesting enough to the very end.\n", "val": 0.007716284599155188}

While most mainstream music artist touch (just barely) on the important social issues of today, Lady Gaga, in usual Gaga Fashion, tackles these issue very blatantly. It's refreshing to see an artist (for whatever the reason) not fearing voicing her concerns and hopes. It's a positive message that should be applauded.There is a lot of gossip surrounding this song, that, at least to levelheaded individuals is completely unfounded. This song was intended to upilft and normalize a group of individual who in our country (United States) has been grossly supressed. This song, while enjoyable by people of any age, is most importantly needed by the younger LGBTS people who need someone talking directly to them and helping them celebrate who they are without fear and self hatred.I applaud Lady Gaga on her direct message to these people in need.

Well, they have a right to their opinions.This song is an anthem for equality and self acceptance. Many people have a problem with this message, so they'll use any excuse to discredit the song of plagiarism, ripping off or being unoriginal. Ever since a child, I have been one of Madonna's biggest fans. She has been thrown under the bus several times throughout her career, so I find it hard to believe that so many people are now jumping to Madonna's defence. Maybe, there are some die hard fans that may have a problem with the likeness of the song, if any. Sure, there may be some people who just don't like this new direction she's going on. It's fair to say that they just don't like it. Let's be honest, many fear the message that she brings to the mainstream.I personally love how she is growing as an artist. She is trying different ways to express herself. Again, I don't see that as a bad thing. In closing, The song brings me back to my childhood. It's an inspirational and fun fast paced song.

Months later, though, once the bit of disappointment has worn away, it becomes apparent what a landmark this is for both pop music and our culture in general. How one feels about this track will likely hinge on how one feels about gay rights, as that is simply an unavoidable aspect of the single. To view this as simply a song isn't enough. What Lady Gaga has done here is create a pop song that promotes not only gay rights, but also faith in God within those rights. Never before has an artist said, \"Look, being gay is awesome, and God is awesome, so why deny yourself either one? Love who you are, because God sure does.\" People can ramble about the 'Express Yourself' comparisons all day long, and they are well-founded. However, this goes far beyond sonic components and basic song structure. 'Born This Way' spent six weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, and did so without compromising anything. This is a landmark moment in our society, when we realize that the public might just be on the track to embracing homosexuality, as well as believing that maybe God embraces it as well.

{"text": "Well, folks, we seem to have passed some great cultural milestone. Because when the rabid Bill Donahue appeared on Fox News yesterday, he seemed to debut a new approach or tactic on his part in how to deal with gay people in general, and gay artists particularly. Donahue clearly was aiming to appear very relaxed and with-it. And though he was there to complain about some statement by the artist about Catholicism, and particularly because it came during Holy Week, his general strategy was clearly a new one.. His complaints are hardly news, since that is what he does. But the fact that he spent a large chunk of the interview opining about Lady Gaga's obvious talent surely is news. Apparently the tech people on the Fox News Channel are Lady Gaga fans, because Donahue emphasized that he had been talking of the singer's talent in the green room with them, so bubbling over with appreciation for cutting edge gay singer stylings that it takes over his small talk no less apparently. So, I am not sure what this milestone means, but it means something. Perhaps a clue might be found in the fact that he further explained that Catholics just want to be \"left alone\". Well given that the Roman Catholic Church is decidedly not into leaving others alone in society by their various campaign, one wonders at the man's logic. But the rather fawning praise for the singer's talent tells us, phenomenologically, that the Church apparently feels that they now must make some sort of use of the gay artiste vibe. That is the real news. They have glommed on to every other fad in past  in an effort to make their rigidity current and more palatable, and jettisoned their own glorious traditions,  and apparently  now we will soon be treated to parish minstrels in holy drag, with tech songs about the Virgin Mary or Jesus. I have a suggestion where they might start to find performers, and it is with a little Papist, as he calls himself, at the rabidly right-wing Catholic Vote Action. With that connection the little circle of  reaction meeting with Bill Donahue's efforts will be complete.\n", "val": 0.0033461255952715874}

However, the fast, pace beats kinda takes away from the message and it just seems like another catchy dance song. And it is hard NOT to notice that the song sounds like 5 different songs combined as one. It's a little bit of Waterfalls by TLC, Vogue and Express Yourself by Madonna, God is a DJ by Pink, and When Love Takes Over by Kelly Rowland. There's nothing special about this song. I was certainly disappointed with this new single. Hopefully the other singles are better.\n", "val": 0.0001492939773015678}

{"text": "I am a Madonna fan tried and true before Gaga, way before Gaga.  I've been around the Madonna block for over 20 years so I know a thing or two about the Queen M.#1. If the internet diddnt blow up with comparisons, I wouldnt have linked \"Express Yourself\" and \"Born This Way\".  There are some similarities but I dare you to find ANY woman in pop music whos tree is not rooted in Madonna on some level.#2. Madonna has, through her 30 year career borrowed and stolen from COUNTLESS people she found inspiring.  Wasnt the \"Express Yourself\" song directly influenced by 'Sly and the Family Stone' and 'Earth, Wind and Fire'?  Wasnt the ENTIRE video not a direct rip off of the movie \"Metropolis\"?  Yes it was.  Do your research.#3.  I think Gaga borrowed Madonna's sensibilities more than the song itself.  Madonna has taken many ideas and reinvisioned them, released them and claimed they were her own.  Everything from video's to photographs to sound to songs to movies to live performances...  in fact, she has been sued MULTIPLE times doing this.  Do a Google search for 'Madonna rips off'.Bottom line... neither women are reinventing the wheel of pop music but both are extreamly facinating in their own right.  Gaga would be WISE to take some pages from Madonna's book, for obvious reasons. Personally I think the comparisons are a bit early and Gaga is still slightly sloppy in her craft (ie: live performances etc) but this will change over time.  I think an iconic pop artist has to be a succubus to pop culture in order to create their own pop culture.  FACT.The song itself?  Brave in the US.  Tired elsewhere.  Fun beat, catchy lyrics.  Innovative?  Hardly.  Still gets 4 stars because Ill always be a pop b**ch at heart, even if I am 30.\n", "val": 7.624724821653217e-05}

The song takes on too much of the feeling of Madonna's Express Yourself, with a pinch of Vogue. I really wasn't even impressed with the song at all. It really feels like she is trying too hard to be into the sexual appeal Madonna had shown for over 25 years, than being herself. I really think she needs to come up with something better for her music when her sophmore album comes up soon.

In my opinion, this song is to help our young people who may be having glbt issues, so the more blunt this song is the better it will work.  This is not a song to hear in a nightclub with 5 of your best gay friends at 2:30 in the AM, although I am sure it would work there.  It is a song to be heard by fifteen year olds on their Ipods at jet engine volume when they can't take it anymore.

Clarence really gave it his signature all, while Lady Gaga has felt like she has stumbled in stride.

Couldn't make sense of the mombo jumble that was it. Lady sez it better then I tried to.Thank you miLady lime & Lemmon lights!!Madonna was pioneer at being who she was, a strong force, that wanted the hurricane to wash over her.

But you roar girl cuz baby she was born that way. & now actress. Seems the directive to go. After everything falls into your multi talents path. Woman is amazing. I bow to you miLady not unlike the other Ladies of dance, merriment & song & more. Because there is no end when you have visited, where others dare to dream, halo effect does these performers well. Down load Edge of Glory right now, if you haven't. It should make you smile, as you dance, on clouds, & cotton candy roads.Not to down play the song that's just my dream vision.

{"text": "As much as I loved Born This Way (the album, not the song specifically), I think Lady Gaga has made some bad decisions with choices of singles. (Or maybe her record company made some bad choices of singles. It's hard to tell, since she seems to have a lot more control over her career than a lot of artists.) Either way, there wasn't a lot on Born This Way that was truly radio friendly.\"Born This Way\" was a little heavy-handed and possibly offensive with her choice of racial descriptions (i.e. chola, Orient). \"Judas\" was also possibly offensive and a little annoying.\"Edge of Glory\" was a real winner though. It's catchy, it's big, it's a more straightforward story. It's the kind of song that you can listen to in your car or home and sing along with and love. Releasing this as a single is the single smartest thing Lady Gaga and her record company did to promote her new album.This may have more mainstream appeal than anything else Lady Gaga has ever written.\"Edge of Glory\" has a building, later booming melody. It has a fantastic sax solo from the late, great Clarence Clemmons. What could be better than that?\n", "val": 0.0039001861587166786}
{"text": "The Greencards have come a long way since their first offering, \"Moving On\", which was a relatively traditional bluegrass piece. It was very good and those that decideed to take a chance on a ,then, relatively unknown band were rewarded with a nice mix of originals and covers. Now, four recordings later, the Greencards have  come into their own with a collection of songs that truly highlight their many talents. The songs are both inventive and captivating with Ms. Young weaving her beautiful voice seamlessly into the world class instrumentation. They borrow from traditional as well as contemporary songwriters but the heart of the album are the originals penned by Carol Young and Kym Warner. Supporting Warner, four time Austrailian mando champ, and Young on bass guitar who had two number one recordings on the Australian country music chart (and voted Best Female Vocalist) are two world class musicians, Carl Miner on guitar and Tyler Andal on fiddle. The sum of all this is a must-have CD for all who appreciate Americana music at its best.\n", "val": 0.0621480755507946}

I'm listening to portions of \"Fascination\" which I did not get, and it is better than this.  This is not bad, it is different, it is full of effects and strange effects. Carol Young still sounds good, I just loved the old \"vibe\" better.\n", "val": 0.00960509106516838}
{"text": "Don't get me wrong.  I am and continue to be a big Greencards fan.  I've purchased all their records, seen them live, and friended them on Facebook.  I've been waiting anxiously for this new record for some time.But now, I'm disappointed.  To these ears, it's not up to the melodic beauty of their other records.  Just listen to the first three songs off Fascination, and try to find three similar classics on this one.  On this whole record, the only song I felt was memorable was Here Lies John.  The instrumental before that, Adelaide, was brilliant and could easily receive them their third Grammy nomination.  But the other songs seemed more like fragments of partially conceived ideas that never really gelled.  You can really tell what you are missing when the hidden track, the last song on the record, plays \"Bury Me Beneath The Willow\".  It's a traditional classic bluegrass song, covered by many artists.  This is songwriting, and unfortunately they recorded it using a tricky mono technique to sound old fashioned, so it doesn't sound great on nice headphones.The positives...the Greencards are brilliant musicians and arrangers, and that still holds true.  The sound is impeccable as usual, and Carol's singing is still superb...although I missed hearing a Kym song.So there you have it.  I just don't see most of these songs getting as much response live in concert as their older material, and don't think these will stand the test of time.\n", "val": 0.007522818632423878}
{"text": "If you imagine an intersection where the traditions of country and bluegrass meet the inventions of newgrass and the changes that swept through British contemporary folk, you'll have a sense of the music spun by the Greencards. Their songs feature the tight harmonies of country and bluegrass, the sophistication of jazz, and the pluck of folk. As on 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fascination/dp/B001UJIMSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fascination</a>, the band traverses numerous styles from song to song, but unlike the contrasting colors of their previous outing, here they explore varying shades of their progressive string-band sound. The opening \"Make it Out West,\" though sung about modern contemporary emigration to the coast, still manages to conjure pickaxes and transcontinental rails with its rhythm. Similar  changes are also heard in the jig \"Adelaide,\" while the album's second instrumental, \"Tale of Kangario,\" hints at South American styles.Vocalist Carol Young moves fluidly from country to jazz to pop, occasionally transitioning within a single song. The bass and plucked mandolin of \"Mrs. Madness\" provides a `30s supper club setting for the verses, slides into contemporary harmonies on the chorus and adds modernly picked fills. The longing of \"Faded\" and harmony blend of \"Naked on the River\" lean more toward pop harmony groups like the Rescues than to traditional bluegrass or country, but the mandolin (courtesy of guest Sam Bush), fiddle (from recent addition Tyler Andal) and guitar (from the band's other recent addition, Carl Miner) keep the song anchored to the group's roots. Vince Gill adds a duet vocal on \"Heart Fixer,\" and several dozen fans star as financial supporters, with their names emblazoned on the covers.You can imagine several of these songs turning up on an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Grey-s-Anatomy/dp/B000UZ4G8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Grey's Anatomy</a>&nbsp;or another lovingly curated television show's soundtrack. The Greencards have combined their diverse musical interests in a showcase that highlights the ingredients without sounding forced. They sound modern, but still rooted, a group whose acoustic framework is still recognizable to bluegrass, country and string band fans, but one that could also appeal to contemporary pop listeners.

{"text": "I have been a big fan of the \"99\" series of the Stockholm-based X5 Music Group. They have been turning out quality sets of classical music for remarkable prices here on Amazon for some time. Especially their composer-themed sets featuring full-length works have been tremendous bargains, although other themes such as \"Relaxing\", \"Allegros\", \"Darkest\", etc have also been worthwhile.That's why I was surprised to see that this new \"99 Must-Have\" set of classics for $1.99 on Amazon is released by the Los Angeles-based Cobra Entertainment. It looks like someone has decided to give X5 some competition using this tried and true model.These are not performances by the best-known stars of classical music -- although there are some pretty good players such as Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando or the Budapest Festival Orchestra under Ivan Fischer, who was until recently principal conductor for many years at the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington. I think it's fair to say that a lot of these recordings are by respected Eastern European orchestras and performers -- a model that often works both economically and artistically.The benefit for the consumer of having a new supplier in town is that these are generally a different universe of recordings than on the X5 sets, which as buyers of the series know can be repetitive. I haven't gone over every single track, but I looked at many and so far I'm not finding any tracks that feature the same music by the same performers as any of the X5 collections I have purchased.This is clearly a \"best of classical\" type collection, so a lot of this is music you will have heard before, including on the X5 sets, but a lot of it is different and there is a good proportion of short but full-length works (important for me as I don't particularly care for excerpts). And while there are a lot of \"greatest hits\", there is also quite a bit of music that is off the beaten path. I can't say I was too familiar with Jean Baptiste Loeillet or Zdenek Fibich, or had much Henri Wieniawski in my collection.I must say Cobra has done a better job of staying \"on topic\" than X5 has sometimes. You can't always depend on all the tracks of a \"99 Most Relaxing\" set to really be relaxing, for example, and there are plenty of tracks on the \"99 Most Romantic\" collection that would surely kill any hopes for an amorous trist. But this one really does all seem to contain 100% chill out music. Very soothing. I'm thinking of it for my new baby's nursery at bedtime. Or maybe even for myself at bedtime.My biggest criticism is a lack of attention to detail on things like opus or catalog numbers so the listener can tell what is really playing. One example -- there is a pretty nice string orchestra reworking of a Chopin Nocturne, identified only as \"Nocturne in E flat major\" (track 35). Some digging reveals that it's Nocturne No. 2 in E-flat Major, Op. 9. But it would have been nice not to have to dig. A glance at the track listing shows this kind of labeling is the rule rather than the exception.But this is a good deal with good music. Yes, a lot of it is sliced and diced and pre-processed, but it's good and lives up to the promise of the title.The track listing, as always on Amazon, doesn't show you the composers.

{"text": "First, a note...mysteriously the price of this set increased from $1.99 to $4.99.  I purchased it for $1.99 and, even at that, apparently it was originally released for 99 cents.  That issue out of the way, even if the price were to increase ten-fold (from its current price), it would still be a bargain, particularly considering the typical cost of downloading a single song.The music on here is beautiful.  I am not a fan of the cover which, for some reason, equates relaxation (and/or \"chillout\") with the consumption of scotch/whisky/etc.  Furthermore, if one is going to indulge in two, maybe three, fingers of scotch/whisky/etc, it should be consumed neat, not on the rocks.  Kidding aside, and cover aside, the music itself is gorgeous.  And, as T. Fisher has already touched on, Cobra has succeeded in keeping the theme constant with these recordings.  Sometimes, even with so-called \"relaxing\" compilations, one finds that one selection is relaxing, with the next a little less so, with the next not relaxing in the least, then back to a truly relaxing piece.  Not so here; uniformity and consistency have been achieved, with a stunning result.Definitely a great compilation and well worth even its current price.Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.02457825280725956}

{"text": "This set of (mostly) excerpts from Mozart compositions features quality recordings of good performances, and is a good choice for anyone who wants an in-depth introduction to Mozart, or just a nice playlist of mostly popular Mozart works. On the downside, it is a collection of excerpts, rather than full works. But of course many people are fine with that, and may actually prefer a \"best of\"-type collection.An obvious question for many will be how this collection from LA-based Cobra Entertainment compares to the earlier set&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-99-Most-Essential-Mozart-Masterpieces/dp/B001NJUGV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The 99 Most Essential Mozart Masterpieces</a>&nbsp;from Sweden's X5 Music Group. According to my calculations, 33 of the 99 tracks have the same music, although in different performances. These are almost all typical \"greatest hits\" that anyone would recognize.The other 66 tracks are different selections than those X5 made, and are not all will be instantly recognizable to everyone -- but still all great Mozart. I think it's safe to say there are more opera tracks here, including nine selections from \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and 10 from \"The Magic Flute\" (although surprisingly, these do not include the two of the most famous/popular selections -- the aria of the Queen of the Night or \"Papageno, Papagena\").I am on the record in a lot of reviews as somewhat critical when sets like these, focused on a single composer, present only excerpts from larger works. This is why the set rates four stars in my book, but if you prefer this kind of selection, it could be easily five stars for you.A note for those concerned about repetition. There were four Mozart tracks on the recent bargain collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/99-Must-Have-Chillout-Classics/dp/B0051QU0M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">99 Must-Have Chillout Classics</a>, and all of these are repeated in this set. Some repetition is normal -- content providers by their nature live on repackaging content to some extent. Four tracks isn't much, but caution may be warranted in the future as Cobra Entertainment's catalog grows.I haven't listened to every track, but have listened to many and sampled most by now. The performances are good and the technical quality is very good for MP3 -- variable bit rates averaging 201 to 246 kbps with quality underlying recordings. Total download size is 936 MB.This set is a great bargain, especially at the introductory price of two dollars. It is also nice listening in the car. And finally, with the recent birth of our son, I am always on the lookout for good music in the nursery, and I think most of this will be excellent. I think the short selections here may actually more appropriate than full-length works for the short attention span of an infant.Recommended for anyone, except for those with great Mozart collections already.\n", "val": 0.001733912038616836}

{"text": "My one and only reason for giving this such a low rating is that movements-parts or sections-of the same piece are separated instead of running in consecutive tracks. For example, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, the Allegro (part I) is track #1 and the Andante (part II) is track #78.  Similarly, the Horn Concerto #1, K412, the Rondo (Part II) is track # 36 and the Allegro (Part I) is later in track #67.  Sadly, there are still more examples. This makes no sense, and was obviously put together by someone who knows nothing about classical music.I don't mind not having complete performances-sometimes all I really want to listen to is the one movement that is most \"popular\".  But, to stick in another part of the same piece many tracks later is asinine. If I want to listen to my music in a random order, there is a \"button\" on my mp3 player allowing me to do that.Of course if I wanted to, I could put together my own playlist, putting everything in order, but my whole point in purchasing this was to just have something quick and easy to listen to. Unfortunately I did not look close enough to realize this serious flaw until I had already purchased it; I truly regret this purchase as inexpensive as it is.Having said all this, I will acknowledge the performances are excellent and the recording very good.

{"text": "My mother wasn't a gypsy and my father's never picked up a guitar in his life, but like the narrator of this song, I was born and raised in southern California.  Hours and hours of my late-'80s, early-'90s childhood was spent on those notorious SoCal freeways - and no, the rush-hour traffic isn't anywhere near as bad as you've heard.  Actually it's much worse.  I never minded long car rides, however, because my mother had a CD player in the car.  My brother and I took turns picking out what we wanted to hear, and I loved to press my face up against the window and let the music wash over me, carrying me away to a new exhilarating place in my mind where I was so very alive and free.  Sometimes we listened to my mother's contemporary-Christian albums or Disney soundtracks, but she also borrowed frequently from my uncle's collection of rock CDs.  I grew up listening to Journey, Billy Idol, Meat Loaf, Billy Joel . . .My first thought when I started listening to Night Ranger's \"Growin' Up in California\" was that if I didn't know better, I'd think I was listening to a Journey song I'd never heard before.  This is the same kind of achingly powerful rock, almost over-the-top with guitar and percussion and solid male vocals, that you've heard in \"Any Way You Want It\" and \"Don't Stop Believin'.\"  The lyrics are reminiscent of Journey as well - straightforward and upbeat, yet laced with a subtle melancholy that's hard to explain.They just don't make music like this anymore - and whereas some of my favorite music was first released in the past 15 years, a song with this distinctive sound has the power to take me right back to my preteen years, when I first discovered the power of music.  You don't have to be a fan of classic rock to enjoy this passionate track, but if you are, it should be a special delight to hear those nostalgic sounds in a brand-new song.\n", "val": 0.014261296018958092}

I'm pretty critical of music and won't give a 5 star to just anything from the 80's bands. It has to be exceptional. I'd say this new Night Ranger is dang exceptional. Blades and Keagy can really sing. The guitar work is great too. I've always liked Brad Gillis ever since he toured with Ozzy way, way back in 1982 following the tragic loss of Rhodes. What shoes to fill huh?!!!! Anyway, I digressed a bit. This Night Ranger CD is just plain good rock and roll. Not a disappointing song on the album (can we still call it that?). OK...short and sweet...this is worth buying...definitely!!!I bought George Lynch's Kill All Control with this Night Ranger CD. I couldn't peel this CD out to listen to George's new one yet. George deserve's some of my attention so I'll probably be writing a review for his new one in a day or two.We've still got Gillis, Lynch, Wylde, Satch, Hager, DeMartini, Beach and most of the boys still putting out the good stuff.

{"text": "I got this album for my birthday and had only heard bits of it prior to release.  I've been a Night Ranger fan going back to the mid-eighties when I was a kid.  I was a bit dissatisfied with the last few albums and this latest album harbors no dissatisfaction.Chock full of gun blazing guitars, kick-ass vocals, great songs and...I don't know what else to say!  Wait, yes I do:Follow Your Heart and Lay It Down are hard rockers.  Follow Your Heart has explosive guitar work and I find myself listening to this song every day blasting it like there's no tomorrow and singing like a mad man!  Time Of Our Lives is great and has a powerful hook.  No Time To Lose Ya' is a fun song that pumps right along like Bye Bye Baby (Not Tonight).The interchanging vocals between Jack Blades and Kelly Keagy compliment each other and the harmonies are tight.  Keagy, Blades, and Eric Levy lay down a solid wave that the album rides on.  Keagy has been one my top drummers for years and brings it for this album.WARNING: Air guitaring to this album while driving may be hazardous to your health.  Brad Gillis and Joel Hoekstra simply tear it apart on this album.  In a word, the guitar work on this album is s-i-c-k!  I've enjoyed seeing Brad Gillis live - face it, the guy has the energy of an entire army of guitarists live.  I got a chance two years ago to catch a live show when Hoekstra was touring with the band and it was fantastic.  I cannot wait to see these two rocking songs from this album live.The whole album is great and does bring back some of that care free 80s rock feel.  Be warned that some of the songs do not sound like classic Night Ranger.  Follow Your Heart sounds nothing like 80s Night Ranger or any other Night Ranger for that matter.  I feel some risk was taken by the band by experimenting with their sound and it pays off 100%.  There is no need to compare 80s, 90s, or whatever Night Ranger to this album because it stands on its own.Seems like a lot of bands from the 80s and early 90s are putting out music in survival mode with shameless hype that amounts to a lot of songs that wouldn't qualify as c-side fillers, were there such a thing.  Night Ranger has treated us to an A-list album of songs with Growin' Up In California.  There are not too many albums where I can genuinely say that I like every song - this is one of those rare albums.  My one complaint: I was not happy that the CD did not have Coming of Age on it.Night Ranger, thanks for a great kick ass summer album!  Wow.\n", "val": 0.01128609012812376}

Nothing else really measured up to Ms. Tallman's unique skill at combining traditional, known children's music; a beautiful and easy singing voice; a playful and often funny approach; and remarkable ease to hear the CD again and again. Ms. Tallman's songs invite you in...they invite you to sing, to dance and to create family memories of singing and dancing. Ms. Tallman' s Children's Songs avoids being saccarin sweet, cutesie and or overly simplified--the arrangments are smart and unique but completely approachable. So now I own all of Ms. Tallman's music<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Classical-Baby/dp/B000BLM1KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Classical Baby</a>&nbsp;and DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Come-on-Let-s-Go/dp/B00571VY9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Come on, Let's Go !</a>. I play her music with my family and my teaching. And when I want to give a gift (births, birthdays, showers, teachers) that impresses and supports music education and supports a working artist...I give Susie Tallman.\n", "val": 0.017410313710570335}

I only wish she would make more songs with Springsteen.This CD is an amazing road through her career.  I was fortunate to see her last year in San Francisco and her voice is more beautiful and pure than ever.  I hope this inspires her to keep writing and recording new songs.

{"text": "------------------------------------------------------Rosanne Cash\"The Essential Rosanne Cash\"(Sony Legacy, 2011)------------------------------------------------------This expansive 2-CD best-of could help save a lot of shelf space for CD-oriented fans, gathering material from throughout Cash's career.  It kicks off with \"Can I Still Believe In You,\" a lone track from her long-lost 1978 debut, an out-of-print rarity that was released in Europe, but never in the States.  Then come the Rodney Crowell years, where she and he helped sculpt a hip new country sound, melding artful, introspective lyrics with big, hook-heavy production -- just the right mix to take her to the top of the country charts throughout the early '80s.  There are a bunch of missing songs that I, personally, would have added here (especially \"Couldn't Do Nothin' Right\" and \"Take Me Take Me\") but with a collection like this, you can't have everything.  Disc One contains primarily her younger, Crowell-related material, including gems such as the smash hit, \"Seven Year Ache\" and \"My Baby Thinks He's A Train\"; Disc Two encompasses her later, more introspective albums, with standouts that include her tribute to her father, \"September When It Comes,\" and a smattering of songs from the List album.  There are, of course, several duets gathered here as well, including a nice one with Vince Gill and a fun version of Don Gibson's \"Sea Of Heartbreak,\" sung with Bruce Springsteen.  All in all, a great introduction to a thoughtful, potent, spiritually mature artist - definitely worth a spin! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)\n", "val": 0.005367919337004423}

{"text": "For an artist of her stature, Rosanne Cash has been the subject of surprisingly thin compilation releases. Several 10- and 12-track single disc collections have been issued, but only Raven's imported 21-track&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Blue-Moons-and-Broken-Hearts/dp/B0009VI5P2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Blue Moons and Broken Hearts</a>&nbsp;and to a lesser extent Legacy's earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Very-Best-Of/dp/B000BKDNXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Very Best Of</a>&nbsp;really dug beyond the hits. That list is now expanded with this two-disc, thirty-six track collection, featuring a song list picked and programmed by the artist herself. The set opens with \"Can I Still Believe in You,\" from her 1978 self-titled Germany-only debut, and closes over thirty years later with a trio of tracks drawn from 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-List/dp/B0029LHW5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The List</a>. The latter selections include a cover of Mickey Newbury's \"Sweet Memories\" previously available only on the Borders Books version of The List.Included are all eleven of Cash's country chart-toppers, seventeen of her twenty country chart entries, and tracks drawn from all twelve studio albums she's recorded for Ariola, Columbia and Capitol/EMI. There are augumented with bonuses drawn from earlier antholgies, and duets from albums by Vince Gill (\"If It Weren't For Him\") and Rodney Crowell (\"Its Such a Small World\"). The bulk of the collection is devoted to Cash's tenure with Columbia, with the second half of disc two stepping through her more recent work for Capitol/EMI. These latter tracks find Cash reinventing herself from a country hit maker to a writer, album auteur and Grammy nominee. This plays out as a worthy soundtrack for Cash's recent memoir,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Composed/dp/0670021962/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Composed</a>, provides a terrific overview of her hits and a useful guide to the rich album tracks in her catalog.Though Cash isn't prone to complimenting her debut, the strength of her songwriter's voice is evident from the start. It may be difficult at mid-life to fully reconnect with the yet-to-be-fulfilled longing one felt at twenty-three, but the early songs provide telling snapshots of a young writer who was already able to express her soul in words. A year later, on 1979's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Right-or-Wrong/dp/B00005QK4Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Right or Wrong</a>, Cash sounds more confident, singing as an equal with Bobby Bare on \"No Memories Hangin' Round,\" and producer Rodney Crowell deftly blended roots with radio-friendly touches. Her follow-up,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Seven-Year-Ache/dp/B00005QK4Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Seven Year Ache</a>, broke her career wide open with an album and title track that each topped the country chart; the single also crossed over, stopping just shy of the pop top twenty.Cash's songs and vocals, and Crowell's production fit easily across a variety of styles, including pop ballads, twangy roots, countrypolitan jazz, and horn-lined soul. Several of the hits, particularly those in the mid-80s, tended to crystalline guitars, big piano and booming drums, but Cash also topped the chart with the locomotive rhythm of \"My Baby Thinks He's a Train,\" the Brill Building soul of John Hiatt's \"The Way We Make a Broken Heart,\" and most endearingly, an acoustic shuffle of \"Tennessee Flat Top Box\" that recalled her dad's early days at Sun.Cash's introductory notes provide a peek inside the discoveries that occur when an artist anthologizes her own catalog - thinking back to the places and people that influenced one's work, and wondering who they were when a particular song was written or performed. It's hard to tell if the songs provide mileage markers for her life, or her life provides the events that demarcate the phases of her career; a bit of each, it seems. The set's affectionate and perceptive liner notes are written by Rodney Crowell, to whom Cash was married and who produced her first five albums. The booklet adds detailed session notes, including chart information and personnel, and fleshes out this terrific overview of a second-generation country legend.

{"text": "As Rosanne Cash related in her recent memoir, 'Composed', her life has been filled with many highs and lows, and Rosanne is a glass half-full kind of girl.  From the first track of 'Can I Still Believe In You' to the last track 'Sweet Memories', Rosanne brings us her history. Rosanne comes from a family rich in music from the old folk tunes, cultural and regional tunes, jazz, pop, rock and blues and country. Rosanne Cash is not a one note woman, her lucious voice crosses many genres. Her father, Johnny Cash, gave her a list of songs that she cherishes. It is filled with the tunes that describe our Americana. Rosanne has given us a cross section of some of those tunes, and the songs that she has sung in her albums over the past thirty plus years. Her life is interwoven through out these songs.Rosanne sings with her father, Johnny Cash, Bobby Bare, Vince Gill, Rodney Crowell, Bruce Springsteen and Chris Thile. Many of my favorites are on this 36 song, two disc marvel. In this 'Essential' CD Rosanne brings us from her early beginnings, 'It Hasn't Happened Yet', to the sad times with one of the most emotional songs, 'September When It Comes' with Johnny Cash, to her record seller, 'Seven Year Ache'. It is difficult to pick a favorite, but 'Sea of Heartbreak' sung with Bruce Springsteen is it for me. You will find many songs that speak to you in this set, and we will all find our favorite voice.Rosanne Cash brings us her life on a platter of 36 songs. All of them real and all of them a part of her life that brings us the whole truth. This is a comprehensive history of the singing life of Rosanne Cash. As she says in her song 'The Real Me',\"Well, I've got no answers now And I don't expect them from you Thank God for second chances, baby 'Coz there's something I can give to youAnd that's the real me, breakin' down at last Hey, it's the real me, crawlin' out of my past Baby, the real me, wants the real you, so bad\"Happy Birthday, Rosanne Cash!Highly Recommended.  prisrob 05-24-11<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-List/dp/B0029LHW5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The List</a><a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Very-Best-of/dp/B000BKDNXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Very Best of</a>\n", "val": 0.009568775072693825}

{"text": "Presented in more or less chronological order, the first CD is filled with hits while the second CD covers Rosanne's career since the hits dried up. There is, of course, no drop in the quality of Rosanne's music on the second CD, which has always been at a high level. That said, I slightly prefer the hits CD overall, partly because of the greater familiarity of the songs but also because it seems to have more variation in pace and tempo.The first CD omit's a couple of top 30 country hits from 1980 (Couldn't do nothing right, Take me take me) and a couple of top 5 country hits from the mid-eighties (Ain't no money, Second to no one) but it includes two early non-hits (Can I still believe in you?, Baby better start turnin' em down) together with her top ten country hit duet with Vince Gill (If it weren't for him) and her number one country hit duet with her former husband Rodney Crowell (It's such a small world). All of Rosanne's ten solo number country hits are also featured including Tennessee flat top box (a cover of one of her father's country hits) and I don't want to spoil the party (the first and so far only cover of a Beatles song to top the country chart  Rosanne wrote or co-wrote some of her own material including four of her number one hits (Seven year ache, Blue moon with heartache, I don't know why you don't want me, If you change your mind), so she certainly didn't depend on outside writers.The second CD contains several tracks that were released as singles, to of which (On the surface, What we really want) became minor country hits while the others failed to chart at all. Not that it mattered, because Rosanne had established her career and was able to continue earning a living via tours and album sales, and she preferred to do things her way. Rosanne wrote most of the songs on this CD, with three of the five tracks that she didn't write coming from her excellent covers album The list. Among the original songs on this CD, highlights include her introspective The real me and the emotional September when it comes, a duet with her father.This 36-track double CD provides an excellent introduction to Rosanne's music for anybody who hasn't got any of it, but is also great for anybody who (like me) has some of her music already. If you only want a hits collection and aren't interested in what came later, you could opt to buy one of the single CD compilations, but even though I slightly prefer the hits, Rosanne's later music is well worth hearing.\n", "val": 0.010741455480456352}
{"text": "No one expects Shania to have the same popularity she had in the 90s, but people expect her to produce mature, quality work. Sadly, this song is not hitting that mark. Shania went for a big pop sound, but radio from all genres are ignoring it because the song is only average. Shania really should return to her country roots and use less production on her songs. Her voice is better when the music is stripped down and simple. She also need to put more depth in her lyrics. I know pre-teens that write better than this.My advice to Shania: write deeper lyrics, less production on your music, rediscover your twang, make your voice the focal point, and be more daring.\n", "val": 7.560772792203352e-05}
{"text": "Shania's latest single is definitely not her best single ever.  In fact, it doesn't come close to \"You're Still the One,\" \"Forever & For Always,\", or \"Any Man of Mine.\"That being said, I really like this song and its message.  The melody is very simple, which is both good and bad.  It's easy to sing along with, and the words are inspiring, but it's such a departure from her earlier work, that it took me a few listens before I liked the song.As a Shania fan, it is good to hear from her again, and she still sings with that same raw emotion.  I just hope that her album includes some powerhouse hits like \"That Don't Impress Me Much\" or \"From This Moment On.\"  She's very talented, and this song doesn't quite showcase all of that, but then again, she can take her time and ease back into the industry.\"Today is Your Day\" proves that Shania still has her same beautiful voice, and although the song itself is overly-simplistic, it is catchy and give fans something while she completes prep-work on her next studio album.\n", "val": 0.007779251784086227}
{"text": "It has been a long time since we have heard new material from Shania and I personally think it is a good start to relaunching her career.  She has worked through emotional and physical problems and faced daunting situations (including going it alone without ex-husband and producer Lange).  \"Today is Your Day\" is an inspirational song to listeners who have faced personal turmoil and have been faced with difficult times in their lives.  It is her first 'solo' song - since her debut album, Shania Twain - and it may not be her biggest/most popular release, but it's a hell of a good start.  This song sets her up for a good comeback.\n", "val": 0.03440281003713608}

While it is honestly wonderful hearing her sing again after such a unamicable betrayal, it sadly doesn't feel like it is as driven as her earlier work, it still is a fresh start for Shania.

If you play some Luther Vandross, Freddie Jackson, AL Green or Anita Baker then you've got my attention, but once in a while some new artist will catch my ear (Anthony Hamilton). Ms Ledisi has without a doubt caught my attention and if this song is an indication of the talent this young woman possess then I must delve deeper into her musical Library. Though she doesn't command the vocal power and sensuality of a my all time favorite female artist Anita Baker (but then again who really does) she has a beautiful old school vibe of her own. I long for the days when R&B music had heart and soul poured into every note and every verse and this young woman is most definitely headed in the right direction. Unfortunately because she has real talent she won't become mainstream and many people will pass her over in favor of a Beyonc or the like.

{"text": "Keating's warm compositions have been adopted for ballet, as they have drive and narrative. This album is noble in spirit, determined in mood, rhythmic in effect, reduced in lyricism, and each track similar in tone. Its pleasant, enveloping sound is enjoyable; yet the album is much like consuming a sensual, delicious meal but soon hungry and unquenced. With her electronic mixing that creates multiple cellos in harmony and counterpoint, we hear sonorous sound and strong beats. Track 1 is a short prologue, a tuning up and matching of bands. In two parts, the following piece has a driving tempo, then a relaxed excursion. Her happy composition, Optimist, repeated live at the end of the album, is a playful dance with underlying heart beat. The Path is is marked by a repeated descending four-note phrase against an eight-beat pulse in a persistent march. Lost begins as a melancholy lament suggestive of a Renaissance choral piece but returns to the pulse of the previous track. With her soft whistling into the cellos openings, Keating suggests evening crickets or frogs and quiet rustlings followed by a pastiche of melodies. A confident andante follows with finger drumming on the cello. The next track has a rapid four-beat pulsing akin to the earlier Path, for both titles suggest direction and movement. The Last Bird is focused on the treble range, with Philip Glass-like rhythmic arpeggios in the background; the feeling is a lament. The last studio piece is a series of crescendos and intermittent riffs indicating avian swooping and play. Keating thus provides a poetic adventure of travel and reward.\n", "val": 0.01486229058355093}

{"text": "It's not often that someone will come along with the vision to see a new way of applying their instrument, the ambition to bring it to reality, and the hardcore classical chops to get it right.  Keating manages all three, and the result is a wonderful piece of work, as amenable to playing as background music as it is to attentive listening.  It's also a better album than \"Natoma\" IMO -- \"Natoma\" sounded to me as if Keating were sort of frobbing the dials on this new way of recording and expressing herself, still working out the kinks and learning how to get her ideas down in this new way.  \"Trees\" is where this whole means of writing and recording has reached its first stage of maturity, a fully realized album filled with beautiful music and wonderfully articulated ideas.Her way of approaching her instrument has given every instrument, no matter how sidelighted in the past, an opportunity to carry a full and complete performance.  With this approach, the bassoon, the viola, the bass trombone, and every other instrument that's been relegated to accompaniment throughout history now has the tonal and expressive spread of a piano or even a complete orchestra.  Come on bassoonists, let's hear what you can do!If you're curious about Keating -- and nowdays who isn't? -- get \"Trees\" first.  If you then find yourself curious about her method -- and again, who wouldn't be? -- get \"Natoma\" to see how her creative process came into being and evolved.

This makes one person sound like an orchestra, and creates dense and layered tracks that is reminiscent of electronica music like trance.  Some of it is almost meditative in quality like gregorian chant.  You need a system with a good bass capability to really appreciate her work.  Some of her pieces resonate in very low frequencies and is stunning with a good sub.  I have both this album and 'One Cello X 16:Natoma.'

{"text": "My impression of Zeit is that the band members of Tangerine Dream were aiming to try and out-do the dark, nightmarish psychedelic period of Pink Floyd (such as what we experienced from albums like A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle and even the studio portion of Ummagumma for that matter).  I think it actually works.  This is some EXTREMELY moving stuff.Unlike Pink Floyd however, there's no actual songwriting to speak of.  Just waves upon waves and layers upon layers of incredibly spooky soundtrack/ambient sounds that will definitely take your mind through a variety of the creepiest settings and places in the entire universe.  Seriously, this stuff is so whacked out that your imagination won't stop at just planet Earth.  This journey takes us to Neptune and beyond!Interesting side note- the more you hear this stuff, the more it absorbs into your mind.  The ambient sounds actually manage to come together to create lengthy masterpieces.  I can't explain HOW it works, but it does.  Give it a chance.  Definitely the kind of album you need to hear several times in order to fully and properly digest.My favorite song by FAR is the opener titled \"Birth of Liquid Plejades\".  The first 7 minutes sounds like nothing but the DARKEST violin (or cello) solo in the history of mankind.  It sounds like it's just repeatedly playing one or two ominous notes over and over, totally reminiscent of the soundtrack from the relatively popular film There Will Be Blood.  After that portion of the song is over, these organs come into the picture and they're noticeably creepy as well.  The synths are remarkably melodic, if I recall.  That carries us through most of the song.Let me describe \"Birth of Liquid Plejades\" even more.  The cellos actually remind me of this forest area that takes about 10 minutes to walk there from my house.  This area is right when the Amish fields stop and the woods appear.  It's pretty darn creepy, especially 20 minutes after the sun sets on a calm October night.  The woods sort of go around in a circle, and when the conditions are right I feel like I'm being haunted by something.  I've also seen some strange things back there such as weird bugs and animals I couldn't recognize coming out of the woods and looking at me.  I've also had pets buried back there.  This song makes me think about that particular area and really elevates the feeling of creepiness.Now after those 7 minutes of cellos conclude, the song seems to take another ghostly turn- this time making me think about ghost ships that have disappeared into the fog and were never seen again.  This section of the song really captures the feeling of mystery concerning the ships and even includes these occasional ghostly hawls to really elevate the atmosphere.  These ghostly sounds always appear at JUST the right time.  I love it.  The song then finishes up with some organs to make it seem like everything we've just experienced is related to heaven in some way.  Just a wonderful song overall and one that's totally unlike anything else.\"Nebulous Dawn\" is mostly made up of, again, distinctly creepy nightmare world settings using some of the most frightening ambient sounds in existence (or rather, the most frightening ambient sounds technologically available at the time).  Alright, these tricks were probably used in several horror or science fiction films back in the day, but nobody ever released an entire albums worth of similar effects, have they?  If they have, it surely wasn't 70 minutes long and probably wasn't NEARLY as terrifying as the ambient tricks presented here.This is where Tangerine Dream deserves credit for Zeit- it's a daring experiment, and I say \"daring\" because there was a good chance this kind of stuff would have been immediately rejected by the general public back in the day had Tangerine Dream been as popular as Pink Floyd, and you know, perhaps it was rejected in some areas of the world.  I don't believe Tangerine Dream was popular enough for any rejection to be taken into consideration though (at least, not in America in the early 70's).Anyway \"Nebulous Dawn\" feels like what would happen if bright lights were to shine through my bedroom window one night, and I was then forced to walk outside across a wheat field, through some thick weeds and eventually to these caves where aliens were planning to abduct me.  Incredibly atmospheric.The weak point is probably \"Origin of Supernatural Probabilities\".  By \"weak\" I of course mean \"Extremely cool but the worst song here\".  The ambience is pretty good but there's a few moments when the atmosphere does nothing remotely interesting.  However when it *is* interesting (such as the first half with the clever use of ghostly shrills and other effects involving these tricks that continuously fade in and out when you pay extremely close attention to the piece- it's effectively breathtaking to say the least) you will be blown away completely.  Some of the ambient sounds remind me of a laboratory of sorts where viral experiments take place, and where bodies are stored or frozen for future studies.  Even a zombie setting wouldn't be out of the question.  Awesome.Oh, and the title song.  PLEASE, listen to the first few minutes and tell me THAT doesn't remind you of an atmospheric world in a Metroid game (\"Metroid\" is a video game series in case you aren't familiar with the name).  The rest of the song has quietly performed ominous waves of unusual ambient sounds with a dangerously thick and intense atmosphere.  I admire it quite a bit.Zeit may just be the craziest, creepiest, oddest, strangest, darkest soundtrack I've ever heard.  That is, if you were to call it a soundtrack.  It probably doesn't qualify as such, but it sure *sounds* like one.\n", "val": 0.013539498671889305}

{"text": "The VCS3 was a small but highly programmable synthesizer in the early 70's and allowed you to make a wide range of strange if not particularly musical sounds. It was easy to make beeps, rumbling drones, bees buzzing, strange bells, unearthly trills, grinding rhythmic noises and a very convincing water splashing sound. It was not so easy to make popular music with it but that was clearly not Tangerine Dream's intention with this album.The first side \"Birth of Liquid Plejades\" stands out as being mostly musical. It begins with what sounds like cellos unable to stay in tune. Every note that implies a melody is quickly cut off with a conflicting note. The second section is mostly Florian Fricke playing a single long note on his Moog briefly interrupted by other quick notes causing an echo effect (this trick is used a few too many times) while Froese slowly grinds notes on a highly processed guitar. The piece ends with ex-member Steve Schroyder playing organ chords but not in any order that implies a musical progression. In fact the cut just suddenly ends mid-chord. Maybe that's when Schroyder was fired.The last three sides of Zeit sounds like a Tangerine Dream notebook of the most interesting sounds they were able to coax out of their new VCS3s, organs and Froese's guitar effects. There are attempts to bookend the songs with a theme. \"Nebulous Dawn\" starts with a \"braaaap\" sound announcing its beginning along with some nice vibraphone but falls into waves of dissonant electronic sounds (sounds like the VCS3 ring modulator) with little structure. \"Origin of Supernatural Probabilities\" begins with a mournful melody and a spooky breathing sound in the background which fades into Froese playing similar mournful chords through a barely recognizable guitar. After this promising beginning, the track becomes another showcase of VCS3 drones and random organ sounds. The title track starts with an ominous drone and Froese sliding chords into deep echos. The tuneless drone expands, contracts, moves around, and slowly changes through the piece giving the track a uniform if intentionally monotonous sound. The rest is mostly Froese sliding dissonant chords and notes on his guitar through countless echo units and reverb. It ends with a few vibraphone notes that almost sound pretty before suddenly ending.What makes Zeit timeless is that despite all the electronic noise, it doesn't sound very dated. It sounds nothing like the simple clichd bleeps and bwops that has makes much of the electronic music of the 70's hard to listen to now. Tangerine Dream somehow managed to avoid falling into these traps by selecting the most complicated and interesting sounds and carefully mixing them with appropriate amounts of echo and reverb to disguise their origins and not even attempting to pass it off as music. At first the pieces sound unstructured but repeated listenings show that a remarkable amount of effort was made to select and mix sounds together and organize them in some way that sounds interesting although it's impossible to say why.After listening to it for another month, perhaps I should give Tangerine Dream more credit for having the guts to create a double album that completely defies all conventions of song structure. Except for some bookends there is no real melody. Except for Schroyder's organ in one song there is no real rhythm. Still, this wasn't a lazy collection of random electronic noises. Maybe it was the equivalent of giving conventional rock music the middle finger.I can imagine Klaus Schulze recording the similar Irrlicht by himself but I can't imagine how three band members came to decisions about how each piece on Zeit should go. They must have had pages of notes to keep track of the VCS3 programming since there is little repetition. Did they start with one improvised layer and add subsequent layers of noise? Did they argue over which buzzing drone sounded more appropriate or that one sound wasn't loud enough in the mix? How three people could make an album like this is almost as mysterious as the sound itself.There are a number of recordings at the Free Music Archive like Ambient Fabric, Noise Research, Phopha, Subterrestrial that feature droning electronic sounds and puzzling indecipherable audio clips into a form similar to Zeit and they're free. Any similarities to music are purely accidental.\n", "val": 0.00013448823301587254}

{"text": "In 1974, the release of Tangerine Dream's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Phaedra/dp/B0000074C9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Phaedra</a>&nbsp;captivated Canadian youth and was to hold them in thrall for three further albums.

Krautrock had come to Canada and changed popular music forever.On the merit of Phaedra, I quickly discovered the first four albums on Ohr (mach das Ohr auf) Records, which were deeper and more rewarding than the rather commercial Phaedra. Of these, Zeit, the album that sums up Tangerine Dream the best, sounds as visionary and mysterious today as it did then. If you are looking for the one TD album to fill that gap in your collection, this is the one to buy. It has both LPs on one disk and, as a bonus, is accompanied by a fine 78-minute live performance from the same year on a second disk. Weit drauen, Mann!\n", "val": 0.008741606958210468}
{"text": "The Origin of Ambient?Appearing in 1972, this album may be the beginning of the genre. It is Sound, not Music. To say it takes your mind out into the far reaches of the galaxy would not be farfetched. More probable than improbable. What does the galaxy sound like? Static? If humans can imagine the sound this may be what they hear.\"Time\". The album's title is a good description of what you will hear. Slowly making its way along smoothly through its hour and fourteen minute duration, there seems to be no beginning and no end. It just seems to start and stop. Always droning but never boring, this is an album meant to played from start to finish.`Birth Of Liquid Plejades' starts it off with a dominating drone. After a while this turns into a more peaceful drone. After more time it builds into something along the lines of gothic prayer.Where the first track placed us in orbit, `Nebulous Dawn' leads us out into deep space. The sounds of alien lighthouses, what 20th century humans called pulsars, can clearly be heard. If one listens closely they will also hear the interstellar traffic that these alien beacons are guiding. Space is a busy place when it comes to trading interplanetary goods.The droning and pulsations of `Origin Of Supernatural Probabilities' could be the sound you hear while being in the presence of The Maker, or some other worldly hive of constant creators.With `Zeit' we seem to reach our destination, a truly alien planet. It has parts in it that are reminiscent of 1950's science fiction movies. Electric running water and perturbed parakeets surrounded by a weird hollow vibe can be found here. Echoes of unusual sounds come at you and if you ask me, the high registers in this recording are distorted. And after all this time, it suddenly ends. It is just over. Sorry guys, ran out of tape.It is hard not to give this album 5 stars, as it sets itself so far apart from the norm. The thought that anyone would buy it let alone listen to the whole thing makes it quite a gamble to manufacture and put on the market. The record company was as much a futuristic thinker as was the band.  \"Zeit\" was a trend setter ahead of its time, a time that still seems to be far in the future.\n", "val": 0.0001123361216741614}
{"text": "So this is Tangerine Dream's third album from 1971, back in their early days when they were more droning than melodic (ie., it's nothing like Tangram). You won't find the repeating arpeggio-like sequences on this one that you find on Phaedra from a couple of albums later either. In fact parts of this album remind me a lot of Rubycon, but this one is darker and more haunting and less rhythmic (still has rhythm though), has a kind of sci-fi/horror soundtrack feel to it. I really enjoy listening to the beats - by which I mean the way the frequencies of the different synth sounds interact with each other so that they constructively interfere.This album is ace and I enjoyed it because of how moody it is. All the tracks have their own character to them so it doesn't get too monotonous. Probably my second favourite TD album I've heard so far (which includes Electronic Meditation, Phaedra, Ricochet, Stratosfear, Force Majeure, Tangram and Exit).\n", "val": 0.01531997974961996}
{"text": "There are four different main CD versions of this release. The first release in the 80s on Jive, along with a couple others in different countries, the first remastered 1996 version, the 2000 era Castle release with just the album and brickwalled sound on 3 tracks, and the newer Esoteric release with full dynamic range and a second disc of extras.Sound Quality is all up to your ears. The original which is a little crusty, although some people seem to like its sound from the old 80s ADC convertors, the 90s version which sounds fine, the early 2000 version which sounds fine but has a quite low DR on some tracks, and the two disc Esoteric to my ears sounds great and a bit more lively on the top end.Altogether I think the new Esoteric releases are mandatory for TD fans because of the stellar packaging. Some have said there is a bit of noise reduction, but I am not really hearing it to any harsh degree. New analog to digital convertors I am sure pick up tons of noise, and at any rate the sound is fantastic to my ears.I honestly cannot hear all that much difference on any of the remasters. I find the EQ just fine for the most part. The album still has a lot of noise on this 2011 release. One poster on Hoffman forums, who I find in every thread about Esoteric TD remasters, seems to think falsely that they have worse dynamic range. This is the opposite case for Zeit. All tracks actually have the full dynamic range here. I don't hear but a pinch of noise reduction and quite honestly these records need a bit of it.The cover art for the Castle Remaster and 2CD Esoteric are slightly different in color and tone. Overall, I find the Esoteric release to be totally satisfying. These old TD records can have too much hiss if you ask me, and they are still plenty noisy even with this new remaster. I for one am listening on quality hardware, and I find it hard to distinguish between the two at times.You really don't need to know much about this one for the actual content. It is one of TD's utter masterpieces. Innovative and enthralling to the end. \"Birth of Liquid Plejades\" may be the single greatest ambient/electronic track in history. Eerie and so encompassing in high-end headphones. Smoke up for this one and turn the lights off. There is nothing else quite like it.The rest of the CD is highly experimental and still of very high quality. The extra disc on the Esoteric presents two long alternate tracks from the era and a different spin on TD's abilities. Well worth the price for the stellar extras on this one. Zeit is well worth your money.\n", "val": 0.006584537215530872}
{"text": "Perhaps no other album better defines the aims and techniques of kosmische musik than Zeit. As Julian Cope explains in his Krautrocksampler, \"...its remarkable unchanging unfolding near-static barely-shifting vegetable organic-ness takes over the room and permeates the whole house...the room in which Zeit is playing becomes that room.\" To say that Zeit is otherworldly is understating the matter considerably. These are the sounds the stars make as they exhaust their nuclear fuel and collapse inward through the fabric of space itself to some inscrutable fate. These are sonic portraits of yawning alien vistas, hymns to the staggering distances between the island galaxies. Zeit evokes ancient memories of our extraterrestrial origins, visions that are at once immense, incomprehensible, profound, amorphous and utterly cosmic. The sustained cello note that slowly emerges out of the silence at the beginning of \"Birth of Liquid Plejades\" resonates like some fearful cord of memory being struck at the base of one's brain, dredging up dim shadows of mystical transfigurations from the inorganic to the sentient, from nonexistence to being. Like an iceberg slowly forming, the piece adds layer upon layer of sound, eventually drifting into an interlude of stasis and calm supported by Edgar Froese's plaintive organ and the aqueous flow of guest Florian Fricke's modular Moog. \"Nebulous Dawn\" ushers in Eno's ambient music program a decade ahead of schedule. Rising out of a primordial drone, the piece quickly turns into a lysergic nightmare, visualized in sound and transmitted on the radio waves of the subconscious mind. Its detuned bell tones klang ominously atop a background of carefully mixed and modulated electronic sounds, ranging from high-pitched shrieks and sub-harmonnic rumblings to disembodied moans and the spectral effluvia of ectoplasmic generators. Both \"Origin of Supernatural Probabilities\" and \"Zeit\" are similar in design, though more minimalist in execution. Quiet and introspective, both of these tracks utilize primarily the same sound sources from \"Birth of Liquid Plejades\" and \"Nebulous Dawn,\" yet achieve a more muted, autumnal effect. \"Origin...\" and \"Zeit\" take on the character of phantom landscapes lost somewhere on the border between consciousness and unconsciousness. Listen to Zeit one evening when you're taking a dip in the isolation tank, and you may never find your way back to reality.\n", "val": 0.002087873173877597}
{"text": "I've eagerly snapped up most of the entries in the \"99 Most Essential\" classical series, and I've been hoping they'd come up with an \"Adagios\" compilation. My hopes were answered when I downloaded this compilation -- it's a crowd-pleasing selection of pieces, performed well and in some cases brilliantly. All the favorites are here, and the compilation starts off with three of the best-loved adagios: Albinoni's Adagio in G Minor for Strings and Organ, Bach's Suite for Orchestra No. 3 in D Major, and Barber's Adagio for Strings, Op. 11a. The selections are not just a dumbed-down \"best-of,\" though. They're not just background music; it's clear that a lot of thought went into the choices. For example, I was pleasantly surprised to find Henryk Grecki's highly emotional \"Symphony of Sorrowful Songs\" represented, and sung beautifully by Teresa Erbe.There is some overlap with other entries in the \"99 Most Essential\" series, notably \"The 99 Most Essential Baroque Masterpieces\" and \"The 99 Most Essential Relaxing Classics.\" This doesn't bother me, personally, because these albums are so fabulously inexpensive they average out at pennies per track, so I don't mind repurchasing a few tracks. More to the point, I'm delighted to have a broad selection of adagios all together in one compilation, flowing together to create a long, uninterrupted expanse of calm. When I need to hunker down for a long stretch to write something complicated and technical, this type of music is invaluable. It stills the chatter in my mind and evens out my emotional state so I can focus on the difficult task at hand. I draw as a hobby, and I have long found that adagios help me unwind and get into a contemplative state when I'm ready to do a little drawing at the end of the day. I believe their calm, stately quality has a positive effect on my art.I'm glad the \"99 Most Essential\" people have finally created a collection of adagios. This set will be getting a lot of play any time I need to focus, relax, and channel my energies into creativity.\n", "val": 0.015916120260953903}
{"text": "This set may be very worthwhile for those who have not been buying other sets in the \"99 Most Whatever\" series of the X5 music group, and especially for those who don't listen to a lot of classical music. The recordings they present are almost always in high quality, and the music is nearly always well selected and a real pleasure to listen to.But I've bought many of these sets in the past, and for those watching the series, there is little going on here. Compared to my music library -- which contains most, but not all of the previous 99 sets -- this collection contains 62 tracks out of 99 that are outright repeats. Same music, same performance. I think that number will be higher for people who own the 99 Most Essential Debussy and 99 Most Essential Cello sets, neither of which I have purchased so far.A further 17 tracks are music that has been featured in previous sets in different performance. There are 20 tracks of music \"new\" to the series, but these are mostly excerpts from standard repertory pieces that a lot of people have heard.I am counting about 12-13 full-length shorter works in this set -- the rest are bits and bobs, stray snippets and movements cut out of longer works.For me, this set would have come down to three new short, complete works: a Chopin Nocturne (track 48), Bruch's Ave Maria for Cello and Orchestra (track 50) and Bruch's Adagio on Celtic Themes (track 92). Now, that may well be worth $1.99 right there, but I'll pass anyway.For those who may be interested, I'm including a track list with composers below, which I prepared for myself when I was considering whether to buy or not.Again, if you're new to these sets and especially if you're new to classical, this is warmly recommended at the bargain Daily Deal price on June 12, 2011.

I've listened to it about 50 times in the last few weeks, and I am still listening to it. Brittney's pure and powerful vocals are a perfect match for the giant blast of sound that accompanies her. Their melodies are lovely, and I Iove the non-stop ferocious power of their music. And Scott Buchanan on the drums is very good, even though he is a computer programmer by trade.As far as each song goes, Dawn of the Ages is an excellent opening track.

I bought a Bryston Amp and some $2K speakers recently and started dusting off old CD's and went straight to Mandy.  I said to self 'self, you need to check because surely she has some new CD's in the past 10 years'.  So I cam here to Amazon.  I was glad to see a couple of new ones, but disappointed that there weren't more.  But you know how it is, you get a quality singer and they don't make it to the top because they are too good!  Anyway, I ordered her Christmas CD (which I haven't received yet), and the 'Always' CD plus this one.  I got this one a couple days ago and if it was vinyl it would be getting worn out by now!  I LOVE IT!  My only disappointment is that I'm too old for her, and my super handsome son is too young! LOL!  THIS IS QUALITY MUSIC AT ITS BEST!  Diana Krall needs to watch out!  My only very small criticism is that Mandy's voice is best soft and low, and when she goes up and hits higher notes, the engineer got it a little too loud.  My favorite on this CD is Faded Love!

{"text": "Prime Cuts: Have You Ever Been Lonely; Faded Love, She's Got YouLife after death has been more integral and more glamorous for Patsy Cline.  Way before Shania Twain or Taylor Swift, Cline trail blazed into the penthouse of both the pop and country genre.  Championing the cause that women can just be as successful as men in all genres of music, Cline did become a mover and shaker with hits such as \"Walking After Midnight,\" \"Crazy\" and \"She's Got You.\"  Unfortunately, the span of time where Cline was commanding the charts was curtailed by her sudden tragic death.  In fact, her years of commercial success only lasted for the last couple of years of her life.  In an interesting turn of fate, it was her posthumous albums that truly established her as an icon in country music when her MCA Records \"12 Greatest Hits\" disc became one of the biggest sellers of all time.  As a result, many artists have gone through the extra mile to re-capture the ageless ingenuity of Cline. Canadian pop-country chanteuse k .d. lang even tried to re-create the Patsy Cline magic by recording with Cline's producer Owen Bradley for her debut CD.  More blatant that lang, Mandy Barnett has impersonated her heroine in the musical \"Always... Patsy Cline\" when she was a mere teenager.  15 years later,  years, Barnett is back reprising her role and as a bonus she has recorded an album's worth of Cline covers here \"Sweet Dreams.\"After all these years of living and breathing the life of Patsy Cline on stage each night, how does Barnett fare on \"Sweet Dreams\"?  Safe to say, Barnett has captured vocal nuances of Cline to perfection.  Barnett, just like Cline, knows when to hold on to a note and when just to break in order to bring out the teary effect of the song's lyrics.  Case in point is Barnett's take of \"She's Got You.\"  Listen especially to how Barnett teases us with her gorgeous vocals as she drives us through the heartbreaking ride of being jilted by her lover.  Keeping in step with the original where a lushful string section gives comfort to a broken hearted Barnett as she daydreams of a love gone bad in the breakup ballad \"So Wrong.\"  Perhaps one of the saddest entry Cline ever recorded just before her death is the devastating bitter \"Faded Love.\"  When Barnett sings \"as I read all the letters you wrote to me...\" you can almost taste her teardrops; nowadays such heartbreaking gems are almost non-existent.But Barnett is more than a fulsome copycat.  She does inject her persona and delightful interpretations to her takes.  Stepping away from the more crowded rendition of the original, Barnett on the Willie Nelson-composed \"Crazy\" offers a starker and more jazzy rendition.  Barnett is further to be congratulated for tackling the lesser known Cline tracks.  This includes the somehow obscure \"Bill Bailey, Please Come Back Home\" wre Barnett's version sounds more at home at the Cabaret Hall than the Opry. On \"Have You Ever Been Lonely\" Barnett kicks up her heels giving this honky tonk number an infectious romp. Though Cline has recorded the Irving Berlin's \"Always\" before, it is not often associated with the icon.  Thus, it is refreshing that Barnett has not restricted to the standard Cline repertoire.  Barnett's version of \"Always\" is effortlessly sweet and rejuvenating to listen to.Nevertheless, when most of Cline's recordings are mostly still readily been re-issued, \"Sweet Dreams\" in some ways is an indulgent.  On tracks such as \"Walking After Midnight\" and \"I Fall to Pieces,\" Barnett plays it far too safely. They are far too Cline-ish.  It would have worked even better if Barnett had been more adventurous.  And after all these years between albums, it would be great to also graced by an all original Barnett CD soon.\n", "val": 0.007925999350845814}
{"text": "Man these guys are prolific; three CD releases in as many years.  Its kind of old school in a way; bands used to operate like this as opposed to the longer intervals that tend to be more common now.  Its nice to see though; there seems to more of a tendency for evolution rather than revolution between releases.  And that's pretty much what we have with AD's newest \"End of Eden\"; its about the same size a step from \"Clouds\" as \"Clouds\" was from \"River\".So first off, its the same AD we all know and love.  Razor sharp, extremely melodic, pretty speedy, and exquisite vocals from Heidi.  Honestly, if I was in a Finnish metal band now I'd probably be depressed just because the technical standard is so high; I don't know how AD could be better in that respect.  As was the case with the previous two CDs; there are a couple of songs that just jumped out at me; that would be \"Arctica\" and \"Field of Serpents\".  \"Arctica\" just because its so catchy and crafted so well and \"Field of Serpents\" because of its little arrangement surprises.  Most of the other songs are really good as well; seems you start to get a little desensitized to how good they are that just because its so routine for AD.  Just as the previous two CDs, I do think \"End of Eden\" has some flat spots.  Those would \"Virvatulen Laulu\" and maybe, to some extent, within the closer \"War in Heaven\".  The former because its a straight operatic exercise that doesn't seem to fit in too well with the rest of the songs and the latter because its only good, not great (clunky male vocals and it just needs a bit more impact).The differences this time are generally a plus.  \"End of Eden\" has a bigger more expansive sound. Its a got a nice consistent atmosphere; even though Tuomas Seppala has said its not a concept album, it does tend to create that kind of impression.  In \"End of Eden\", it really seems to me that Heidi's voice and the band's instrumentation is balanced much more evenly than before.  The previous two CDs had a bit of a feeling that Heidi's voice was floating on top of the band; it has a much more integrated feel here.  Its partly the result of a better mix, but more so, I think, of Tuomas & Heidi learning to mesh more effectively as time goes on.  To that last point, it seems that Heidi's vocal performance and arrangements are more restrained this time, but that could turn out to be a plus in terms of how this CD ages.  There are some longer songs on this and a bit less predictability - both pluses because one could contend that aspect of AD's writing (song structure, length, & arrangement) has been somewhat formulaic.  Its also heavier sounding, as Tuomas promised, and even though there is room for progress on mid-tempo heavy songs (eg \"War in Heaven\"), AD has taken some positive steps in that direction.  Tuomas has also said that he can't see any reason why AD wouldn't go on for 10 years or more; based on what we've seen so far, one would expect to see the pattern of frequent releases and evolutionary steps to continue.  AD is a really strong band with a lot of upside.  Part of me wants to see them take a giant step and push the whole genre forward; there are so many hints, within all three of their CDs, that they are capable of that.  But another part wants them to keep on going as they are; though one sometimes encounters a sentiment that there are boatloads of female fronted melodic metal bands around; I don't think there are enough, definitely not ones of this caliber.So, which AD release to buy?  Doesn't really matter...all three are excellent.  Fans of power metal, melodic metal, more awesomeness from Finland, whatever you want to call it, should be well pleased with any AD release.  And for fans of female fronted version of same...no brainer...get all three of them!\n", "val": 0.004227056168019772}

{"text": "Tyr have created an excellent album once again. Musically speaking, most of this album resembles past songs like \"Hold the Heathen Hammer High\" and \"By the Sword in my Hand\". As usual there are a lot of Norse Pagan themes in their songs, although there are fewer traditional songs set to heavy metal than usual on this album. Lyrically speaking, there is a consistant theme throughout virtually all of their songs, and that is the idea of freedom from tyranny. I'm not saying that this has not been a theme in the past for them, but Tyr has without doubt set this as a theme for their entire album.I decided to listen to this new album with an open ear from the start. In the past I had been surprised at how different the last album was compared to previous albums. At first I almost did not like it, but after I listended to it the second time I decided I liked it a lot. The same has been true for this album as well. I am especially fond of their second song, titled \"Shadow of the Swastika\". This song sets the record straight in no uncertain terms what they think about being accused of being Fascists, Nazi sympathizers, neo - nazis, and racists in general. It's basically one giant \"F-you!\" to all of those groups mentioned, which is something that I can appreciate on a personal level.Overall this album is one of my favorites. If I have any criticism for it, it's that there were not enough traditional Scandinavian melodies in the album. They did put in 2 traditional songs, but they did not have the same impact as, say, Sinklars Visa did. For anyone who is a fan of Tyr's previous albums I would highly recommend this one. They continue to deliver a unique sound in the Vking Metal genre where you find mostly Death Metal bands and Black Metal bands who, although excellent, seem less connected with their traditional Scandinavian heritage than Tyr.\"May Thor's example guide my actions, and Odin's wisdom guide my journey\"\n", "val": 0.014505356550216675}

{"text": "Paramore has been going through some rough times lately. After pulling things together for 'brand new eyes', arguably their best effort to date, the two Farro brothers broke away from the band, leaving lead singer Hayley Williams with the two remaining members. They blamed their departure on the red-head's self-centered ways, and maybe they were correct. A lot of fans wondered whether or not the band would ever be the same.It is safe to say that not much is missed without the Farro brothers. This comes as a shock, considering that the chief songwriter is gone, but with lyrics such as 'call me a traitor, I'm just collecting your victims', it doesn't seem as though he is needed any longer. The sound of the band remains moderately unchanged, though this song is a bit heavier than their older material. However, considering the subject matter, it's likely less due to the switch-up in members and more due to the topic at hand.It remains to be seen if Paramore's next full-length effort will provide the same affecting ruminations and catchy rhythms as their first trio of releases. However, with Hayley's respectably talented pipes and the group's remaining knack for confessional songcraft, so far it sounds like nothing has really changed at all, which is all for the better.\n", "val": 0.00011030863242922351}
{"text": "This is it ladies and gentlemen!  The first song from the new Paramore (sans the Farro brothers who left rather abruptly late last year).  Like many fans I was worried that Paramore was not going to survive the loss of these two talented musicians, and that the band would dissolve and fade away.  I'm so glad that I was wrong!  With Monster, the remaining members of Paramore (Hayley, Jeremy and Taylor) are making it clear that they're not planning on going anywhere.The lyrics of Monster feel like a natural end to 2009's Brand New Eyes.  BNE was written by lead singer Hayley Williams about the internal struggles the band faced in 2008 that almost broke the band apart.  Most of the problems centered around former band member Josh Farro and songs like Ignorance and Playing God made that frustration known.  Now with Monster, Paramore addresses the loss of the Farros and announces \"Now that you're gone the world is ours.\"  Monster seems to be the resolution to BNE and a declaration of the new Paramore's independence.Musically, the only concern I had was that the drums feel a little soft on the track.  I think it was simply a mixing issue and that once performed live the drums will be more evident and powerful.  Otherwise Monster is brilliant all the way through.  Taylor's lead work is great and Jeremy's bass is a solid foundation allowing Hayley's vocals and lyrics shine.To sum it up Monster is a perfect jumping on point for people new to Paramore, and a must have for long time fans.  BNE is in the past and if Monster is any indication of the future, I can't wait to hear the future! Paramore is (still) a Band!\n", "val": 0.010805748403072357}

{"text": "I will use the saying \"if it's not broke don't fix it\" to emphasize my displeasure with this remake. The original song had heart and really climaxed toward the end. However, Valora's Syd Duran seems to destroy what heart this song had. Just as the song is about to explode at the end, she comes in and totally destroys all emotions. It's not that I dislike female vocalists as I love Skillet's female vocalist Jen Ledger, but it just seems that Syd was too high pitched and all over the place destroying the song's emotion. Basically, I'd compare it to being in church and having some deaf lady in the choir butchering every song. This has happened before, believe me.I would put this in the category of \"WTF\" along with most of Linkin Park's remakes and Hollywood Undead's new album. Still love Breaking Benjamin though and listen to them everyday when I'm in the gym, however, this song will not be one of them.\n", "val": 1.4335644664242864e-05}

{"text": "** and 1/2.The American saxophonist Paul Taylor is primarily an instrumentalist, but ironically, the best tracks on his albums are usually the ones that feature vocalists -- and that holds true on \"Prime Time\", which is mostly an instrumental smooth jazz album but features R&B singers on occasion.The vocal offerings include \"Space\" (which features singer Andrea Anderson-Olson) and \"Can't Nobody\", which features Jamie Jones of All-4-One fame; both are medium-tempo R&B of the urban contemporary variety. Taylor solos on both tunes, but the vocal performances make them the best tracks on this 2011 release.Unfortunately, the instrumentals on \"Prime Time\" aren't nearly as substantial, which isn't surprising given Taylor's history.Since the 1990s, the Denver native has been playing \"safe sax\" of the Kenny G/Dave Koz/Richard Elliot/George Howard variety; that approach has made him a favorite on smooth jazz stations, but for those who are interested in hearing more than just lightweight background music, that automatic-pilot approach gets old in a hurry.From \"Moment of Truth\" to \"Laronda\" to \"Say No More\", \"Prime Time\" is full of formulaic instrumentals that are more than happy to fade into the background.The album also includes a note-for-note cover of the Kings of Leon's 2008 hit \"Use Somebody\", which Taylor performs as an instrumental.Some jazz purists would fault Taylor for embracing something by an alternative pop/rock group like Kings of Leon, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with Taylor recording \"Use Somebody.\" The fact is that jazz instrumentalists have a long history of taking mainstream popular songs and using them as vehicles for personal expression.Regrettably, what Taylor does with \"Use Somebody\" sounds vacuous and superficial rather than personal, which is a shame because like so many people in smooth jazz, Taylor has the chops and the talent to offer more than just elevator music.But again, \"Prime Time\" has its moments -- and \"Can't Nobody\" and \"Space\" are easy to like even though Taylor, from a creative standpoint, sells himself short on the smooth jazz instrumentals that dominate this 41-minute CD.

I jumped for joy when I found out his new CD had been released (thanks Facebook) and was soooo hoping this one was worth the wait. He did not disappoint...this one is the true Paul Taylor sound!

There are so many cuts on here to like--I'm in heaven! I don't know why but I am very partial to the compositions with Paul and Dino Esposito--their collaborations are so very special. My hands-down favorites on this release are Push to Start, Moment of Truth, Horizon, Say No More, and Use Somebody. The Prime Time cut is reminiscent of the Johnson Brothers back in the 70's--remember them?...I do!  I can live without the vocals on this CD...I don't think they add anything special.

{"text": "Emos in Austin was packed tonight. Cold drinks and warm people had condensation appearing on them. Breezes in the room and sips of our drink provided temporary relief from the stuffy body heat. The crowd salivated in anticipation of the musical entre that was to be laid before them. People began applauding and calling out as the band took their places on stage. A surreal and electric atmosphere set in as their singer took his stand at the microphone with hair down and acoustic guitar strapped over his shoulder. The lights dimmed. With the click of sticks the band locked into the tempo then, in unison, began their first spellbinding song of the night. Josh Garrels and his band began two of the most enjoyable musical hours of my life. Garrels has this effect with all of his music. The climate of his hometown, Portland, Oregon, can be heard in his self-produced albums. In particular, his album Love & War & The Sea In Between echoes the light rain and mist covered cliffs of the northwest coast. Mysterious and melancholy tones permeate Garrels first song on the album; White Owl and ends with the reflective instrumental, Processional, that calls listeners to respond to the hour of music that massaged their ears (Garrels). This album is a must have because of Garrels spectacular vocals, introspective lyrics, and strategic song variety. Josh Garrels has a stellar singing voice. He has the voice of an angel. His voice has an incredible range, yet it does not get shrill as he sings falsetto. He, somehow, possesses the ability to sing high notes and maintain a smoky and full-bodied voice that does not make a listener wince, but drops their jaw in wonder. Often times, singers do not possess the same voice in concert as they do in their studio recordings, but Garrels is one of the few that sound even better in concerts than in his studio recordings. The track Ulysses displays the vocal prowess of Garrels most prominently as he sustains powerful high notes that would make even the most seasoned of sailors tear up, but his angelic vocal style is not the only awe-inspiring aspect of this album. The first encounter with this album is perplexing because of the song diversity. Garrels does not fall neatly into a subcategory of music but dances from one to the other. The first song would make someone assume he belongs in a singer-songwriter category. However, The Resistance would make someone think Garrels is a hip hop artist who raps and uses a lot of sampling in his songs. Additionally, songs like Beyond The Blue and For You display his wonderful folk sound. This album laughs at anyone who wants to put Garrels into a specific music box. The variety of music types on the album adds to its sophistication and peeks the listeners curiosity. The variety of the album is supported by the diverse beauty of orchestration, instrumentals, and samples organized by Garrels. He has strategic instrumentals between certain songs that aim to make the listener feel a certain way. The titles of the instrumentals help the listener understand what he is trying to get across. Titles such as Far-Off Hope make the listener feel hopeless while making them strain their eyes to the horizon to see what little light may give them that hope to cross the sea. These songs display his ability to create tracks and allow the listener an opportunity to digest what they have consumed in their aural journey. Orchestration for each song is beautifully designed, while also being expertly placed and organized. Sampling from instruments that range from organs to cellos, Garrels teases and pulls peoples ears, urging them to plunge into the depths of each song. Listeners pick up new things each time they listen to a song again. The more I listen, decipher, and enjoy this album; the more interesting it becomes.The lyrics of all these songs demand afterthought and further soul searching. Garrels is a Christian singer-songwriter, who poetically describes the deep struggles, questions, and tribulations people face. The albums first song, White Owl describes the path people take through this life and the trouble of finding a guide to navigating the various twists and turns humanity goes through. In Slip Away he discusses the intense and searing pain of betraying those who love him most. Garrels then further details about this struggle in his song Ulysses as he discusses loving someone despite trials that assail him and try to distract and drag him away from the subject of his love. These lyrics describe the predicament of loving someone deeply despite the temptations and distractions of the world as well as from within ourselves. These are just some of the poetic ideas he discusses in his lyrics. There are also threads of courage and standing up for what is right throughout the songs. The Resistance is Garrels call to arms as he asks those listening to resist the failing things of this world, to stand up for those things that will last, and hold onto divine love. The song paints the picture of being snared by the monotony and failed things of the world but breaking free of the cycle by holding on to the anchor of divine love that is never broken despite the multitudes of waves that batter it. Later in the album Garrels hangs his head for the last time and proclaims that he will never turn around again as he faces this oppressive and dark world and will take courage to face his fears and overcome them by divine love. He claims that the only solution to the darkness, swords, and severe oppression is the redemption brought about by the love of the Lord. The courage he calls the audience to is sustained, and resourced, by this divine love that overcomes all wrong. Josh Garrels has an uncanny voice, deep lyrics, and an ability to create instrumentals with orchestrations that call the listener deeper into his music. His songs are immediately provocative, yet subliminally linger as one walks away with their hand on their chin pondering the musical encounter they just had. There is a spiritual quality to his music that does not push away people who do not have faith in a God or religion. Instead, his music invites the listener to think and wonder about the emotions and struggles he portrays with his incredible musical ability .\n", "val": 0.009168126620352268}

Introduced as a Christian singer who only rarely mentioned the name \"Jesus\", I thought of many of us who have developed an allergy to too much preaching... so I gave it a listen. Wow. I stayed stuck on the song Slip Away for months, because as a Roman Catholic, it called to me as the perfect song of contrition.  It's that place of deep humbleness in the heart that must precede the joyfulness and celebration of our faith. But now on down the road, I'm discovering each song anew, as a fresh meditation on some aspect of my own Christian/spiritual journey.  It's hard to find a voice so authentic and sure, and so I'm deeply grateful for this CD and hoping that Josh is working on more for us all.\n", "val": 0.009039861150085926}

The more I have come to know the songs, the more powerful they seem, which is altogether different from most Christian music, much of which has the initial power to move and inspire, but soon becomes overly familiar and diminishes the power to move a person on a deeper level of the heart.

{"text": "As forefront music now-a-days seems to depend on auto-tune and singers who need other people to write their lyrics for them, Josh Garrels came to me like a fresh breeze. He's a musician, he's an artist, he's a writer, he's a singer. On this album, every song belongs to him excpet for the hymn he brings to life. His lyrics are rich, they strike deep, they make me want to linger on them. On paper, they could be poems, each so carefully constructed, each lyric flowing into the other so effortlessly.Garrels' music refreshes, revitalizes, and challenges.My husband stumbled upon Garrels earlier this year, and we both were instantly fascinated by him. The sound of his voice, so unique and instantly recognizable on the radio, stands out among a sea of artists who all sound the same, who all sing the same kind of lyrics over and over. Garrels doesn't hide his faith; this is a CD based on his love for Jesus Christ, and his songs reflect the freedom, redemption, and hardships a human faces throughout life. They are the very essence of a man striving for something more in life, to not be satisfied by earthly things or desires, but to find the connection between the created and the Creator.The music is haunting, ethereal, and like nothing else I have ever heard. He gives the instruments their own voices, their own stories, and they somehow connect to us.I cannot say anything more upstanding about him; here is sheer talent, here is someone who is glorifying something greater than himself, who has his finger on the very pulse of humanity and that shines through his lyrics and music.For that, he is my best discovery of 2012.\n", "val": 0.041765328496694565}

{"text": "I have listened to and really appreciated Josh Garrels for a while now. I am sure there are a lot of Josh's listeners who like all of his music just how it is. I grew up listening to heavy music, but now find I really prefer folk songs and spiritual compositions that are mostly acoustic. Since many of Josh's songs have a surf/rap/beat style, what attracts me to him? First, I got hooked by some acoustic spirituals he did. Second, his lyrical offerings and vocals are so captivating. Some of his songs show some mighty fine material for Christian contemplation and conduct, and I like the way he communicates it all. As on Josh's prior albums, the pieces on this album I could definitely do without are the rap/beat pieces. Actually, when Josh performs live, especially when he is alone or with a couple of other acoustics, all of his music is great. When he is required to take some of these electro- and beat-based songs and must perform them live, in a living-room or coffee-house style, this is where Josh's real talent and ability come forth. I have really wondered if Josh knows how many people would be ministered to if he kept his talents and focus and style, but expressed it all through a real retrograde expression. Not sure whether that is neo, hill-billy, bluegrass, traditional, Appalachian, or something else, but my listening ear believes that Josh's upbeat songs have a bit of CCM feel to them. I don't think that style really expresses his message or persona well. For that reason, I like this album less than any prior album. It had less of what I really liked about Josh Garrels and his music. I know it may suit others just great, I know he has won album of the year with this album, but for me as a listener, it wasn't a move in the right direction. Josh, if you ever put together a live or acoustic work, I will snap it right up. I hope you get radical and return to some of the roots of the music you are playing.When trying to decide a rating for this album, I hovered between 3 and 4 stars, and figured that at least half a star was there because of my appreciation for his prior work. Three and a half is what I really want to give it. Just to be clear about this work compared to his prior work, although all of his albums have some rap/beat on them, I felt I was more easily able to pick and choose or avoid. It is not in every song on this album either, but it felt like it was encroaching on the beauty even more than before. I know it is probably out of the question for Josh, but I would love to hear him bring a few of the Brother Sun, Sister Moon songs into his acoustical style, or even redo the whole soundtrack. My favorite song here is \"Farther Along\" and a few others make the grade, but I recommend anything prior to this album. Here is one listener hoping his next album doesn't continue in the same direction.\n", "val": 0.005872269161045551}

{"text": "You probably won't hear Josh Garrels on your local Christian radio station, even in light of his 'Christianity Today' Album of the year award. He's too good. His music isn't the \"pretty\" and stereotypical formula mainstream praise. His lyrics are gritty, thought provoking, inspiring, beautiful and yet also full of praise but with much deeper meaning. He raises questions from a Christian heart and challenges us to live the example.  His words tell his story of salvation, and God's grace and impact in his life and what God has provided for us all. His vocals are incredible, his control and transition from low range to an almost yodel, and up to falsetto are masterful and seamless. You won't hear anyone else like him. God gave him a uniqueness and gift that he puts to use singing his praises. It takes a pass or two through the album to get the full and true meaning of the lyrics. His website has this very album and full lyrics of every song on it. The album is available there for free download as a gift for all from Josh.

The essence behind all of the tracks on this CD is so powerful, contains such depth, such REALness, such life, mysticism, intelligent philosophy and love that every time I listen to the whole CD or a single song I'm moved.  This music transports me to the eternal truth of God's love, but not in an obvious way.  It also dives directly into the simple facts and truths of this human journey, which helps me to relate to Mr. Garrels personally.  Each individual track contains it's own unique message and character.  Each track on this album has a unique artistic flavor, which keeps my attention- there are not many CDs that are able to consistently hold my attention throughout the entire album- plus there's 18 songs!  Some songs are purely instrumental and are still just as captivating.  The beats in the songs are funky, forward, grabby, and catchy.

{"text": "This album has revived me in so many ways, I can't put them all into words.  I was completely amazed at \"Farther Along\" as I was just expecting a gentle \"cover\" of a familiar song.Then with \"The Resistance\", I immediately thought, \"This isn't my kind of music.\" as it had too much of a hip-hop, rap feel that I've never found to be enjoyable to listen to.  And yet, after repeated listenings (and taking my finger off choosing the tracks, and letting the album unfold in the order given), thankfully my mind was opened.There is not a bad song on this album.  By this, I mean that after a few listens you may not want to skip any songs as they all have their place.\"White Owl\" - still remains a riddle I try to figure out and then give up and enjoy.  It's almost as if it's telling the listener that what is to be found in the following Sea will require some effort to mine it for all that is contains.\"Flood Waters\" - it was here that I knew I would really give the entire album a chance, as I enjoyed the gentle acoustic guitar foundations that seem to swim around.\"Farther Along\" - close your eyes, get in a quiet place, don't be alarmed when the beat changes, give the entire thing a chance, and let the tears flow down the cheeks.\"A Far-Off Hope\" - calming instrumental leading the way into the quite different landscape of...\"The Resistance\" - I was entirely opposed to this song with my first listen. I skipped it so many times before giving it a chance.  Now it's entirely essential.\"Slip Away\" - The entrance into a somber portion of the album.  This song is convicting and as long as you still have breathe in your lungs, you will find it seems to say just what you've never been able to say.\"Sailor's Waltz\" - instrumental where the title says it all.  It slowly builds up and I think it acts as a bridge from the darkness of \"Slip Away\" the island in the center of this entire beast to...\"Ulysses\" - With the background of Homer's Odyssey, this amazing tale manages walk the fine line of love to another person to love to the Creator of all things.  With this, the somber, slower, portion of this Sea is left behind for the radiance of...\"Beyond the Blue\" - This and \"Farther Along\" are the ones that I present to people when I ask them, \"You ever hear of Josh Garrels?\".\"For You\" - very gentle and deceivingly simple sounding.\"Million Miles\" - yet another song I was initially turned off to upon first listen.  It just seemed too rough after so many comforting acoustic guitars swaying for the previous songs.  Now I recognize it for what it is: A different style than what I would choose, but completely welcome and pleasing to these ears and this heart.\"Bread & Wine\" - this soft acoustic gem seems to always get lost in my recollection of this album, and yet it's a shame if it were to get buried among its louder neighbors.\"No Man's Land\" - instrumental.  Upon repeated listenings, you'll hear this one as what accompanies you into the desert where there will be much to witness in the next few songs.\"Rise\" - this anthem, this psalm, it just screams to be tattooed on our chests as we stand.  It is bold and you will find unable to sit still with it's claims.\"Revelator\" - this dream of what's to be revealed whisps through the air and should be essential listening to any study of what's reported that John saw as he spent time on the island.  This song managed to both instill hope in this weary soul as well as scare me with the reminder of what the Lord is really capable of.\"Pilot Me\" - this bounces as we're making our way back out of the album.  With repeated listenings, this acts as kind of a sad farewell, similar to seeing that loved one board that plane and, while knowing you'll see them again, you still have to go through that Goodbye.\"Processional\" - instrumental with some soaring vocals.  The album has said what it needed to say.  I guess Josh said what he needed to say, and the Spirit spoke through him and has accomplished this final task.  This song will end, but you have it set to \"repeat\" anyway, so back to \"White Owl\".Check out Josh's website and support him please, rather than purchasing his songs through here.  It's dark out there in the music world and of course in the World itself.  What actually gets exposed to the general masses as what is actually representative of what Jesus had to say is pretty sad at times.  It would do a lot of good if these tunes found their way into some playlists or car rides with a co-worker or summer evenings of just hanging out with friends.

Her tone, pitch, phrasing are second to none and, after a final, emotional repeat of the phrase \"For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever\", she ends with a reverent \"Amen\". Spectacular art. Reverent prayer.\n", "val": 0.023628121241927147}
{"text": "Although Ms Evancho has one of the most beautiful voices in the world, certain songs do not serve her well. This particular song has become iconic because of its use in a humane treatment of animals campaign. Hence, if the treatment of the song is classical rather than emotional, it is almost impossible for the comparison to be favorable.Ms Evancho, I have loved your voice since you surprised us on America's Got Talent. Is it possible for a classically trained voice to relax when singing popular music? I have never heard a classical singer do it well (by pop music standards), but you could be the first!Several months have passed and my opinion has softened, possibly because of DMC's announcement of his experience with the original recording. In any case, thank you, Ms Evancho, for sharing your gift.\n", "val": 0.003140814136713743}

For me, I am somewhat new to listening to Jackie Evancho, yet I will stay listening to her music and downloading more. What is so special to me about her music is that she sings from her heart.

So if you are picking up this song for pure rap lyricism, you are definitely going to be disappointed.However, that doesn't mean the style points that have made both men famous aren't there.  The cadence of the song moves every bit as smoothly as I've ever expected from either and that slick tempo creates a surprising balance with the refrain sung by the sweet-toned Bruno Mars.

{"text": "\"Resonance\" is extremely, and I do mean extremely serene. Some might refer to it minimalistic, while others call it meditative. But with it's washes of synthesizer and sampled orchestral sounds, it reminded me of some of the music that was beginning to be labeled \"new age\" when I first became a music reviewer back in the 1980's - in particular some of the seminal early recordings of Steve Roach, Robert Rich, Deuter, and others. It has also been likened to the \"Liquid Mind\" albums by Chuck Wild and I can see the basis for comparison. The music on \"Resonance\" is very dreamy and slow moving which works well as a background for meditation, massage, yoga, etc. A picturesque description in the album's promo gives a sense of the music within: \"Some tracks evoke the sweeping vastness of outer space while others bring to mind the sensation of witnessing the deepening twilight of a day's conclusion right here on planet Earth.\"For a full length review of this CD, as well as others, please visit: michaeldiamondmusic.com\n", "val": 0.011938474141061306}

The lads of Def Leppard mixed the songs on this album through the microphones on the stage so their voices are crystal clear!!  The voice quality almost reaches that of a studio recording.  First level are the lads singing; second level is their instruments and third level is the audience.  The type of recordning reminds me of a small bar gig where you would hear the voices above everything else.  If I could give this album more than 5 stars I would!!  My only hope for future live albums from Def Leppard would be that they include a solo from the Thunder God!\n", "val": 0.000505611882545054}

{"text": "It's hard to believe that this is Def Leppard's first live album. The band has been at it for more than 30 years so you'd figure they would have released a number of live albums by now. The deluxe edition of Pyromania has a second disc of live tracks but as good as it is, it's not an official live release. In 2011 we finally have a first official live Def Leppard album release, the Wal-Mart exclusive 2 CD/1 DVD collection Mirrorball: Live & More. Mirrorball, while not a spectacular live album remains a good one that should please the curious Leppard fan. Some of these live versions are interesting because they have certain twist or something different to them for instance the first half of \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" which is acoustic (and later kicks into the high gears when the guitars come in), the 7 plus minute version of \"Love Bites\" and the great riff intro on \"Pour Some Sugar On Me\" which sounds heavier and cooler than the original.The performances on Mirrorball were recorded in 2008 and 2009 during the Songs from the Sparkle Lounge tour. The band played the classics that the fans would expect to play along with some more recent songs. \"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\" is a highlight of Mirroball for me and having \"Switch 625\" follow it is a nice addition (excellent guitar work). I love the energetic version of \"Animal\", I also thought \"Rock of Ages\" was great but then again most of the songs here are played very well. I don't have much to criticize Mirroball for, at this point of the band's career this live album is excellent and I don't regret my purchase at all I find plenty to like here. Some songs work and sound better than other but that's only normal. I think the crowd sounds just right, mixed neither too loud or too low and at some points you can really sense that there was something special going on, that the crowd were into it. My only problem is why not earlier guys? A live album from the band's earlier years and more successful period would've been great.There are mixed opinions but Joe Elliott sounds pretty good for his age and he still gets it done. He sounds better on certain songs than other where his vocal limits are exposed. That said he can still get a crowd going and has a lot of energy. The guitars on Mirrorball sound great, there's some very good guitar work here courtesy of Phil Collen and Vivian Campbell and some of the stuff is impressive I must say. The rhythm section of bassist Rick Savage and drummer Rick Allen is tight. I'm particularly impressed with Allen's performance on the album as his drumming is constant and there are plenty of great drum fills throughout this live album.As for the new songs, \"Undefeated\" sounds like a modern take on \"Pour Some Sugar On Me\", it has a good country-rock riff going on. I get the impression that the band was going for an anthem with this one. I'm not a huge fan of the song, it's not bad at all but at the same time it's not that great, a nice attempt. Now I don't mean to be harsh on Def Lepp but \"Kings of the World\" and \"It's All About Believin'\" sound both a bit like filler material to me (with \"Kings\" being the best between those two), they would obviously not be highlights of a new studio album let's put it that way.Mirrorball: Live & More is a nice package at a decent price (at Wal-Mart that is): 21 live songs, 3 new tracks and a DVD. For the price it's a great value. However, I think the band missed an opportunity with the DVD. This was a chance for the band to included a full live show which would have been the ultimate package. Don't get me wrong I like the 4 songs and the 2 videos that are on the DVD, it looks very nice and all but an entire concert would've made Mirrorball much better for fans. Also, am I the only one who's not a fan of the artwork (or maybe I'm the only who actually cares)?I love hearing those classics live but the new songs are simply not doing it for me, although it is cool to have something new included with this live album. Personally I just wish the band would have decided to record a live album earlier during their career, it would have been amazing had a proper live album with Steve Clark seen the light of day (there' still the live stuff on the Pyromania deluxe edition for that). Your best bet is truly buying Mirrorball at Wal-Mart where you can get a much better deal than you would shopping online (Bought my copy for 12$). I'll give the album 3.5/5 stars, not perfect in any way but the band can still deliver the goods live and Mirrorball is in my opinion an enjoyable live album for a classic band.\n", "val": 0.023407328873872757}

{"text": "Do yourself a favor and get the In The Round In Your Face DVD and the Video Archive one, get a DVD ripper and get those 2 DVDs into mp3, and you'll get a better deal than this Live CD from Def Leppard.  This record brings nothing of value to music, and you'll forget about the new tunes by tomorrow.  If you expected the classical intro's for Hysteria or Rocket, forget it, not here.  If you liked the Led Zeppelin medleys they used to do with Rock of Ages or Rocket, or the Black Betty intro for Armaggedon It, forget it too.  If you liked Pour Some Sugar On Me, you'll see how Vivian Campbell can completely mess up a classic (Steve Clarke nailed it on the first live DVD I mentioned).Oh, and instead of Bad Actress (who the hell cares about that song!), Action and Rock On, they could have included something from Slang or Euphoria, or even better, Wasted or Mirror Mirror from On Through the Night and High N Dry.They added nothing special to any of the songs, they just played them the same as if you bought the original songs and added screams in the background, except for Sugar, which they messed up big, and Lets Get Rocked, which the only speed up.  Oh, and on the Bringing on the Heartbreak chorus, you'll hear the public singing it perfectly, but you'll notice that probably only 40 year old and older chicks sing in there.Now, regarding the new songs, ALL FORGETTABLE.  Undefeated is as boring as they can get.  Kings of the World is a Queenesque song and they're not even good at it, and the last It's All About Believing is more pop than rock, and kind of a U2 wannabe song.Get the older live dvd's and move along, this ain't no classic.

I would imagine most buyers are purchasing this so they can focus on other things (sleeping, working, reading), not the track itself.My only caution would be that there is a clear point every 35 or 36 seconds that the track repeats.  I anticipated the same clip to be repeated throughout; however, I expected it to be a longer clip (maybe 5-10 minutes, not 35 seconds).  There is a very slight increase in the volume each time it repeats, and it's barely noticeable, but it IS noticeable.  If you're very detail oriented (like me), this may bother you enough that you won't want to listen to this if you're trying to concentrate on something else.There is the slightest bit of distant thunder, which I like.  Assuming the track does continue to repeat the same 35-second clip for the remainder of the hour (I haven't finished listening to it yet), there is no sound of cars or trucks going by on a busy highway...and that's a good thing.Overall, this is a great value.

{"text": "I work in a cubicle farm in a large office (think of the movie Office Space), and certain individuals seem to feel it is their responsibility to carry on conversations loud enough so the entire floor can hear every inane word they say. They do not seem to care that other employees may be working on documents and projects that require concentration. I also sit right next to a bank of elevators, so all day long (because people are too lazy to take the stairs), I hear the constant ding of the elevators and the chatter of lazy people waiting for the elevator.I downloaded this MP3, and astonishingly, it got around the company firewall. When I plugged my earbuds in, pressed play, and then put on my $20 Peltor ear muffs on top of the earbuds, my stress level went way down. I could not hear a single office noise--not the conversations from the 20-somethings without kids, not the beeping coffee maker or the dinging elevator, and not the horrible, irritating giggle of that one coworker who walks around minding everyone else's business.This MP3 is just a steady rainfall, with no noticeable thunder and no animal or other sounds, just steady rain.

Then, some years later, I was dining in a Mexican restaurant and the instrumentalists came by our table and asked for requests. I asked if they could play \"La Bikina\". To my surprise, they played it! Anyway, when I did my search, one of the first matches that came up was Luis Miguel's video. What a treat! Then I looked for it on CD and found this collection. Since the video had been so well done, live, with a live orchestra and mariachi, I thought the record company must really value their singer because they put so much into backing him up.

{"text": "Garland Jeffreys music has always been a part of my life. The 8 tracks were in my car, LP's on my turntable and all of those great records have been on my iPod for years now. I wouldn't call this a comeback record because Garland never went away. He just took a 19 year break between releases in the US. I remember earlier this year hearing the buzz about a new Garland Jeffreys record and hoping it was going to really happen. Well Folks,......IT'S HERE !!!! Titled, \"The King Of In Between\", this is as perfect as the rest of GJ's work and perhaps his most solid effort since `81's \"Escape Artist\". 12 Brand New songs from one of the most underrated songwriters of the last 35 years. G's writing is similar to Springsteen in that his songs are very visual, like movies. You can actually see the songs run in your mind.. This is apparent right off the bat with \"Coney Island Winter\", a great song. Slowly building into an all out rocker with the singer telling us about the 22 stops it takes to get from Coney Island into Manhattan. Garland rocks out with another great band behind him and you can hear them go at it on \"I'm Alive\" & \"Rock n Roll Music\"..  On \"The Contortionist\", another song with a nice groove, you can hear Garland's daughter, Savannah on top of Lou Reed's backing vocal. He seems to get a little more grungier & bluesier than previous outings. This is obvious on tracks like \"Love Is A Clich\" & \"Until John Lee Hooker Calls Me\", where he lets us know he's in no hurry to dust his broom. Then you listen to the festival feel of \"Roller Coaster Town\" and you realize that Garland Jeffreys has done it again. This record has Reggae, Zydeco, Blues, Soul, RB, Folk & Rock n Roll all mixed throughout which make it a treat every time you throw it on. Garl's STILL angelic voice shines thru on \"In God's Waiting Room\" & \"The Beautiful Truth\". Jeffreys loves covers and has done a killer job in the past of choosing which tracks to cover. Usually they're one hit wonders. This time out Garland covers David Essex' 1971 hit \"Rock On\". I love the original so I was excited to hear this !! It's the final, hidden bonus track here. Awesome !! This is an incredible record from top to bottom. If you're a fan you've probably already got this. If not, HURRY !!! If you aren't sure about this guy's music, start here and go backwards...... What an outstanding collection of songs he's given us through the past 3 plus decades. I love this album! Look for Garland on the road, any time you can see Garland live is a joyous experience ! LONG LIVE GARLAND JEFFREYS !!!!\n", "val": 0.026110084727406502}

Filled with Jeffrey's eclectic mix of rock, blues, soul and reggae, \"The King of In Between\" is laced with incredibly catchy material - maybe his best since 1981's \"Escape Artist\". \"Coney Isand Winter\" is a fresh sounding, mesmerizing rocker. \"Streetwise\" sounds like a classic 70's detective show theme song (think \"Baretta\"). \"I'm Alive\", floated out on Jeffreys greatest hits album a few year back (buy it for the updated version \"Matador\" alone!), perhaps underscores the album's reflective message: Jeffreys is not only alive, but still creating some thoroughly enjoyable, thoughtful songs. His love of music, the nourishment it has provided him over his life, is evident all over the album including \"Love is Not Cliche\", \"In God's Waiting Room\", \"\"Rock and Roll Music\", \"til John Lee Hooker Calls Me\", and a spirited cover of David Essex's \"Rock On\" (a song Jeffreys often plays in concert).

{"text": "Garland's long-awaited comeback album kicks off with the steamy rocker, \"Coney Island Winter\" and concludes with \"God's Waiting Room\", a contemplative acoustic blues pieces, in which the singer reflects on his mortality with a dignified acceptance of the past and the inevitable future. In between, he visits his familiar musical haunts, concocting his distinctive distillation of rock, soul, reggae, r & b, blues and folk, while proving that his vast vocal abilities have remained undiminished. Thematically, the songs seem to embrace the day-to-day challenges of everyday people, with perhaps a tad less focus on the racial issues that drove his classic \"Ghostwriter\" album and his provocative 1992 release, \"Don't Call Me Buckwheat\". The streets of New York City and in particular, those of his Brooklyn hometown, provide much of the inspiration. 1981's \"Escape Artist\" may have been Garland's most radio-friendly album, with upbeat rock songs such as \"Modern Lovers\", \"R.O.C.K.\" and the definitive remake of \"96 Tears\". But with the introspection and wisdom of the new songs, including \"The Cortotionist\", \"til John Lee Hooker Calls Me\" and \"The Beautiful Truth\", we find an artist who has never stopped observing, learning and growing.Michael Eidman\n", "val": 0.015803560614585876}
{"text": "Garland Jeffreys makes a triumphant return with The King Of In Between (Luna Park), his first album of new material in 13 years.  Garland is Rock n Roll's version of Zelig: A constant shape-shifter who is in the scene but not necessarily part of the scene.  Is that a picture of him with Springsteen?  Yup.  Hung with Bob Marley?  That's him.  Buddies with Lou Reed?  They've been tight since Kennedy was President.  Recorded with Dr. John, Linton Kwesi Johnson, David Johansen, Nona Hendryx, Patti Austin, David `Fathead' Newman, Vernon Reid and The E Street Band?  True that.  Add to that a songwriting style that is the most insightful, bittersweet and brutally honest that you'll ever hear from an artist.  One of the last true singer-songwriters.  It's no wonder why record companies and radio stations couldn't quite figure out what box to fit him in.  He had something for everyone and it was all done well.Garland co-produced The King Of In Between with multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell (best known for his work with Bob Dylan and Levon Helm) and the roots-rock imprint is all over tracks such as `Love Like A Cliche' and `Til John Lee Hooker Calls Me'.  Rumbling like a Brooklyn-bound D train, `Coney Island Winter' has Garland using Coney Island as a metaphor to reflect on a neighborhood's past and future.  22 stops to the city indeed.  The defiant yet life affirming `I'm Alive' has hit single written all over it.  It's one of the best tracks done by ANYONE in years.  With a simple, yet memorable chorus, `I'm alive/Not dead, I'm alive, I'm alive, alive, not dead', the song just oozes soul.As the album title suggests, this collection has an array of styles.  Garland was one of the first American artists to incorporate reggae into his sound and it continues here with the rock steady beat on `All Around The World' and the stealth reggae grooves on `The Beautiful Truth'.  `Streetwise' is a hot slab of New York funk supplemented by strings.  `Rock And Roll Music' stomps like it's straight out of '56.  `The Contortionist' features doo wop background vocals by long time pal Lou Reed.  The closing track, `In God's Waiting Room is a sly look at mortality - a cross between Reverend Gary Davis and Son House.  It's a preview of what `Garland Jeffreys - Folk Singer' album could sound like.  There's also a bonus track featuring a cover of a one of the great one hit wonders of all time.  I won't say what it is, but put it this way: it stands tall with, if not exceeds, the original.Like many of his previous works (Ghost Rider, Escape Artist, Don't Call Me Buckwheat)  The King Of In Between is destined to become a classic.

{"text": "Garland Jeffreys is back, and this is easily his best album since 1981's \"Escape Artist\" and maybe even since 1977's \"Ghost Writer.\" The opening track \"Coney Island Winter\" is a magnificent marrying of words and sound and really shows that growing older, rather than slowing Garland down, has fired up his muse. The song also serves as an overture of sorts, providing the overarching theme that runs through the album. The present state of Coney Island is a mirror of the state of the country and maybe of Jeffreys himself. So much of his past is tied to Coney Island, and yet rather than a dead place, it clearly still lives on if only in memory. In fact, the power of the album derives from Jeffreys' ability to transcend what should be depressive themes: mortality, the economy, the passing of youth.The mortality theme runs throughout the album, but as the closing track \"In God's Waiting Room\" makes evident, Garland is exuberant even in his attitude towards death. Death doesn't sound so bad, either, when it comes as a call from John Lee Hooker. There is a lot of depression in the album, and yet the music is never depressing. Garland alludes to the recession several times in these songs, but always in a hopeful way. And as always, Garland shows a very sincere compassion for ordinary people, just as in his previous albums. He has clearly never lost touch with his roots.In Larry Campbell, Garland has found a very sympathetic producer. The album sounds great, and as usual, Garland, being the king of in between presents a lot of different styles, rock, R&B, ska, blues, and funk on \"Streetwise,\" a real high point on the album. Larry Campbell's string arrangements are spectacualar on this song. There are so many great musical touches on the album, like Lou Reed's backing vocals on \"The Contortionist,\" which surprisingly really suit the song, and the horns on \"Roller Coaster Town.\" Garland's voice is in top form too, and he does some great singing throughout. And as you would expect, lots of interesting, timely lyrics. I can't recommend this album highly enough, and if you can, definitely check out G live. He's doing some great shows. Now, I'm just really looking forward to his next album. But in the meantime, I know I'll be listening to this one all summer long.\n", "val": 0.03547720983624458}

The strongs are strong, as others have written, but most importantly they ring with an emotional truth that is often uplifting and with musical and lyrical hooks which grab attention. They are well produced with a raw edge and energy that is ageless, reminding us that we are never too old to be young at heart. So long as we are alive and we are alive, when we listen to The King of In Between.\n", "val": 0.05005818232893944}
{"text": "I had a feeling that when Mr. Jeffreys released his first CD in many years, the good reviews would start piling up. And so they have. I've read some of these salutes to this fine artist, so to avoid redundancy, allow my five-star rating to speak for itself. I'm going to nix the song-by-song attributes and instead express a few personal comments about the man and my thoughts regarding him. But I will affirm, as have others, that \"Coney Island Winter\" possesses all the earmarks of an enduring classic single. I've followed his musical output since he fronted the band Grinder's Switch, the original vinyl LP copy of which I still own. Mr. Jeffreys possesses one of the finest male, rock voices, whether he chooses to use it in a silky or effectively nasal manner. But hey, anyone reading this piece is already aware of that fact.I used to be a NYC native and would frequently spot him downtown browsing used record stores, flipping through the bins of tattered LPs. Garland always expressed a kind word to the owners and would talk shop as long they wanted to. I first saw Mr. Jeffreys perform at the now defunct music club, The Bottom Line. I don't recall having to endure an opening act. Mr. Jeffreys appeared as if from nowhere among the irregularly arranged tables crowded with dedicated fans and the uninitiated curious. What followed was one of the top three finest performances I had ever been fortunate to attend. On one number, an Italian accordion player entered unannounced and played next to Garland as he sang. Mr. Jeffreys wore a silken waist-length jacket with a map of Vietnam on the back, a familiar garment from my days in that country that I have since tried to bribe from him, with an eye-wink and to no avail. He informed me in his patented style of sly politeness that he had given the jacket to his daughter.Recently on Facebook, Garland presented a tribute to Douglas \"Jocko\" Henderson, one of the first popular black DJs whose career extended from 1954 to the early 70s, mostly in Philadelphia and NYC (he died at age 82 in July of 2000). Jocko filled the airwaves with his articulated yet sexy voice, often spoken in catchy rhymes, and with his R&B/doo-wop music selections. Garland Jeffreys expressed a deep respect for this off-beat and entertaining spinner of 45s. As it turned out, I owned a 1950s LP of Jocko introducing what must have been the most songs every pressed onto one slab of vinyl. I mailed it to Mr. Jeffreys as a gift and he has thanked me ever since, noting that his wife was also excited for receiving this unexpected treasure.What is the point of all this? I'm not sure, except that this \"review\" acknowledges Mr. Jeffreys' unique approach to music, which incorporates various rhythms from world music, and his genuinely amiable personality.Okay, now it's time for you to just go and buy the damn thing. The King of In Between belongs in the collection of any fastidious music lover or anyone who just enjoys shaking the proverbial booty.Harry Hughes, author of The Bait Shack and Horseshoes\n", "val": 0.01045278925448656}

{"text": "In recent reviews of his new album \"The King of In Between\" (Lunar Park Records), Garland's age is mentioned; and sometimes more than once in interviews and reviews. He's 67 (turned 68 in late June). As if to indicate its time for him to slow down; its time for him to get \"old\", stop recording and performing; that perhaps he find his \"place\". Garland Jeffreys' place is where its always been; on stage singing, performing, telling his tales, reminding us all we're still here, we still count and we should continue forward no matter what our age.On \"The King of In Between\" Garland does not disappoint. If anything, this recording is his best work. Even after years without putting out new material, he has maintained his excellent songwriting. Steadfast hooks I walk away singing (\"All Around The World\", for one). Infectious does not begin to describe it. And while his voice shows a slight rasp, he nails every note, every swoop, gliding into his falsetto like he did when I saw him at The Ritz in New York back in the early 80s, one of the many, many shows I attended back then. His phrasing is impeccable, determining which way the story goes as a result. All the \"Pop-tarts\" as I've coined them, that appear on TV on the various competition performance/singing/songwriting shows could take a HUGE lesson from Garland. And his being older only shows that he is as good if not better, than his last work/performances. In an industry that focuses so strictly on youth and image, Garland reminds us that if you stay true to your heart and your art form, it does not get \"old\".My favorite cut is \"Love Is Not A Clich\". It is haunting and the hook goes right through me. It's got almost a New Orleans groove/swamp vibe to it. It proves very successful from a songwriter's point of view; it is simple. This is the most difficult thing to achieve in songwriting; to make the statement, be musical while keeping it simple. No \"in between\" here. \"The Beautiful Truth\" sounds like it could have been on \"Wildlife Dictionary\" a 1999 recording of Garland's that was only released in Europe, and that I'm lucky to own. The entire record flows, one that you can just leave on and let it repeat, like I've done in the past 24 hours. Played it in the house, took with me in the car. A must have, and then some.I have been a fan of Garland Jeffreys since I first got serious about being a songwriter and performer. I had a manager in the early 80s who said to me \"you need to listen to Garland Jeffreys\". I jumped in, head first, and bought all of Garland's records which included his latest \"Escape Artist\". It changed my life.  As my music progressed and I had my various bands, I would perform \"Wild In The Streets\" a favorite, as an encore, and always hoped I'd done it justice. Mutual fans of Garland's have criticized me when they bore comparison of him to another Rock-n-Roll King; and I consistently argued that Garland own his own place, space, spotlight - he proves to have it, ONCE AGAIN on this recording, even after not having put out new music all these years.Garland is 14 years my senior. I can only hope that when I'm his age that I can write as brilliantly as he still does. Having seen him perform this past weekend in support of \"The King of In Between\", I hope I will have chops like he still does. Perhaps he doesn't jump as high as he used to and his voice may have a slight rasp for the wear, but his songs still ring honest, and his performance and singing razor sharp. Garland says he's on the \"90-year plan\"; I hold him to it. He shows us how it's done. I'm thrilled to own this new record. God bless Garland Jeffreys.- Lili Anel\n", "val": 0.01850089617073536}

{"text": "The terrifying thing about Memory Lane is how far back it goes. What were you wearing in 1973? I'd bet: Pampers. Me? I was out and about, listening to Garland Jeffreys.Maybe, along the way to adulthood, you heard the song:In the heat of the summerBetter call up the plumberand turn on the street pumpto cool me offWith your newspaper writersand your big crime fightersYou still need a drug storeto cure my coughRunning wild in the streets....Whatever happened to the guy who made that record? Good question. Garland Jeffreys' real fans hung around for decades of thoughtful, hard-hitting music. The industry lost the beat. Jeffreys was... confusing. His music was all over the place: rock, reggae, blues and more. And he was a little too New York: half African American, half Puerto Rican, born in Coney Island, a downtown migrant.Jeffreys has had a great career --- in Europe, where he's nearly as beloved as Lou Reed. The career he should have had at home starts right now, with the release of \"The King of In Between.\" (That's a double pun, first about his mixed race heritage, then about his unclassifiable music.) Of the 12 songs, six or seven are right up there with \"Wild in the Streets\" --- it's one of those records that defines the New York state of mind.One example: \"Coney Island Winter\" With lyrics that cut sharp as the wind on the Boardwalk in January. And that pounding, New York-bloodstream beat that is one of Jeffreys' signatures. And there's more. A disco song the Stones would love to have. Reggae with a lilt. A downtown confessional. A bonus track of a killer classic. Catchy stuff, and quotable --- the record speaks for itself. But after decades I wanted to hear the voice of the creator. So Garland Jeffreys and I did some phone:Jesse Kornbluth: Hey, you're in The New Yorker this week.Garland Jeffreys: It's been like 5 mentions over the course of 6 weeks.JK: Amazing. Why is this?GJ: Believe it or not, there's an attraction for what I'm doing.JK: What are you doing?GJ: What I've been doing for 40 years.JK: You mean, writing great songs and making great albums?GJ: Obviously, it starts with the writing. I was writing songs I liked --- always a big indicator. For what I do, I have to be involved with the story.  Little by little, I found my way.JK: What is the story?GJ: It has a lot of aspects. The struggles of working class people, the insane economic inequality in America, mortality, the power of music to lift us up.JK: Ah, the real stuff. Is there so much of it here because, this time, you paid to make the CD?GJ: My own company --- long overdue.JK: The difference?GJ: I don't have to answer to anybody. I want to listen to people --- but I can choose the people.JK: Thirteen years between CDs. That's impressive. Even more impressive: At a fairly advanced age, you have a 15-year-old daughter. How did that happen?GJ: If you can believe this, having a child wasn't on our radar. Then my wife Claire said, \"I'm 37 --- you want to have a kid?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" Just like that.JK: And now your 15-year-old daughter is a singer/songwriter.GJ: Savannah is a great kid. When she was in the womb, I was working on a CD. I played it to death. So she was born with music on the brain. We used to sing together on the way to preschool. Almost every morning, we'd make two loops around a statue of Peter Stuyvesant. And we'd sing a song we made up: \"I'm going to my old school...passing Peter Stuyvesant...\" When she saw people coming, she'd sing louder!JK: What have you taught her about writing and performing?GJ: We got her a piano, but I have not interfered with her at all --- I've never even shown her a chord progression. She has really come to it herself. I take my hat off to myself for keeping my mouth shut.JK: By any measure, you're incredibly vital --- what's the secret?GJ: Maybe having a child --- that definitely kicks your butt. But I think it's really that I'm an artist. I was born to do what I'm doing. Each time out, I do my best. I do projects I'm interested in, I try to shape a story, and I go through the process.  I'm pretty sure I'll be making music until it's impossible to do so.JK: Future plans?GJ: Perform this music all over the world. And then stay alive and keep making music --- I'm on the 90 year plan.Garland Jeffreys is now 68. Twenty-two years to go. If \"The King of In Between\" is any indication, he'll make it.\n", "val": 0.001980789238587022}

{"text": "I experienced two problems on my Windows XP 32bit PC.  At purchase, I asked that the mp3 be put on my amazon cloud. Then I downloaded from the cloud and experienced some issues:PROBLEM:  The name that was used was crazy long, so long that windows media player couldn't play the mp3. After I realized the length of the filename seemed to be the problem, I couldn't even rename the file in windows file explorer, just failed and reported an error.  I'm DOS savvy, so I tried the \"dir /X\" to get a short name and subsequently rename it.  That caused a catastrophic DOS error and did not rename the file.SOLUTION: Finally I went to the cloud and renamed it there to \"water\" - then downloaded again.  That resulted with a file with a reasonable name, I called it water.mp3.  But I soon realized that the folder names the Amazon download utility created had similar crazy long names as well and that was giving me issues as well with windows media player.  Luckily I was was able to use DOS to fix the directory names.

She delivers a more natural tone with her ballad very intimately, unlike more oversatured divas like Rihanna and Beyonce' have made in their songs. I was pleasantly surprised with the song from Jill. It definitely is a better ballad than what has shown to brew on radio. While everything lately on radio has been so much about Lady Gaga, what Jill has is a more natural feeling with her voice. It is a better song than what she had with Shame with Eve. If you're a huge Jill Scott fan, give Hear My Call a shot.Song: B 1/2+\n", "val": 0.04356513172388077}

{"text": "This review is not primarily focused on the remix content of this CD single, but first of all about the new format: a CD-R manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com. Due to digital downloads major record companies see their physical CD-singles sales drastically tanking the last few years. We can state with upmost certainty that the CD-single as a format by now is dead in most of the important music territories, except for the UK (and maybe for France and Germany). In that light these CD-R's on demand are becoming a commercially viable option for releasing single remixes (and out of print albums).So what's the deal here? You get an official, more or less factory burned CD-R, including a full colour disc label, and a full colour inlay. All with official art work made for this single release by Lady Gaga's record label Streamline/Interscope Records (Universal). The package is factory sealed, exactly like on a regular CD release with a glued fold on the top and bottom edge. In other words: this is an official release in 16-bit/44.1 kHz CD quality. The only difference is the CD-R media, which of course has a severely reduced lifespan to factory pressed CD's.This exclusive Amazon.com release contains the 7 remixes which are also present on the promotional only CD single and, of course, available as digital download as 'Remixes Part 1'.French DJ Guena LG makes his fourth remix for Lady Gaga. Nice remix, but nothing new here. On the other hand there is the Goldfrapp remix. The UK duo remixed the track completely into a slow-speed version that clocks in at 4:42 minutes. When you turn up the speed to 37.5 % you get a surprising shorter new version (3:37). That will be the Goldfrapp version you are gonna like to play. Try it!'Remixes Part 2' of Judas contains 2 additional remixes: the Jour version of the Mirrors Une Autre Monde Mix (in my opinion better than the Nuit version) and the Royksopp's European Imbecile Mix. These 2 mixes are not available on this release unfortunately. Great pity, especially for the latter remix. The way Royksopp remixed this track is really, really phenomenal. Probably one of the best remixes of 2011, doesn't matter whether you fancy the song or not. These Norwegian guys created a total new song, building it up to a blow-out crescendo finale. The electronised vocals, the superb different arrangement, just awesome - even when this recreation might sound more like Royksopp than Lady Gaga.\n", "val": 3.297331932117231e-05}

Also gone is much of the edginess, but it's replaced with stronger melodies, fuller sounding instrumentation, and wonderful accompaniments. Although i will admit that it seems that she doesn't showcase her powerful voice as much on this album, it still is front and center more than some of the songs.

And i really wish that more real talent, like Anna's, became popular in the mainstream music world, but i realize the fact that she's not a whore, or some showy nut job, might limit how famous she can get......BUT I DIGRESS! =PThis album is beautifully deep and soft. And while it isn't a piano-heavy album, it IS a \"soft-heavy\" album.Which is okay and all, but Anna has such a powerful voice that it was really a shame to not hear her go as powerful as she could of easily gone.Especially on some of the songs like \"Sort of Delilah\", which are very deep and obviously heartfelt songs.....it REALLY was a shame that those were so, soft.Biggest example of the soft thing for me, is the song \"Shine\"I BEG anyone who is reading this, to go download Anna's \"Shine EP\" album, and listen to the original version of this song. It is FANTASTIC!Her voice has power, and passion in it! And the beat is soft AND upbeat, also powerful in its own right.The version of \"Shine\" on this album, is pretty and soft and cutesy......and with Annas Voice, of course it's going to be a lovely tune soft or not....but when compared to the original version, it is completely BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER! And just comes off as, weak.[Now does this mean i don't like soft songs or albums? Heck no! But when an artist never reaches their known full vocal ability/power in ANY of the songs on their album, it's a bit of a let down.]So to conclude, for the lack of passion and strength in her voice that you see so clearly on \"Shine EP\" & \"Wreck of the Day\", I had to take off a star.[if i could, i would of made it a star and a half, 3.5] But i still really like this album, and i'm so stoked to have another album of Anna's in my collection!!!

It starts out with a very-twainy-sort-of begining. It's a love song, in my opinion. But with Ms. nalick, you can never know. 5/54) Walk Away: Briliant. Has the potential to get Ms. Nalick back on the charts. 5/55) Sort Of Delilah: The strings in this song...the lyrics...this is easily the greatest song on the album. It apperes that something dramatic happened, and this song is about protecting someone. 6/56) Scars: Very emotional...very powerful... 5/57) These Old Wings: A melodic start gives birth to another potentail hit, \"And what are you really holding you onto on, life is a tight rope, and your burning, burning, burning both ends.\" 4/58) Shine [2011]: A remake of the title song of her EP, Shine. It's a much softer, much more relaxed version. The same lyrics give bith to an entirly diffrent song. 5/59) The Fairest Of The Seasons: In an album of strong, strong songs, this song is stuck to the wall.

Creativity and talent is something that is hard to find nowadays but when a song doesn't need a vocalist who's screaming their lungs out and still get the point across it makes me proud to support them. ^^\n", "val": 0.014458289369940758}

{"text": "I remember listening to Suzy Bogguss cassettes back in the waning years of the last century...OK, that's too dramatic, but she was such an awesome force to be reckoned with in Nashville in the '90's.  Her voice was so pure and sweet, and I melted each time her songs came up on the rotation on Nashville's legendary FM country stations.  I lost track of Suzy for some time, but as I was strolling through the digital stacks of Amazon, I came across this recent release, and I just had to explore it.  I love it.  It takes me back to my grade school music classes that gave me such a deep appreciation for American folk music.  Several of the tracks on this album were staple selections in school.  (Ms. Bogguss sure does them more justice than a gaggle of unruly 5th graders.)  Overall, this is an excellent selection of songs, supported by a very capable acoustic band.  It's obvious that she developed the project as a labor of love--it's far above the cookie-cutter, commercial throw-away songs that populate the top forty these days.  But that makes it doubly impressive: she puts the same heart and soul into these legendary American tunes that she did during her tenure at the top of the charts.  If she hasn't already done it, this is prime material for a PBS special.  If you love traditional folk performed with a lot of tender loving care, this album is highly recommended.  Savor every note, and don't worry if you find yourself singing along.  These songs were made for singing.\n", "val": 0.037983689457178116}
{"text": "These are songs I remember from my brothers' entry-level guitar songbooks back in the early 1970s. Suzy's CD has the same effect as their strumming always did: You want to join in and sing along.  Bogguss has never been a diva-type vocalist (the type who apparently views every song as little more than a trampoline for his/her allegedly \"soulful\" histrionics). She sticks to the melody, she enunciates each word clearly, and she wraps herself in the persona behind the lyrics rather than changing the songs to suit her. All of these qualities make her an ideal artist for a project like AFS.  For these readings, I'm very grateful that she selected \"Shenandoah\" in particular. I've always felt it is a gorgeous song, but never -- even after decades of searching -- found a recorded version that does it justice. Many artists have covered it (from the Kingston Trio to Bruce Springsteen) but again, only Suzy respects the melody enough to let its beauty shine.  I would not have picked \"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\" as a good vehicle for her soprano, but she surprised me. It's effective, largely because of her phrasing and especially her emphasis on the long \"O\" sound in \"home\". Again: She lets the song dictate where her voice should go.  Yes, I have a few minor criticisms. First, while the stripped-bare arrangements are generally successful, I would have liked a little more production. Some strings on \"Shenandoah\", for example, and maybe more pronounced use of background singers overall. I doubt this would have detracted from the \"honesty\" of the recording.  Second, the packaging -- though lovely and fitting to the concept -- resurrects a photo from the 2007 \"Sweet Danger\" sessions and lists the track sequence incorrectly.  AFS definitely isn't the Bogguss of \"Drive South\" or \"Hey Cinderella\", but does recall some of the better moments on her debut album (\"Somewhere Between\"). Bogguss fans will certainly admire her vocals, and I defy anyone to get through the entire disk without at some point singing along.\n", "val": 0.009086539968848228}

I can imagine Suzy as Sweet Betsy.  Her expressive artistry makes me care about every character in that song.  Suzy brings them all vividly to life.When Suzy heard Garrison Keillor leading his audience in singing old-time favorite songs such as these, that was joy to her and that was her inspiration.  Suzy Bogguss is not just singing these folk songs to us.  With her new album and her new songbook she is leading us in the singing.

As a fan since childhood, I was blown away-no pun intended-when I first heard this album. It was the summer I graduated high school, and from the moment I first heard the song \"Route 101\" on the radio, I knew right away which album would be the next to join my collection!The album is divided roughly into two sections: side one is the ballad collection and side two steps it up a few notches with six of the most upbeat, rhythmic songs Herb has ever committed to wax. His trumpet seems to take on a life of it's own, and has the ability to transport the listener to a special time in his life. Anyone who thinks instrumental music can't convey a message or feeling must listen to this album! Alpert is a master of his instrument, which he so obviously loves. It's no wonder \"Route 101\" was a top forty hit.Herb Alpert is now seventy-five years old and still recording. He's been there for me all my life, taking me to places I've never been, and in turn, allowing me show my true feelings without fear.

{"text": "Ok, I'm a huge Spider-Man fan.  However, U2 is rather so-so to me.  I do like some of U2's songs, but I in no way think they are one of the greatest bands ever.  And that is where I think this musical gets it's problems from.  Perhaps seeing the production live would help one appreciate the music more (or being a huge U2 fan).  But a lot of folks don't have that luxury.  The album on it's own is rather mediocre.  Big props to the Edge and his chops of some songs like the intro, NY Debut.  Some of the songs though, ie Bouncing Off the Walls, are just a jumbled mess that has very little cohesiveness.  Another thing I don't quite understand is the need to make Reeve Carney (Peter Parker/Spiderman)immitate Bono so much.  With the stressed vocals and all the Yeah-Yeah-Yeah's, they might have well just put Bono himself in the spandex.  Not all is lost though. Patrick Page as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin brings a much needed flair and will make your spider sense tingle.  His songs \"Pull the Trigger\" and \"A Freak Like Me Needs Company\"  are pretty catchy, fun, and are more of what I would expect from a MUSICAL of SPIDERMAN.  If it weren't for these songs, I'd consider the soundtrack a failed radioactive experiment.  Overall, a ho-hum album with just a couple of glimmering rays of hope.  I hereby give this 3 out of 5 web shooters.\n", "val": 0.0001816036965465173}

The show itself is a different story - there's some good stuff in it, but there's a lot of stuff wrong with it.

{"text": "So \"Spider Man: Turn off the Dark\" has finally opened after a tumultuous preview period and endless tinkering. Finally, those of us curious enough to see what all the fuss is about at least have a chance to hear what appears to be the highlights of the score by U2's Bono and The Edge.First off, it's a little hard to tell what to expect from the album cover, which labels the album \"Songs from\" instead of \"Original Broadway Cast Recording.\" This recording, though, documents the performances of stars Reeve Carney, Jennifer Damiano, and Patrick Page, so for all intents and purposes, I'd say this is indeed the Original Cast Recording. If that wasn't confusing enough, it took me a couple of disjointed listens to realize the songs are not in show order! So I researched the song list as it appears in the show and made my own playlist--I would advise others to do the same. It really has made it more comprehensible.  I'm really not sure what the producers were thinking, mixing everything up. It's just going to make people think the show's exactly the mess it has the reputation for being.With the songs in order, the plot comes across pretty easily--this doesn't seem to be as \"inept\" a score as some critics have suggested.  It's pretty simple to follow (especially as it's basically the Spider-Man origin story, with the Green Goblin as the show's villain, just like the first Spider-Man movie). I like the atmospheric style of the songs--a rock approach is the right one for a comic book show. Still, it's a mixed bag. The traditional rock songs \"Rise Above 1\" and \"Boy Falls from the Sky\" are the standouts, with Carney's adept rocker voice helping them soar. \"No More\" with Damiano, along with the ballads \"I Just Can't Walk Away (Say It Now),\" and\" If the World Should End\" also strike the right emotional notes. On the other hand, there are couple underwritten songs for The Green Goblin that should have been scrapped or reworked.It may not sound like high praise, but for Broadway newbies, the score comes across fairly well on disc. Is it excellent? No. But it's an enjoyable listen, with some standout tracks, and I certainly can think of far worse scores, even by theater mainstays. In other words, I do hope pop-rock musicians will continue to venture into the world of musical theater and give it a whirl. There's a freshness here that I appreciate, even if it's not a complete success.\n", "val": 0.0007372081163339317}
{"text": "'Spider-man : Turn Off The Dark's CD release by Broadway musical cast is composed under the direction of Bono & The Edge (U2 frontman/singer-songwriter & guitarist respectively). It's produced by legendary Steve Lillywhite. This CD (14 tracks) has some highs & lows despite what one could call 'heavyweight production' (Bono, The Edge & the legendary rock producer Steve Lillywhite). There is a great U2 sound in \"NY Debut(Instrumental)\" (great guitar & orchestral sound. The first part of the song is reminiscent of U2's \"Pride(In The Name Of Love)\" sound), \"Boy Falls From The Sky\" (great guitar, featuring Reeve Carney) & \"Picture This\" (great melody & vocals by Bono). Stand-out track is \"Turn Off The Dark\" : well fitting closing title track, wonderful jazz piano & melody featuring T.V.Carpio. Great tracks include \"Rise Above 1\" (melody & vocals featuring Reeve Carney), \"I Just Can't Walk Away(Say It Now)\" (great music & vocals featuring Reeve Carney), \"No More\", \"DIY World\" (great harmonies on this 'cabaret' song featuring Patrick Page), \"If The World Should End\" (jazz track with great violin/piano/guitar combination featuring Jennifer Damiano) & \"A Freak Like Me Need Company\". Okay tracks include \"Bouncing Off The Walls\", \"Pull The Trigger\" (indie track with some 'rapping' vocals featuring Patrick Page), \"Sinistereo\" (featuring The Edge) & \"Rise Above 2\". I'm a U2 fan, my expectation may have been very high for this CD. Writing songs for Broadway can be challenging at several levels especially trying to fit into the theme as well as the specific part/s. And one can appreciate the music more after watching the Broadway musical (was launched yesterday despite some controversies including the firing of a director). On overall, this is a good CD release (but not great or fantastic) from Broaday musical 'Spider-man : Turn Off The Dark', a recommended CD listening & a must for Spider-man & U2 fans.\n", "val": 0.017624983564019203}

{"text": "Firstly this is not your typical Broadway cast soundtrack CD, like everything else about Spider Man - Turn off the dark Broadway play, it is not typical. The CD comprises of 14 songs from the stage play, selected in random order, mostly sung by the cast members and some with Bono and Edge of U2 who wrote all the songs and produced the play.While most reviews are complaining about the songs not being in the order that they appeared in the show, or whether Bono and Edge should be singing on the CD since they are not appearing in the play and that all the songs sound like U2 or that the songs  are too pop.Despite all these arguments, everyone has lost sight that this is a collection of some very good pop rock music that could stand by itself.Secondly, Bono and Edge have done a very good job of creating songs for this play, it is centred around music that was specially written for the show, unlike other pop rock musical plays of the day, where already existing songs are taken and written into the play  eg Mama Mia, Jersey Boys etc.Bono and Edge started from scratch and penned these song as a backdrop to the familiar story of Spider Man. Although the songs tell the story of the show, each song stands on its own. Stand out tracks include, (in random order) If the world should end, Rise above 1, A freak like me needs company, I just can't walk away (say it now). I am sure in time some of these song will become Broadway favourites.There are sentimental ballads and some up tempo songs  that are used to capture the world of Peter Parker, Mary Jane and the Green Goblin.I would recommend buying the CD first, before seeing the show and let the order of the songs as they appear in the play surprise you.

{"text": "The live stage was once the source of a majority of America's pop music and it could be again one day. It is in everybody's best interest for us to encourage pop artists who are interested in reaching a broader audience and in more complex story telling to collaborate in full stage musicals. Bono and The Edge clearly have the innate talent to crack this demanding medium and while their initial stage adventure did not work out (between personality clashes, cost over-runs, absences to tour and disastrous accidents which stole the focus from the actual story they were attempting to tell, it would be foolish to place praise or blame no matter how may tickets tourists can be suckered into buying to see the wreckage). Even the great Duke Ellington never learned that the theatre is a *collaborative* art where you cannot simply write your score and walk away. He never had a hit in his lifetime. We can only hope that Bono and the Edge learn from SPIDER-MAN and do better during theirs.What WE are examining HERE however is the Broadway Cast Album of SPIDER-MAN - TURN OFF THE DARK The Musical AS A RECORDING, not the musical itself, although there is some necessary overlap. The score is not without its moments of pleasing melody, emotion and thoughtful lyric ideas. The Song \"Rise Above\" is not well supported in the book, but stands out as a song many fans will want to hear again. \"If The World Should End\" and \"The Myth of Arachne\" each also have real potential, but only the former is actually on the \"Cast Album.\" This leads us to the real problem with the CD - IS it a Cast Album or a mere Rock Compilation *companion* album to the show? The CD makes little attempt to recreate even the minimal theatrical values of the failed stage show - six of the most theatrical numbers in the show aren't even ON the album, those that ARE are not in show order (to hear the versions of the score that are, or were when the producers finally said the show was ready to \"Open\" months after it had already been reviewed last season - still not in their original stage renditions - you must play the tracks in the following order: 8,9,6,3,13,7,4,12,10,11,14,5 and 2). Since the CD does not document the show in performance at any stage in its development (the authors join the \"Original Cast\" in four of the numbers - NOT in \"demo tracks\" the way the liner notes say - although this does not hurt their performance at all), it is understandable that there is no Plot Synopsis to indicate how the music is actually USED in the show (the current plot, as butchered from Director Julie Taymor's original overly complex conceit beggars rational description in any case), but the notes don't bear much relationship to that is on the CD itself!If a potential listener is an unquestioning fan of even lesser work from Bono or The Edge or a Broadway \"completist\" who collects every Broadway show recording from OKLAHOMA! to the latest Wildhorn, they will obviously have to have this CD, but if they are someone who merely is curious to hear what this show was like on Broadway without actually seeing the sub-Cirque du Soleil flying and blow-up plastic doll \"monsters,\" this CD won't help a lot. Those of us who actually like good rock music will wish Bono et al better luck next time...and hope there IS a next time.

Don't get me wrong, it's got some bad numbers on it, but if you approach it as a sort of \"'inspired by Spider-Man\" album then you'll be okay.

{"text": "I must preface this review that I have never watched the Broadway production.As someone who really enjoys Broadway music and loves U2, this album definitely missed the mark.First of all, the lyrics are totally banal. To quote: \"You don't have to fly too high to get too close to the sun, See the boy fall from the sky.\" Yeah. It's that bad. Not only is it extremely cliched, the lyrics provide little to no context with relation to the story elements. First and foremost, a musical must convey a story. Obviously this is completely lacking in the songbook. Add a muddled articulation of the lyrics by the actors, this leads to complete incomprehension for listeners.Verses tend to be overly long which meant boring repeating melodic patterns. The tone of the music is too similar throughout the book and doesn't appropriately convey a message to the audience.To complete a picture: imagine extremely obtuse, cliched verses that last way too long for comfort. Add stagnating melodies that tonally sound very similar, it's not hard to understand why this musical was forever in previews and reviewed poorly. I pity the poor director who got fired from this production. With a book like this, it was doomed to fail from the get go.The actors themselves did not infuse personality in their performances. Although note for note, they are probably correct - the emotional quality you look for in a performance is completely lost. For example, \"Bouncing off the Walls\" lack any sort of excitement of being able to climb walls at a whim. I could go on and on but then I would be no better than the lyricist for this album.One positive though. The song that stood out on the album was the highly produced rock version of Rise Above (Rise Above 1). Bono's distinctive vocals and proper annunciation made for a much better lead than Mr. Carney's (who was appropriately relegated to a whiny/milksop chorus vocals.) Which proves you can be a great rock musician but have no clue about writing a good book for a Broadway show.\n", "val": 2.1675532480003312e-05}

{"text": "'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' is one of the oddest things ever. Who could've thought that Spider-Man would make a good Broadway musical? With that said, what they ultimately came up with is pretty enjoyable, in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. I'm glad to own at least a good chunk of the songs on CD (a couple seem to have been left out but whatever).The first track, 'NY Debut,' is the only purely instrumental piece on the disc. Everything else is sung by the cast. 'Boy Falls from the Sky' is uplifting sounding but kind of generic. Sam with 'Rise Above 1.' Uplifting but unremarkable. Its successor, 'Rise Above 2,' is sadder, which pretty accurately describes the majority of the tracks on this disc. With a couple of sappy love songs and three really great songs about the villain, most of the songs from the musical are just big angst-filled whine-fests. Peter Parker is one severely depressed guy.The three genuinely entertaining and good tracks are of course the ones pertaining to the villains. First up is 'Pull the Trigger,' which has Norman Osborn being pressured by the military. Unlike Peter, Norman manages to sing about his personal problems here without angsting too much and the song is a real foot-tapper with some ironic commentary about the current way the US military approaches things.This is followed by the less remarkable but still fun 'DIY World,' wherein Norman and his colleagues, mad with power, sing about how they can become immortal using their mad science. And this brings us to the real crown jewel in this soundtrack, 'A Freak Like Me Needs Company,' wherein Norman, mutated into the Green Goblin, sings of his woes before deciding he loves his new form and wants the whole world to know it. Patrick Page sure sounds like he's having a blast with this number and it's definitely the most unique song on the disc.The title track, 'Turn Off the Dark,' closes out the disc with a bit of a whimper after the rousing 'Freak Like Me.' The remainder of the songs are bit forgettable, but the three sung by Patrick Page and co. are worth buying the CD all by themselves.\n", "val": 0.007692885585129261}

It would have been so much better to cut out the studio tricks to make a song good (A song that fades out?? Not done on Broadway). Hopefully, there will be an Original Cast Broadway Recording with all the song and in their proper order. And to all those that say this CD sounds like a U2 album, you're correct. In fact, the way some of the songs are presented, they don't sound like Broadway show tunes. Funny thing is, they do sound like show tunes when listened to live.

{"text": "NOTE: My review contains a few very minor spoilers for the Broadway show. I believe they're extremely minor but proceed at your own risk.When I first listened to the CD I really didn't know what to think. I liked some of the songs but overall it seemed disjointed and a little off. After doing a little reading (both online and the liner notes), I found that the songs aren't in the order that they are in the show, that \"Picture This\" is a demo version (explaining why Bono is singing in it), and the inappropriately named \"Rise Above 1\" is actually not part of the show and is an album/single/concert version of the song featuring Bono doing the majority of the singing. After finding this out and giving the album another listen, I found I enjoyed it a whole lot more, in fact, I was getting to where I loved it. It's got a nice mix of songs including some very nice rock riffs and some slower tunes to give it a nice balance.I just got back from my first trip to NYC and decided to make my first Broadway experience to be this show and I was not let down. The show was awesome and I recommend you go see it if you're in NYC. In regards to this review, seeing the show made me love the album more. Having a better sense of where the songs fit in regards to the story makes it a lot more enjoyable as some songs reference events that happened earlier and reflect emotions that have been building over the course of the show (ex: The Boy Falls From the Sky is Peter's solo number that he sings right before his climatic battle with the Goblin and is the culmination of everything he's been going through over the course of the show and has no reason to be at the beginning of the CD). I have just rearranged the tracks to story-order so we'll see how that affects the overall play of the album.The only reason I have given the album 4 stars versus 5 is the odd arrangement of the songs and the fact that this is not a complete version of the show. Several songs are missing as well as the majority of the score. I think the majority of the songs were left out were because they seem more at home in a musical and not on a rock album. I'd really like to hear \"Bullying by Numbers\" again which seems very at home in a musical and added to the eclectic mix of music styles that while some people might not like, I did. Also, \"Venom\" (having nothing to do with the character) and \"Sinistereo\" are companion pieces (I don't think you could consider \"Sinistereo\" a reprise, they're different songs that share the same music, though there are a few short reprises of songs in the show) and I guess they didn't see the reason to put both on the album. I really, really wish this featured the complete score. The score was very exciting and was one of my favorite parts of seeing the show. Bono mentions they had several cues of the score to choose from and put only this lonely one on the album. Granted, it's a great choice. \"NY Debut\" is very pulse-pounding and rock-ish and I have listened to it several times over. In the show, it plays, obviously, during Spidey's debut in his costume and in New York serving as the change over point in the show where the Spidey stunts kick in. If you've seen the show, it's this track that will make you remember seeing Spidey swing through the skies. From what I remember, it also serves as the majority of the Overture but not completely. I seem to remember an instrumental version of \"Rise Above\" interwoven into it for the Overture. There was an instrumental version of \"D.I.Y. World\" that played during the final battle with Gobby that was very exciting and that I wish were on this album.If you do see the show, you should also know that some of the lyrics have changed since they finalized this album. Minor changes mostly but it was a little jarring while I was watching the show because I had listened to this CD so many times. Also, the songs on the album have been arranged so as to eliminate any of the stops in the song that included dialogue and so we're really getting album edits of the majority of the songs. The one that I remember the most changes to is \"A Freak Like Me Needs Company.\" During the actual show, there are many 'breaks' in the song, although the music continues, to allow the Goblin to explain his plan and introduce the Sinister Six to the audience.Overall, I love this album and I loved the show immensely. I just hope that they decide to release a 2-disc complete cast recording of this show that also includes the complete score and any updated lyrics. I can pretty much predict that I would give that release 5-stars.\n", "val": 0.0009759456734173}
{"text": "I wasn't expecting much when I popped this into my CD player, based on previous reviews, so my first impression of this show was actually pretty good.  I like U2, so I was not turned off by the U2 sound of many of the tracks, and there were actually a couple surprises and some songs that I liked.  I am a musical theatre collector and strive to collect every cast album available.  Most get better after multiple listenings.  Spider-Man, however, does not.  The music itself is decent, sometimes repetitive and mind-numbing, but some pleasant melodies are there, too.  The lyrics leave much to be desired.  There is a definite pattern of repeating lyrics on almost all the songs. For example, Rise Above repeats \"Believe\" like 7 times at the end, and half of the songs do the exact same thing.  Bouncing off the Walls was horrible, the chorus of the song is just repeating \"Bouncing off the walls\" over and over again.  These patterns become all the more jarring when you listen to the album more than once.Vocally, the cast sounds great, with the exception of Peter Parker, played by Reeve Carney. Have any of the creators actually read a Spider-Man comic?  This man is NOT Peter Parker, nor is he Spider-Man. He sounds more like a rock singer, but in a musical it just comes across as whiney.  If you think he's got a cool rocker voice, then, again, that's not Peter Parker either.  The clips I've seen of Reeve Carney show him singing with his mouth barely open.  It shows.I also felt that the music itself did not stay with the spirit of Spider-Man comics.  Spider-Man is mostly known for his wit and jabbing comments, for cracking jokes even in extremely strenuous circumstances.  I'm not asking for much - it's a musical.  But I'd like to see at least a hint of it.  Maybe they came through in the dialogue.  Maybe it's in some of the tracks not presented here.  I really hope they didn't spend 75 million on a show and get the main character wrong.Lastly, I am disappointed by how many songs are missing from this album, and the fact that the songs are presented out of order from the actual show.  I wouldn't mind if this CD had bonus tracks, with songs recorded by Bono and the Edge.  But I object to replacing cast members with these artists.  Present the song as it is in the show.  If you want to include U2, include it as a bonus track.  But, like I said, I'm a musical theatre fan.  It appears this album was more designed for U2 fans, and as such is presented more like a rock album and not like a true Cast Recording.Here's the song listing as I know it.  *indicates song is missing from this recordingNY DebutThe Myth of Arachne *Behold and Wonder *Bullying by Numbers * (the most glaring omission)No MoreDIY WorldVenom *Bouncing Off the WallsRise AbovePull the TriggerPicture ThisA Freak Like Me Needs CompanyIf the World Should End *SinistereoSpider-Man! *Turn Off the DarkI Just Can't Walk AwayIf the World Should End (Reprise)The Boy Falls From the Sky *I'll Take Manhattan *A New Dawn (Finale) *\n", "val": 0.0001156934376922436}

{"text": "This soundtrack is unique for Broadway,not because it is composed by 2 of the members of U2...in fact much of the music on this soundtrack doesn't sound like U2. The music for this Broadway production is mostly dark and brooding that occasionally soars but is mostly melodic minor chord music that stands in stark contrast to the stereotypical song and dance big number productions that permeates Broadway.The reason why the music/show has gotten panned in some circles can be attributed to three things: 1.) Broadway theater snobs - as mentioned above most of them are offended by a show/soundtrack that doesn't sound like the typical Broadway fare they are used to seeing. Critics mostly fall into this category.2.) Comic Book geeks - those hardcore comic/Spiderman fans who can't live with the words  \"Spiderman\" and \"musical\" in the same sentence...they are snobs at the other end of the spectrum from the Broadway theater snobs...they are all convinced this show has a singing Spiderman in it....for the record it does not...believe it or not this show is not corny.3.) The anti -U2 contingent - the world's biggest band may have a lot of fans out there however they have just as many detractors...people who hate them and love to see noithing more than failure at whatever project they may be involved in.The bottom line is the music from this soundtrack like the show itself is very good...it isn't a masterpiece but then again very little music is these days...give it a chance and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.003890638705343008}

Unfortunately, this Bono produced CD does nothing to stimulate or excite a possible theater goer and in fact reinforces the many claims that the shows greatest flaw is the banality and mediocrity of the score. The music comes off as overly produced, overly bland and simply lackluster. Broadway cast albums are often recorded in two or three days, giving a not perfect, yet almost uncut version of the music. You can hear performers gasping for breath after a long note. Some cut offs are a bit ragged, but that reinforces the \"live\" aspect of theater. This recording has tried to hard to make everything perfect and as a result it is simply listless and lifeless; a vanity piece for Bono. And, yes, many of the melodies are mind numbingly dull.

First, it isn't music and second, this song doesn't sound anything like the Dr. Pepper or Bud Light commercial songs that Pitbull has out right now. I do admire that Pitbull is following the crowd in making music with autotune beats, stupid lyrics about partying and plastering himself everywhere.Asschowder was playing a gig at Ted's House of Pants in west Tennessee a couple weeks ago to try out some of our new material for our upcoming album which will be even better than noise 4(I know that is hard to believe). When we came off stage, we were surprised to see pitbull backstage holding a Dr. Pepper in one hand and a bud light in the other. He had a NASCAR jacket on that had patches for everything he is putting his face on at this point. I looked at him and said, \"Speak\". Pitbull blew our mind at that point and said,Let's have a real good time, let's have a real good timeLet's have a real good time, let's have a real good timeLet's have a real good time, let's have a real good timeLet's have a real good time, let's have a real good timeI told him that we understood and we were currently having a good time. I also told him ther was no need to wear a suit and sunglasses everywhere he went. I also told him I was disappointed he featured another artist on only 10 of the 12 tracks on his newest album instead of featuring someone else on every track like hip hop artists were supposed to do. I think he understood he was staring in the face of musical genius. J-abs played a riff on the leadbass that made him cry.

The three a$$ clowns who did this song: Pitbull, Neyo, and Afrojack have little or no talent. The lion's share of the blame for this travesty of a song goes to Afrojack, who is responsible for the whack a$$ production and music, then second most annoying, is Neyo's whining. Although Pitbull is culpable of being involved in a lot of bad (as in terrible) music lately, the final nails in the coffin is the generic/bland production/instrumentation/arrangements.\n", "val": 9.393274012836628e-06}

I haven't decided if it's BETTER than Dreaming Out Loud, but it was definitely worth the wait. It was a smart move to make \"All The Right Moves\" and \"Good Life\" their first two singles from this album, as they are probably the best songs on it. However, the beginning of every other song on the album automatically pulls you in; the songs are captivating. The instrumental arrangements are excellent, and it's nice to listen to lyrics that have meaning. Ryan Tedder's vocals are top-notch. Recommended song: \"Marchin' On\".*I only write reviews if I am absolutely in love with a product; this album is worth writing a review for.\n", "val": 0.03636484593153}

Why are you installing software on my machine??? at all???? it's so you can market to me in new and amazing ways. it's so shady and transparent. don't be that company, amazon. you were doing it right.\n", "val": 1.9781737137236632e-05}
{"text": "I ordered this CD at the last moment before Christmas.  My wife expressed an interest in the group when they were on The Voice.  I downloaded my order soon thereafter for this and the group's latest CD.  I listened quickly of their sample cuts and liked them.  But, when put on the surround sound, their music fluctuated between soft rock songs and more aggressive rock songs.  I liked this album but my wife wasn't to thrilled by all their tracks.  Accordingly, I rate it as a 4 stars album.  I would let friends listen to the entire album to see if they liked it rather than a straight \"you have to get this.\"  Good but could be better for a middle aged music lover.  A definite 4.  However, their latest CD: Native, really hits the great album rank.\n", "val": 0.004949919413775206}

They remind me a little bit of the Fray whom I consider myself a fan of. I listened to the samples and decided to go ahead and download the entire album.

I love the somber and melancholy styles of \"Fear\" The energy I get from the title track and \"made for you\" and \"Marching on\".Initially I thought I would buy the album and like it then transfer Good Life to the mix I walk to and be done with it but I was SO wrong.

{"text": "One Republic's \"Waking Up\" contains an emotionally driven set of songs from track one to eleven plus one (the Amazon Exclusive Version contains a cover of Duffy's \"Mercy\").  The album does not skip a beat with its energetic instrumentation of pulsating rhythms that breathes into the band's initial sound as well as a tinge of influences that are undeniable from The Beatles, U2, and Coldplay.  All of the tracks are deeply intimate and intense that has a somewhat subtle theme of treading on.The opening track \"Made For You\" contains a thumping intro and inter-play of Ryan Tredder's signature vocals and the string and chorale arrangements a la the Rolling Stones' \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" which is identifiable and perfectly flows into the next track \"All The Right Moves.\"  \"Moves\" along with the other singles off the album \"Secrets\" and \"Good Life\" possess a powerful musical executions and memorable choruses that pound with much exuberance from beginning to end.  The band slows the tempo with the following tracks that sound very much like Coldplay and U2 \"Fear\" and the title track \"Waking Up.\"  But beyond the comparisons, the piano ballad \"All this Time\" is simply unforgettable.In essence, \"Waking Up\" is an album worth listening to and adding to one's play list.  With its revolving theme of longing and waiting and marching to a beat of one's own, there is sure to be several favorite songs that may prompt the listener to replay with the volume set louder than usual.\n", "val": 0.029232783243060112}

Each song is filled with genuine emotion; each song is filled with memories of a relatable past. Each song stirs feelings of \"almost-memories\" for me, reminding me of something powerful I felt long ago, but can't quite remember.One Republic is truly talented, utilizing an amazing balance to bring forth beautiful harmony. Aside from incredibly deep lyrics, their cellist makes a huge difference. Playing a string instrument with a humanistic range, the cellist almost seems to play my own heart's strings, pulling me into the song's emotional setting regardless of the mood I am in. Furthermore, each member of the band is extremely creative and gifted. Many play unique instruments, creating unparalleled music unlike anything you have ever heard.

From the lyrics which are a bit oppositional to the \"man\" to the long intros and some tracks that are obvious non-hits, it's refreshing to hear a band on a major label attempt to have some kind of creative integrity. That being said, only about 1/2 of these songs are truly interesting. Some sound to me like they have listened to a Radiohead CD, gotten drunk, and headed to their rehearsal space and into the studio the next day. Like, the sonic textures are captured well, but the songwriting is lacking. I can't fault a band for being into experimentation, but some of the songs seem a bit loose and direction-less. I give it three stars because the songs that are really good songs are done well, and they're catchy and sincere sounding. The others sound like they need a producer or a few more days in the rehearsal studio.\n", "val": 0.002013681922107935}

{"text": "This is a very unusual album, due mostly, I believe, to the talents of Ryan Tedder, who is responsible for the vocals and the bulk of the writing, producing and arranging, as well as playing piano and other instruments. The result is an album that has solid beats and bright, structured production to ensure pop success, but also features diverse, sometimes complex arrangements, with many of the tracks including melodic piano and strings combined with heavy percussion. This is important because it gives the album a quality which makes it a cut above the ordinary pop album, a sound which is, at times, almost symphonic.For example, the first track, \"Made For You\", begins with soft drums and piano, then the vocals come in backed by heavier percussion, then later there is an interlude of only vocals and strings, then there is chanting of \"All the right friends in all the right places\", which are actually lyrics from the second track, which opens with a choir singing those lyrics. Got that? \"Missing Persons 1 & 2\" is, as the title suggests, actually 2 songs, connected by a short bridge of electronic sound. \"Waking Up\" begins with a vocal backed by a church-organ sound, then quickly turns harder, featuring chiming guitar reminiscent of U2. If fact, this track reminds me of U2's \"Joshua Tree\" period, except that it changes again at the end to a peaceful instrumental of piano and strings.  \"Marchin On\" does indeed have the beat and rousing quality of a march, but even this track contains a softer interlude.And there's more. \"Good Life\" is a very positive, happy song which has as its background an 80's-90's synthesizer sound; this is what attracted me to the album in the first place. \"Everybody Loves Me\" (another of my favorites) is a rock track with bluesy guitar and a sort of \"talking\" vocal. Ryan really frees his soul on this one! \"Fear\" is a beautiful ballad introduced by stacatto strings, then piano. \"Lullaby\" really does sound like a lullaby - hypnotic, comforting. In general, the lyrics are personal enough to relate to but abstract enough to appeal to the general pop audience. Ryan Tedder's voice is high-pitched and goes frequently into falsetto, which fits the arrangements and material. A deep voice would not enhance the aura of musicality and vague spirituality that is part of the album's charm.Even more amazing is the fact that all this creative diversity is contained in an album that is slightly under 48 minutes long. That is remarkable in itself, but it  makes me wonder what Mr. Tedder could accomplish if he set out to write an opera or perhaps a standard full-length symphony.\n", "val": 0.01703173853456974}

I'm happy to say that they did!Everybody Loves Me: Makes a good ego boost. It has a bit of a rockish feel, and just makes you feel good to sing to.Missing Persons 1 and 2: I have to admit I didn't think I'd like this one at first listen. It did grow on me though, but I don't listen to it as much as the others.Fear:I could hear the slight \"fear\" as soon as the song started. The entire arrangement was executed beautifully.Marchin On: Has a great, steady beat. Always makes me want to go a little father, a little longer, when I'm outside running.Mercy: I was expecting a different song by the same name by them, but instead thought \"This sounds a lot like that Duffy song..\" As soon as I realized it was the other song I couldn't help but smile! It made my whole day.I hardly ever buy entire albums, but this was a brilliant exception. Been listening to it nonstop since I bought it.

{"text": "One Republic's \"Waking Up\" was a refreshing surprise. Brilliantly written modern urban-rock songs that demonstrate rock is not going to die quietly. In fact, I believe One Republic has set the standard to how modern rock should be played today.  Each song brings an interesting concept to the listener; with enough twists and diversity that balances the musical hooks just enough to keep the CD on the art-rock side of the equation rather than candy-pop.The song tracks blend into each other, very much like a concept album; but, there is an inconsistent sound production throughout the CD.  Not as bad as Brian Eno's miserable production qualities (IMO) heard on Coldplay or U2.  In those recordings, the vocals are buried into the music.  One Republic's singer, Ryan Tedder, can be clearly heard.The first time I heard \"Good Life\" was on \"The Voice,\" when Tedder sang it with contestant Beverly McClellan and I loved the song along with their performance.  Another side note, Ryan Tedder co-wrote two great songs on Adele's 21 CD (Rumour Has It and Turning Tables).  He is a superb songwriter.\n", "val": 0.011548378504812717}
{"text": "This album fell into my \"heard five songs from it on Pandora, gave them all a thumbs up, so I must buy\" requirement.  I love artists whose music is so complex and interesting, that all the songs sound different.  Not just 11 or 12 that all sound the same. The only song I don't like is \"Mercy\"-and that's only because Amy Duffy totally nailed that song and made it her own.  I have no idea who wrote it or how old it is (forgive my musical ignorance) but she was born to sing that song.Anyhoo--the more I listen to this album, the more I love it.  Hearing something new each time.\n", "val": 0.0007791353855282068}
{"text": "For their second album, OneRepublic mastermind Ryan Tedder must have woken up and decided if a lot of production was terrific, than over-production would be fabulous. As a songwriter to the stars (he counts Adele and Beyonce for resume points), he certainly knows his way around songwriting and hooks. But for a writer with so many soul and R'n'B artists on his Rolodex, when it comes to his own material, Tedder aims squarely at the rafters of the world's arenas, with a jealous eye towards the likes of Muse.Take \"All The Right Moves.\" The first song on the disc may be \"Made For You,\" but that song ends with a children's choir that sings the \"All The Right Moves\" anthemic chorus just before the bombastic percussion for the song itself bursts in. Strings swell as Tedder arcs his voice for a final soaring falsetto on the chorus' catchy hook. same with \"Secrets,\" where Tedder takes a page from his mentor Timbaland and mixes rap verses with a high flying chorus and more strings. Or the closer, \"Lullaby.\" Every bit as sedate as the title suggests, it's also twice as earnest as it probably needs to be. \"Waking Up\" contains bombast, but it's a good kind of bombast.Problem is, after awhile, you wish he'd just pull in the reins a little. The title track is such an obvious U2 clone that you wonder if Tedder stole it from an early draft of \"Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark.\" The militaristic drumming of \"Marching On\" is overkill, even if the left, left, left right left hook is unshakable. The hooks throughout \"Waking Up\" are the calling card; they show exactly why Tedder has become such a go-to guy for the stars. Even my favorite song here, \"Everybody Loves Me,\" strikes the perfect balance of snappy beats and earworm. Maroon 5 or Justin Timberlake would probably kill to get their teeth into it.Unfortunately, and why this album ultimately gets an average rating from me, I don't hear an identity on \"Waking Up.\" If Ryan Tedder wants to jump ahead of the likes of The Fray and become the equal to Maroon 5's Adam Levine (or genre champ Chris Martin of Coldplay), he's going to have to prove he's got more in him than ace writing chops. OneRepublic has the ambition, Tedder obviously knows both the writing and production craft, now it's to be determined if he can become in individual above the skill sets.\n", "val": 0.0001194904325529933}

{"text": "OneRepublic hit it big when their song Apologize became the biggest song of the year; the track still gets prominent airplay even today, four years later. No followup single ignited quite the way that one did, with Stop and Stare being the only real success on Billboard. This time around, the band doesn't even try to replicate Apologize, which is a good thing. The beats are a bit harder and deeper, but not altogether dissimilar to Dreaming Out Loud. What results is an album that peaks high and doesn't so much dip low as just fade into facelessness.Made For You: The opening track is solid, though not all that memorable. The hook is catchy, but the added outro is unnecessary and doesn't add much. C+All The Right Moves: The lead single sounds like nothing from Dreaming Out Loud, making it a great song to introduce this album. The vocals are urgent and the beat is great, but it's not particularly epic. BSecrets: The second single, and the best song on the album. The subtle beginning sparks and then ignites with the chorus, which is as catchy as anything OneRepublic has ever released. This should've been more successful. B+Everybody Loves Me: A very odd song for this band to record, but very welcome. The beat is different, focusing on more percussion, and the whole thing is just fun with the ego in overdrive. A-Missing Persons 1 & 2: Just as some momentum was forming, this stops the hooks dead. This isn't a bad song, but there's absolutely nothing exciting about it. C-Good Life: A great song to recover with. The third song on the album to eclipse anything the band has done thus far, with a quiet melody that is very pleasant. B+All This Time: While too similar in rhythm to the previous song, the hook saves this track from obscurity. Not too great, but not bad either. C+Fear: Another song that recycles the beats of the previous song. The vocals are pretty strong, but this just isn't original enough. CWaking Up: The same thing can be said for this track. This could have been merged with the previous two tracks without much hassle. CMarchin On: Barely different from the previous two, and the same in nature lyrically to the previous. This is getting a bit ridiculous. CLullaby: This song was written to be sleep-inducing, and it does the job. I'm just not sure what the purpose that has on an album. DMercy (Bonus): Previously on the first album, this is a much better end to the album than the previous song is on the regular edition. This deserved more success as a single. BThis album is incredibly frustrating, due to how much potential was wasted. The first half is solid for the most part, but it seems like Ryan Tedder loves the beat on Good Life and decided to replicate it in very similar ways on the four songs that followed. Lullaby refuses to put a flailing album out of its misery, and this all equates to a 'singles' album. Combine four of these songs with the singles from Dreaming Out Loud, and that will get you a lean, solid OneRepublic release. As for this, it should be skipped.Recommended: All the Right Moves, Secrets, Everybody Loves Me, Good Life\n", "val": 0.0032600127160549164}

Honestly, music has never effected me that way unless accompanied by a sad/powerful movie.One Republic has such a variety of sounds.  Musically/Instrumentally, they are so diverse.  It's like a classical, pop, hip-hop, electronica and rock album all rolled into one.  Ryan Tedder's vocals are really unsurpassed.  There aren't many dudes that can hit notes like that.  \"All the Right Moves\" is tough to do live, yet he has managed to do it quite well.

{"text": "I just reviewed this album, but I also wanted to add my thoughts on the deluxe version, which I own.  So first I'll post my review of the album itself, and then I'll tag on my thoughts on the bonus songs included in this version.First, my review of `Waking Up':\"I really like OneRepublic.  I remember when I first heard `Apologize' and I was instantly hooked.  I love their style and their sound and Ryan Tedder's voice is magic to my ears.  He has the perfect falsetto, yet he never comes off as anything less than masculine in his delivery.  Lyrically, they have a nice repertoire, and just when I think that they can't one-up themselves I hear the next track and I'm engaged all over again.All of this said, they have yet to produce an album as universally complete as I know they are capable of.In parts `Waking Up' is a great album.  Sadly, OneRepublic winds up tied down by the one thing that makes them so unique; their sound.  When you hear any of the songs on this album it is instantly obvious that it is a One Republic song.  Even before Ryan starts serenading us, we know that his voice is about to be broadcast.  OneRepublic has a signature sound that they drench each and every track on this album with to the point where their songs start to run into one another.It's a shame, I know.The eleven tracks on this album range from great to mediocre, with only really one song standing out as unappealing to me, but then again only three stand out as truly amazing to me.The album opens with a gigantic bang, the first three songs basically setting the bar SO high that the only way to go from there was down.  `Made For You' is a fantastic opening track, perfectly fusing the pop beats with the soft piano and that chorus is just hauntingly hushed yet loud with emotional merit.  `All the Right Moves' keeps the energy high with a chorus so energetically engrossing you can't help but become a part of the song.  Still, `Secrets' is even better.  The musical opening is stunning and instantly grabs the listener.  The lyrical content is pure and poignant.  When the songs snaps into attention less than 40 seconds in with that stunning chorus you know that you have found this bands opus.And then the album starts to spiral away from itself.`Everybody Loves Me' is rich with satirical content, but it just doesn't manage to be anything more than a Beck soundalike.  `Good Life' is `happy-inducing' but it is also a tad lazy.  It just sounds so familiar for them, with no real newness to it.  That said, I really like the song.  In fact, I really like the entire album, it just doesn't wow me like I expected after that one-two-THREE punch right off the bat.  `Marchin On' has grown on me, if not for the fact that it shows true ambition.  It can feel a tad long, but no where near as long as the title track, `Waking Up', comes off as.  In fact, that song is the one that I just DO NOT LIKE.  It is just really bland and it carries on for far too long.  `Missing Persons 1 & 2' is nice and subtle, yet it doesn't leave a major impact.  It is pretty to listen to, but Ryan's voice does seem to strain in parts.  I do like the haunting quality to the song, but it just doesn't live up to potential.  The shift in song structure is also odd.  Why didn't they separate this into two tracks?  `All This Time' sounds like something they've already done, with no real spark or anything to remember.  In fact, it actually sounds a tad dated.  `Fear' is simply forgettable.  It almost feels like an afterthought.The closing song `Lullaby' would have been less disappointing had the rest of the album been more impressive.  It isn't a bad song at all, and it would generally be a great way to end an album (soft, sweet, serene) but instead it just becomes another seemingly dull song.In the end, I still give this album a B and recommend it if you are a fan of the group.  Ryan Tedder is going to stick around (highly in demand as a song writer and producer as well) so I don't expect this band to go away anytime soon, which is a good thing.  I want them to release an album that lives up to what I know they can create.  They have the goods and they have a unique and signature sound that I really wish they would use to the full instead of allowing it to defeat them by rendering them seemingly `one-note'.\"Now, for my thoughts on the bonus disc:Like my review title suggests, this deluxe version really doesn't add anything new to the picture.  Aside from the beautifully delicate `It's a Shame', this is just a mix of mediocre fare.  If you purchased the Exclusive provided by this site then you will also have their cover of Duffy's `Mercy'.  I actually love what they did with it.  The original is better (obviously) but their cover shows some versatility on their part and I want to see more of that.  `Passenger' is just horribly crafted.  It is not only boring but it is musically annoying (the guitar riff is ear-splitting).  `Trap Door' and `Sucker Punch' are not bad, but they really lack any true spark.  They definitely feel like B-Side tracks that were left off the album for a reason, not bonus tracks we should be grateful were released for us.  `Sucker Punch' has a Harvey Danger feel to it, which I kind of like, but it isn't developed enough.Here is my ranking for those interested:1) Secrets2) Made for You3) All the Right Moves4) Mercy5) Good Life6) It's a Shame7) Marchin On8) Everybody Loves Me9) Lullaby10) Missing Persons 1 & 211) Sucker Punch12) All This Time13) Trap Door14) Fear15) Waking Up16) Passenger\n", "val": 0.016964642331004143}

While OneRepublic's debut album wasn't all that great, they managed to kick it up a few belts and produced one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.OneRepublic's \"Waking Up\" has more than a few good songs on it. With such tracks as \"All the Right Moves,\" \"Secrets,\" \"Good Life,\"Fear\" and \"Made for You\" are all good tracks that deserve a listen to.If you're looking for an album to purchase and one that doesn't have the obligatory 2 good songs and the rest are crap then give this album a try. It's rare that an album that comes along and features more good songs on it than bad songs. If you're a fan of groups like Train, Owl City and Five for Fighting, then give these guys a try. It's well worth it.\n", "val": 0.030924314633011818}
{"text": "To be honest, I'm not sure what made me buy this album.  I guess I'd heard \"All the Right Moves\" and dug the overall sound [heavy on the drums, touches of cello, etc.].  I don't own \"Dreaming Out Loud\", but of course I've heard the singles from it [Apologize, Stop and Stare, All I Need] many times on the radio.  I wasn't *quite* sure what to expect when I bought the follow-up, \"Dreaming Out Loud\".  After I listened to it the first time, I needed a few days to let it sink in before I could form an opinion.Well, after owning and listening to this album for several weeks now, I am absolutely in love with it.  It's like one of those great movies that you can watch over and over and discover something new about it every time.  One Republic blends everything good from the history and various genres of music and creates work that is both current and catchy, while being complex, touching and [ultimately] classic.  I'm struck by how their songs can be simultaneously funky and symphonic, inspirational, and achieve a depth that you would NEVER, EVER find on the vast majority of pop albums out today.  They leave \"artists\" (and I use the term lightly) like Britney Spears and Black-eyed Peas in the dust, and rise to the ranks of true musical icons like U2.  In fact, the title rack \"Waking Up\" could FLAWLESSLY slip into a place on any U2 album and fans of either band would not be disappointed.What I'm noticing with the [few] people who don't care for this album and gave it only 1 or 2 stars is they are likely used more mainstream \"pop\" albums, and \"Dreaming out Loud\" (based on the singles released) was a little more of the radio-ready/traditional/safe type of music people are accustomed to hearing.  However, \"Waking Up\"(in my opinion) goes deeper and further than that, and really shows off what Ryan Tedder and the group are capable of, which is nothing short of musical genius.  What you have here is a band whose success is not anchored by having a hot lead singer or hot single you can blast at your next party - they are the real deal, they understand music as a whole (as evidenced by the vast variety of artists Tedder has produced songs for), and I hope they stay around for a looooong time, because they deserve to.Favorite tracks:Good Life - you can't listen to this song and not feel happySecrets - one of those classic power ballads that will get stuck in your headAll This Time - sweet and emotional love song that builds to a BEAUTIFUL instrumental break towards the endMarchin' On - inspiring, great beat, gets me to push a little harder on the treadmillEverybody Loves Me - funky, Southern-rock infused ditty satirizing self-absorbed people\n", "val": 0.009528325870633125}

{"text": "EDIT:  I am raising my rating on this album to 5 stars because I just realized that it is four years old and it STILL sounds fresh every time I listen to it - including right at this very moment.  That is serious quality.  If you just picked up their new album \"Native\" and are looking to complete your collection, please add this.  Immediately.I was introduced to OneRepublic by a friend of mine who lent me their first CD.  I wasn't overly impressed at first, but as time went on, I appreciated it more and more.  I also realized I had heard of the frontman Ryan Tedder waaaaay before Timbaland got a hold of \"Apologize\" (which, imo, he gets too much credit for - the original's not much different from the remix) and I was thrilled he'd finally gotten his break.  This kid is CRAZY talented (vocalist, producer, songwriter, and he plays 4 instruments!) and that kind of talent can't stay secret for too long.  Before I knew it, I was playing \"Dreaming Out Loud\" constantly and it's still on regular rotation.  So it was with little hesitation that I picked up their latest effort, and I was not disappointed.  The group has managed to retain their signature sound while still demonstrating growth.  While there were a couple of tracks on \"Dreaming Out Loud\" that sounded too similar, here, each tune is distinctive.  Every time I listen to the CD, I have a new favorite (today it's \"Good Life\") and I love that it continues to surprise me.  \"Made For You\" opens the CD and I knew it was a hit when I was walking around singing it after only one listen!  \"Secrets,\" \"Everybody Loves Me,\" \"All The Right Moves,\" and \"All This Time\" are also standouts, but I can't say there are any truly weak tracks.  It will suit your mood - regardless of what your mood is.  Overall, I am VERY happy with my purchase.  This one will remain in rotation for quite a while as well.  Can't wait to heare the new songs live.  Bravo!\n", "val": 0.02220422960817814}
{"text": "On the whole, this was a disappointing follow-up to their excellent Dreaming Out Loud.  They attempt to compensate for the lack of depth in songwriting with a wide range of musical styles, none of which suit the band.  \"All the Right Moves\" is a worthy and catchy track, but will fail to retain the replay value of \"Stop and Stare\" or \"Apologize.\"  \"All this Time\" is the only other track I would recommend downloading.  It's a slow, heartfelt number; a quality largely lacking on the remainder of the album.  I feel that OneRepublic, in their quest to prove they are not who they've been defined as, have lost themselves.  Hopefully they will be able to recover from the weak response they are bound to receive after this effort.\n", "val": 2.6589399567455985e-05}

Feeling lonely and helpless I struggled for over 4 weeks to shake it off, reason with myself and get myself back to normal again.I received this CD in the mail yesterday from a mystery friend who seemed to have noticed me from a distance that I had shut myself out from the world but needed help. There was no note, no name of the sender but the music and lyrics said it all... touched my heart heart, and uplifted my sprits. For the first time in months, I woke up feeling positive, hopeful and ready to open myself to world and find the joy and love for life again. I had never heard of this group before, but this is music that touches the soul. It made me feel loved and really woke me up to a world full of love, kindness and beautiful souls - just the way I knew it before.I hope my mystery friend reads this and knows how thankful and deeply moved I am. The holiday season is upon us and amidst all the celebrations there are many who a lonely and have no one to celebrate with. If music is one of their passions, this CD is just the perfect way to pay it forward and make someone feel loved. I am awake now and ready to spread the love and the joy of music again.

{"text": "I am absolutely blown away by One Republic's second offering.  I honestly didn't think they'd be able to live up to the first album, Dreaming Out Loud, and braced myself for a less-than-stellar release.  I am pleased to say that I was dead wrong.  Not only have they lived up to it, they've surpassed it!  It's a completely magical experience and I feel lucky to have such beautiful music to brighten my world with.

{"text": "An Intricate & Captivating Masterpiece!When I heard \"Apologize\" for the first time on my stereo I was immediately blown away. I haven't heard such a beautifully, elegantly orchestrated song before in my entire life, or at least for a very very long time. I can't recall such an experience in the last couple of years.Needless to say, I purchased \"Dreaming Out Loud\" on a whim because it was on sale for eight bucks and an album can't be that awful, contain fifteen songs, and be hideous for that price. I ended up discovering probably one of my favorite new bands of all time and discovering music on a level unexplainable.Ryan Tedder is music producer talent extraordinaire. He has been on the map for the last few years being behind the scenes, but his duet with Timbaland really put this superstar on the map. Lyrics and production by Ryan for \"Bleeding Love\" just really put him on the map and it only went uphill from there when \"Halo\" was released. The boy just excels, but I digress.Dreaming Out Loud was constantly being rotated on my Zune and its one of the few albums that I listen to on a daily basis. With each listen I found something new to love, or noticed something in the lyrics that wasn't there before and just fell more in love with OneRepublic. I always thought in my head that if time came for their next album that it would just be a big feat to topple the mass appeal that was DOL. I have to say after listening to \"Waking Up\" that OneRepublic has done just so. If you loved DOL then you will love their latest effort \"Waking Up\". It's a CD full of new great material from an amazing band. The album is definitely more alternative and a bit different from the first, but it's still got the OneRepublic magic touch. Ryan has such a wonderful way of using words, so intricate and captivating. The album is a feel good album and just gives you the feeling of hope and the sentiment emotion to want to leave earth a better person.My favorite track is SECRETS. When the song starts and I heard those violins playing, I knew I was in for a treat and it was nothing bit a sweet treat. The sound of those violins were beyond hypnotic and Ryan plays and blends the lyrics and the chorus so seamlessly that it's nothing but stellar. Profound music on a cosmological level.The only down side is that there are only eleven tracks. I was hoping for fifteen again. Get the album and enjoy what a real masterpiece album is about.\n", "val": 0.01318265125155449}

{"text": "I know--if you're reading this you're probably thinking: \"What two albums?\".  For some reason, Amazon is combining the reviews for&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Scary-Monsters-And-Nice-Sprites-EP/dp/B004GGM444/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites EP</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/More-Monsters-And-Sprites-EP/dp/B0055M9WBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">More Monsters And Sprites EP</a>.  I learned this trying to review both separately.  The system informed me that I had already submitted a review.  As the dual listings seem to indicate, these are separate albums (as far as I can tell).  So, I figured I'd submit one big review for both albums.  If Amazon sorts out the review thing I'll try to come back to split them up.The quick review is that I'll be keeping both Sprites albums on my playlist.  I feel like there's a little bit of remix fluff here (I like remixes, but I prefer when they feel more like separate songs).  Either way, both are solid albums.Scary Monsters and Nice SpritesThere are some really fun moments on this album.  Rock 'N' Roll (Will take you to the mountain) has a solid beat.  If you don't like the repetition of electronic music (why are you looking at a Skrillex album?) you may get tired of the repetitious vocals.  I'm not turned off.  The end is interesting--shouting about how rock and roll will take you to the mountain.  I'm not sure where these samples originated, but they're funny.I'd say the title track is another favorite (along with Rock 'N' Roll).  This is a cool track, and has some great bass drops (very characteristic of Skrillex).  Skatta features Foreign Beggars (a British hip hop band and dubstep act) as well as Bare Noize (another British dubstep artist).  The song feels as busy as it sounds.  The bass is mean and growly.  Skatta grew on me quickly.  All I ask of you adds something a little different to the album.  It sounds like it could have come from David Guetta rather than Srillix.Kill Everybody could get you some odd looks if you play it too loud at a coffee shop.  Not surprisingly, there's some lyrics about killing everybody in the world.  Come to think of it, just about anything on this album might get you some strange looks at a coffee shop.  Keep flying your freak flag high ; )With You, Friends isn't really a personal favorite, but it's very relaxing track to listen to.  There are also three remixes: 2 of Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, 1 of Kill Everybody.  These are decent remixes.  Not much about the remix tracks stands out too much to me, though.More Monsters and SpritesIf you're thinking of buying More Monsters and Sprites, I'm sure you can guess what you're getting into.  That is: several remixes of the track&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Scary-Monsters-And-Nice-Sprites/dp/B004GGJ8KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites</a>.  These are strong tracks.  When they pop up on my player I tend to forget that I'm listening to remixes of the same song (which is nice).  I think I like the (Kaskade Remix) version the best.  Of all the remixes, it feels like its got the most original content.The two Ruffneck tracks are fun.  They've got a nice, light melody line that ties them together.  Between the two I think that (Full Flex) is my favorite of the two version.  I really like the breakdown at about 2:30.I'm obviously saving the best on More Monsters and Sprites for last (possibly the best among both albums).  First of the Year (Equinox) is a real treat for Skrillex fans.  I can't get enough of it, especially now that I've seen the video.  This song samples the infamous \"Call 911 now!\" youtube video.  The video inspired by the song is about a little girl with demonic powers taking her wrath out on a creepy, would-be kidnapper.  Equinox exemplifies the sort of crazy bass and erratic sampling that we've all come to expect out of Skrillex.There's a lot out of both of these albums for Skrillex fans.  I think both of these are a great deal better than the free \"My Name is Skrillex\" download.  If you like these I would highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bangarang/dp/B006PAZMMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bangarang</a>.\n", "val": 0.0014027907745912671}

{"text": "What if Ray Charles had died in the 1950's, and all that we had left of his immense genius were a handful of precious recordings?  Would you ignore them if MCA butchered the reissue?  Unfortunately, that is the choice that we are faced with here.The previous reviewer is absolutely right about the inexcusably poor job that MCA did with this reissue.  The old vinyl album WAS better quality.  But my copy of that is pretty worn, and there is a whole world of younger folks out there who have never heard of the Rev. Archie Brownlee, who was the young Ray Charles role model, but died in 1959, leaving only a handful of recordings.  Yes, he was that good, good enough to inspire a Ray Charles.  Tony Heilbut in his authoritative \"The Gospel Sound\" called him \"the baddest man on the road\", perhaps the most intensely emotional singer in the golden age of great gospel singers, with a raw scream that was echoed directly in Wilson Pickett and James Brown.Here's my suggestion - listen hard to the recorded samples here.  Don't turn them off at the first sound of that godawful cheesy reverb - leave it on till your ears start to make allowances for the bad remastering.  See if the magic of this powerhouse group and their brilliant lead singer doesn't triumph over the pitiful transfer.  In the end, I decided that Archie Brownlee, badly recorded and on only a few cuts, is better than no Archie Brownlee at all.  Until MCA comes to its senses. 5 stars for the Five Blind Boys and Rev. Archie Brownlee - 0 for recording quality.\n", "val": 4.80640992464032e-05}
{"text": "Don't by this CD - it's a travesty to the memory of the late and oh, so very great Archie Brownlee and The Boys. The packaging is good with fine photographs but poorly written and inaccurate sleevenotes. Vague recording dates and original single catalogue numbers are a welcome bonus. That's the CD's good points; now the bad ones: only 12 tracks and a 36 minute running time and only 7 of these feature Archie And The Boys in their 1950's prime. But what is MOST UNFORGIVEABLE is the DIRE SOUND QUALITY. I have some of these tracks on 1970 vinyl reissues which sound better than this CD which must want to make you believe these recordings were made in an aircraft hangar. Even if the master tapes have been lost there are cleaner sounding versions available on vinyl which they could have made dubs from.Archie Brownlee is quite correctly recognised as being one of the greatest singers of the last century and he deserves better than 7 dreadfully mastered tracks. You must try harder MCA - surely you can do better than this? The one star is for the great photos - nice packaging, shameful content.\n", "val": 6.658005440840498e-05}

Its not their best live album but the setlist and historic occasion make it a good album nevertheless. The real nice part of this release is that it has been repackaged to include both the Canadian and US versions of the original release plus it includes a live version of Gimme Love (that was part of the show but previously available only as a B-side).Highlights for me are Gimme Love, smoking versions of Slowpoke and Drop Your Guns, and a nice cover of Bob Segarini's Juvenile Delinquent. For those who have this on vinyl you'll notice some differences in the between song banter between band and crowd as well as a more muted crowd noise in general.A number of these songs no longer get played at April Wine shows so its a good album to own and get to hear songs like Gimme Love, You Won't Dance with Me live.\n", "val": 0.026473775506019592}

The album spawned four top ten hits, went to number one, spent almost a year in the top ten and over three years in the top 200.  Part of the band's appeal lays in the fact that they seem like just an average bunch of guys who could live in your neighborhood or play on your local softball team.  The songs on Sports are straight ahead, no nonsense songs that full of picture perfect harmonies and appealing hooks.  \"The Heart of Rock 'N' Roll\" opens up the album and sets the tone with its roll call of towns and its catchy chorus.  \"Heart & Soul\" is a jumping song with it's pounding guitars and punchy lyrics. \"Bad Is Bad\" shows off the band's slick harmonies in a southern fried soul style song.  \"I Want A New Drug\" maybe the band's most recognizable song and is just about as perfect a pop song as you can record.  \"Walking On A Thin Line\" tackles the serious subject of Vietnam Vets dealing with coming home from the war, but does so in a manner that is not self righteous or aggrandizing.  \"Finally Found A Home\" has a swift and pulsating pace while \"If This Is It\" is a bright and sunny track remiscant of The Beach Boys.  \"You Crack Me Up\" is a frenzied number and \"Honky Tonk Blues\" is a cover of a Hank Williams song in which the band lets loose.  The additional tracks are all fine, but the original nine tracks that made up Sports stand out on their own.

But if I was asked to compile a list of my 100 favourite 1980s albums, this one would be on the list.This is a very good re-master of Sports, with five extra bonus tracks added. The first two extra tracks are studio recordings of two tracks - The Heart of Rock & Roll and Walkin' On A Thin Line - that were on the album. These versions are good but not as good as the final versions of these tracks that were included on the original album release. The other three bonus tracks are live versions on This Is It, Heart and Soul and I Want A New Drug recorded at concerts in Los Angeles and San Francisco in 1984 and 1985 respectively. All good material but they don't differ significantly from the studio versions released on the original album. Despite that they're still worth having.Over all, a good re-issue and re-master of a classic 1980s album. The sound is good and the bonus tracks are worth having. I would recommend buying this version rather than the basic CD release containing only the material that was released on the original 1983 album.I see some of the other reviewers are criticizing the sound quality on this remaster.

I had an original Japanese pressing of this album, and took a punt by buying this anyway. I was initially pursuaded by the extra tracks and remastering claims. Then, before deciding which copy - this or the japanese pressig to get rid of, i read the reviews here on Amazon, and was alarmed by the negative, \"poor remastering\" reviews! So I sat down and crically listened, and compared both versions track by track. To THESE ears this version was much clearer, and better defined. Conclusion? Remastering on this seemed to work. I have kept this version and got rid of the Japanese copy.In addition, a brilliant album - always has been my favourite Huey Lewis album. Every track a winner...no filler.

{"text": "I always had this little thought in my mind that the title of this album referred somehow in the determination of the band itself,as being \"their really being good sports\" than something involving the sports bar imagery of the cover photography.It didn't matter either way,if the early 80's really were Huey Lewis's chance a bat he took his team straight to many winning games musically. Commercially? Well any copy of Billboard magazine from around 1984 will tell you so. Yes this album was every bit the massive hit parade expected in pop in the time. And most albums of this type have been savaged in the rock press over the years as guilty. I wouldn't agree with that at all. But this album bypassed that. Pleasure for sure. Guilty no. A set of nine songs,made with great care and craft and a lot of good ear for clean production and you had yourself a big commercially and creatively successful hit.  The hits are are of course some of the most impressive moments here. My personal favorites are the driving dance-rock of \"Heart And Soul\" that warmly embraces it's post disco influences with a nice slick bassline as well as the thumping \"I Want A New Drug\". The retro doo wop of \"If This Is It\" is also wrapped up in the same sleek soul dressing. \"The Heart Of Rock N Roll\" is classic 80's rock all the way. I could've asked for the horns to be somewhat less timid sounding. On the other hand they were accessory elements to this kind of song. \"Walking On A Thin Line\" is a somewhat lesser known hit on the album with an even more bright and polished sound. \"Bad Is Bad\" gets the groove going on a little bit as well,with a mildly more defiant stance. \"Finally Found A Home\" and \"You Crack Me Up\" are pretty straight ahead mainstream guitar pop,again not too far from hit type songs whereas \"Honkey Tonk Blues\" showcases their classic R&B side by albums end.  Aside from a few minor things here this is an excellent rock and roll album. It doesn't pretend the soul and R&B roots of the music don't exist. In fact that's a point this album continues to make again and again,both musically and lyrically. Even though it's basically very contemporary,the flavor Huey Lewis evokes has a nostalgiac flavor to it. Again it might have something to do with the Reagan era attitude about the \"return to traditional American values\",which I guess referred to that of the late 50's/early 60's veneer that this band seems to have embraced. On the other hand,there was a healthy dose of the new wave era attitude in them too which made for a vital hybrid of sound and intentions. This would be the end of their roll call of success by a long shot. But when most people think of Huey Lewis & The News,it's probably going to be one of the tunes from this album that will come to mind first.\n", "val": 0.02068152464926243}

The remastering is no lie on this version as the sound quality is excellent although I still question the need for the bonus tracks which end up detracting from the overall enjoyment of the cd.  Perhaps I could live with the 3 live tracks as they give us a glimpse of what the band was like live but do we really need 2 session takes of \"The Heart of Rock and Roll\" and \"Walking On a Thin Line?\"  The powers that be should really make some effort in future releases to ensure that the bonus tracks are there for a reason and actually add to the overall enjoyment of the cd instead of just being filler of cd space!The mlps design also leaves much to be desired having been poorly assembled with poor quality thin cardboard that looks as if it will come apart soon when the glue gets old.  For good quality mlps design see the ones done for the Hall & Oates and The Band series as good examples.  This is a very pricey version though and while the excellent sound quality goes a long way to justify the price the inferior mlps design surely does not.

{"text": "SPORTS is the greatest original album by Huey Lewis & The News. It was practically inescapable on the radio during 1983-84, and even those who are tired of hearing certain songs, such as \"The Heart Of Rock & Roll\", will find much to admire in the band's streamlining of English pub-rock, West Coast country-rock, early rock & roll, Southern boogie-rock, power-pop, Heartland rock, and soul/R&B influences, as well as Lewis' opposition to people picking on each other's differences. Some of the best songs here are among the most underrated, including \"Walking On A Thin Line\", a harrowing yet rocking tale about a Vietnam veteran so traumatized by his war experiences that he won't let his younger daughter date until his older one finds a boyfriend, and the joyous rocker \"Finally Found A Home\", which could be about finding your roots musically. Many athletes, including the San Francisco 49ers during their Super Bowl-winning streak, as well as many people who worked out regularly during this album's chart run, loved SPORTS.

Why can't music be the way it was back then?  You know, good.  Most of todays music isn't worth a nickel and that's simply putting it in it's place.  There is still some good music out there but it's hard to find.  As for the rest of it, rap, most of the pop, and most of the alternitive rock just doesn't have it.  On the other hand, I would perfer alternitive rock and pop over rap any day!  Some of the alternitive rock is good but unfortunatly, as I said earlier, is hard to find.

{"text": "Okay, so the songs are simple and nothing breaks new ground.  But the one thing about this group is the immense amount of fun they are clearly having making music.  \"Sports\" is a diverse collection of trendy songs and faithful tributes.  Here's a song by song snapshot:The Heart of Rock and Roll - a fun, poppy, hook-laden tribute to the history of rock music and a celebration of what's yet to come.  Those horns make the song soar at the end.Heart and Soul - their first top 10 hit and a great pop song finished off with some cool power chords.Bad Is Bad - I used to hate this song, but time has made me come to love the wonderful bluesy vocal harmonies and the controlled playing.  This is  where you find just how tight a band they are.I Want A New Drug - One of the coolest News songs; the lyrics are terrific and the band plays it into the stratosphere, with horns making the song fly once again.Walking On A Thin Line - My personal favorite News song.  Kind of autobiographical, but the tight playing - particularly in the chorus - makes this song special and timeless.Finally Found A Home - Another great, but forgotten song; it's almost the band's lyrical response to the struggles expressed in Walking On A Thin Line. Those who don't know the News beyond their bounty of hits need to hear this song to really appreicate them.If This Is It - A poppy breakup song - to me it's the weakest offering on the album, but when Huey wails \"If this is it, please let me know\", you actually buy it.  So it's still okay.You Crack Me Up - yeah, it's simple and says nothing new.  And they sound like they're having so much fun, you'll wish you were right there in the studio when they recorded it.Honky Tonk Blues - only years later did I realize how big a deal it is -  a so-called 80's pop band covering Hank Williams, not just covering it, but capturing all the passion of the song.Music is blessed with diverse artists.  Some are there to challenge our thought process, and that's where Dylan came in.  Some are there to set new trends - enter the Beatles.  Some are there to lend the music to a rebellious generation - thank you Stones!  Some made sonic exploration the playground, like Pink Floyd.  And some blended wild amounts of style into new sounds, like Led Zeppelin.  But sometimes, we dismiss those artists that just want to bring music to its simplest level and just make it fun and entertainment.  And nobody since the mid sixties did it any better than the News did on this album.  The best way to enjoy this album is to invite all your friends over, crack open a cold one, turn it up loud and  par-tay!\n", "val": 0.03138115257024765}

{"text": "In the 1980s and 1990s, the music landscape has taken on a \"regional theme\". We've heard references to the \"L.A. Scene\" (hard rock), Seattle (grunge), Arizona (Alternative Rock), and many other places. In 1983, San Francisco made it back on to the music map with a breakthrough album by Huey Lewis and the News called \"Sports\". This would be the third album by Huey Lewis and the News. \"Sports\" provided a unique mix of pop, rock, honky-tonk, new-wave, and retro sounds that made it one of the 1980s most successful albums.  In fact, many do consider it a landmark album because it was so successful  It was the unique sound - as well as the title of the album that would attract me to get this album.  Once I listened to this album, I felt it didn't live up to a lot of the hype.  This edition is a re-release of the 1983 version that includes some bonus tracks.Huey Lewis and the News' unique sound is highlighted by the band lineup.  While lead singer Huey Lewis will occasionally contribute harmonica,  but ultimately it is Johnny Colla's saxophone that really gives the band its trademark sound.  Another unsung hero of the band is bassist Mario Cipollina who really delivers some outstanding work on \"Sports\".  Despite the many influences from different genres, I wouldn't call the band's sound complex.  Most of the arrangements seem pretty straight-forward.  From a lyrical standpoint, \"Sports\" doesn't offer anything really deep - the songs are pretty basic.  When you combine the music and lyrics together - the end result for the most part an upbeat and light-hearted sound.Here is a track by track review of the nine original tracks from \"Sports\":\"The Heart of Rock and Roll\":  While this wasn't the first single, this is the song that really helped Huey Lewis and the News become a household name.  This song is definitely one of the best songs done by the band.  As a geography buff, I appreciate the \"roll call\" of cities around the United States.  Lewis delivers flawless vocals, but ultimately it is going to be trademark Johnny Colla saxophone that gives this song its identity.  Cipollina's bass work is flawless and provides a terrific bass track throughout the song.\"Heart and Soul\":  This is one of those songs that got a lot of airplay on radio and charted high.  However, this song never had me doing handstands and I find it kind of boring.  The guitar work by Chris Hayes is very good.  The keyboard tracks (while not an indictment of Sean Hopper's abilities - he is very good) - just don't do it for me.\"Bad is Bad\":  This song demonstrates some of \"retro\" sounds that Huey Lewis has become famous for.  It features some \"doo wop\".  While the band nails the sound, I actually feel that Lewis' vocals seem a bit out of place on this song.  Again, this is not an indictment of Lewis - who I consider a solid vocalist.  The background vocals are right on the money.\"I Want a New Drug\":  This is another song that got a lot of airplay and charted high.  The best way I characterize this song is \"good\" and \"not great\".  This song will be highlighted by Lewis' vocals - as he demonstrates considerable ranges on this song.  Once again, Colla's saxophone playing will steal the show.\"Walking on a Thin Line\":  Of the five singles that charted from this album, this was the only one that didn't hit the top 10.  This might be one of the best songs done by the band.  There isn't anything I would change on this song.  I found this song to have a harder Rock edge than many of the other songs on this album.  Cipollina's bass is the highlight of this song.  This song has a darker side to it - particularly during the two verses, but the chorus helps to uplift the song.\"Finally Found a Home\": Of the songs that weren't released as singles from \"Sports\", this is probably the best of the lot.  At times this song has a Classic Rock feel - complete with guitars and keyboards.  Hayes and Hopper are going to be the standout musicians on this track.\"If This is It\":  Huey Lewis points out in the live version included on the bonus tracks, he wishes that girls \"would just make up your mind\".  That pretty much is the topic of this track.  This is another track that got a lot of airplay and charted high.  I think this one of the most overrated tracks.  Yes it includes doo-wop and Johnny Colla's saxophone - but in the end this track just didn't do it for me.\"You Crack Me Up\": This song has a true early 1980s synth-pop feel to it.  I enjoyed the background vocals on this one.  This isn't a bad track either.  Each time I listened to it, it grew on me.\"Honky Tonk Blues\": This is a cover of a Hank Williams song.  It proves that the band can pull off a honky-tonk sound.  I give credit for the band doing a cover of this song, but I just didn't enjoy it.The collection also includes 5 bonus tracks.  Each of the five released singles have a bonus version included.  There are live versions of \"Heart and Soul\", \"I Want a New Drug\", and \"If This is It\".  There are alternate, unreleased versions of \"Walking on a Thin Line\" and \"The Heart of Rock and Roll\".  The bonus version of \"The Heart of Rock and Roll\" puts a country-like arrangement on the song.  I still wish live versions of \"Walking on a Thin Line\" and \"The Heart of Rock and Roll\" would have been included.Overall, this collection has its ups and downs.  While it's good - in the end it didn't bowl me over.  You may want to decide if this is the right collection for you.\n", "val": 0.029538201168179512}

{"text": "There was life for Huey Lewis and Sean Hopper when their first band became a no-leaf Clover-pardon the pun.  Together with bassist Mario Cippolina, drummer Bill Gibson, and lead guitarist Chris Hayes, Huey and friends got into journalism, well, Huey Lewis and the News actually, and they created their biggest headlines with Sports, their tertiary 1983 album, which yielded four Top Ten hits, yet somehow or other, I managed to hear all songs from Sports, making this one of my all-time favourite news... I mean classics.Sports takes what they improved on in Picture This, their tried mixture of soul and doo-wop harmonies, but with a lot of radio-friendly zing!  \"The Heart of Rock & Roll\" is a paean to the risqu, rowdy, and sensationalistic night life of big cities like New York, where one can do \"half a million things at a quarter to three.\"  Part of the song's chorus-\"now the old boy may hardly be breathing\" may be a reflection of the cul-de-sac rock music had gone through at the time, but leave it to Huey and the boys to give it a strong jolt in the arm-aww yeah!  The second of three singles to reach #6, and love that heartbeat-like drum that opens and closes this classic number!.The first single from Sports was \"Heart and Soul,\" penned by Nicky Chinn and Blondie-songmeister and producer Mike Chapman, which alternates between some easygoing keyboards from Sean Hopper and some snarling grinding hard-edged guitar chops from Hayes.  This became their second Top Ten hit, peaking at #8.\"Bad Is Bad,\" a 50's blues-tinged doo-wop number, yielded a video, yet didn't crack the Top 100.  Bad is given both connotations, cool re the cousin who plays his guitar with a chainsaw buzz, and tasteless regarding a man finding a note reading \"I love you\" and \"someone else's shoes, underneath my bed.\"For sheer energy, how can one beat \"I Want A New Drug?\"  This search of a new panacea instead of those pharmaceutical nightmares or under-the-counter pills celebrities pop, indicate a criticism of the  pharmaceutical industry but also of Hollywood itself perhaps.  Lewis later sued Ray Parker Jr. for cribbing the rhythm of this for \"Ghostbusters.\"  I do detect some similarity between the songs, but fortunately, the matter was settled out of court so there wasn't a repeat of George Harrison vs the Chiffons.The fifth single, \"Walking on a Thin Line,\" reached #18, begins with a pulsing high-tech sounding bassline which becomes the backbone of the song, before going into a rocking song of frustration about an ex-veteran, and the scarring aftereffects of war.I remember the mid-paced doowop rock with a tinge of beach harmonies, and third #6 single, \"If This Is It,\" from the video on MTV, and both video and song paralleled, of a guy fed up of the relationship games being played.  At least the video had a happy ending, as a nice-looking blonde who had witnessed the scene between Huey and the woman in question, wordlessly invites the dejected guy to walk along the beach with her.The boisterous \"You Crack Me Up,\" with its running synth line, harmony backups, rapid-fire delivery from Lewis, and neat Hayes guitars makes this the best non-single of this album.  I bet they could've released this as a followup to \"Walking on a Thin Line\" and made another Top Ten single.Their cover of Hank Williams' \"Honky Tonk Blues\" is a great pub rock tune complete with John McFee on steel guitar that rounds off the album, except for the bonus tracks, which are live or demo takes of the singles.I was surprised I didn't wear out my copy of the cassette when I first bought it long ago.  Hearing this remastered version, that polished production of the News' sound, and the infectiously catchy melodies brings back fond memories when music was great.  Thanks to them, the heart of rock and roll kept on beating...for a while longer anyway.\n", "val": 0.0014252226101234555}

Instead, with his gin-soaked voice and craggy face, Huey and his \"sport\" mates slam-dunked their way to infinite rock & roll stardom on this TOTAL winning album.  Score 100 for Huey, 0 for the bad-guy pop stars.My question is, how could you not enjoy this anthem-like, arena-ready album?  It's got something for everybody, whether you're a sports fan or not.  Most of the album is highly pop, but there's just enough of a rock edge to give the album some genuine flair.  Each song is meticulously crafted and extremely catchy.  In fact, \"Sports\" by Huey and the gang is so incredibly song-driven, you almost hope for a mistake somewhere along the way.  I disagree strongly with the added live tracks and session tracks that have been tacked on to the latest remastered version of this album, since it takes away from the '80s classicism one originally heard: just 8 quick songs and that was it.  Of course, nowadays record companies must include all sorts of bells and whistles to get people buying, but back in the '80s, man, all we needed were the tunes!Well, what else can I say?  Huey writes surprisingly in-depth lyrics that speak to everybody.  And, Huey's band is known for liking the blues, as is evident on the eighth and final track (or at least it was the final track until Huey's record company messed with the album).  At any rate, \"Sports\" by Huey is a sure-fire hole-in-one.  No doubt about it, Huey and the boys racked up a spectacular touchdown with this record, scored a 3-point bucket with mere seconds left on the clock, ran back a 85-yard touchback to tie the game, pitched a no-hitter, won the match in straight sets, ran the 400-meter race in record time...\n", "val": 0.006217596586793661}

If you're a Foreigner fan I really can't see anything not to like here, unless you're just prejudiced against a different singer then Lou Gramm.  Lou Gramm was the heart of Foreigner as far as the singer, but times change, people change, people move on and Mick, I guess, just wanted to keep playing music.

By the way ...there are plenty of places online to get sensational bootleg DVDs of the classic Lou Gramm Foreigner ...and in particular the spectacular supershow from Tokyo in 1985 that makes the more recent edition of the group look like a Vegas lounge act.\n", "val": 0.0004885404487140477}

The concert runs about 90 minutes, with all the standards like Double Vision, Cold as Ice, Hot Blooded, Juke Box Hero, etc. Feels Like the First Time is not an essential purchase for Foreigner fans, but when you can pick up two cds & a dvd for under twelve dollars you really have no reason to complain because you don't like one or even two of the items.

As a bonus, they even did a meet and greet with fans and allowed you to get your picture taken with the whole band.

All of that said, CD 1 The Acoustic Set, really works for me. No, the tracks don't have the fervor and passion of their highly produced and polished legacy hits. Obviously, many of the original members are gone from this lineup. But damn if this new singer can't sing! And the arrangements are very nicely put together and highly entertaining.It's not the head-banging, dashboard pounding music of our youth. If you want that, put the original CDs in the player. Bam. You're happy.However, if you're interested in hearing several of your favorite Foreigner hits stripped down to their essence, with the lyrics fully understandable, with soaring vocals and the core melodies upfront and center...you will probably like this set.Now, CD #2...the remakes. At first I didn't want to like the newly recorded versions. But the novelty of them grew on me over time. Still, there's a certain tinny brightness to the tracks, which may be due to over-compression. The dynamics just aren't there like in the original recordings. A certain warmth is missing.

And Lou has lost most of his singing ability, so Kelly Hanson is actually a true blessing to the band.  He perhaps sounds the most like Lou Gramm than anyone else out there whom I've heard, even Lou Gramm himself (in his current condition).I empathize with those who say that Foreigner is no longer Foreigner with Mick being the only remaining original member.  But the current line-up does a wonderful job of cranking out the old tunes.  My biggest complaint with Foreigner is that Mick Jones continues to push his band toward Pop music, when everyone knows that deep inside him, that rocker is just waiting to burst back out!\n", "val": 0.0002287261449964717}
{"text": "Let's get this straight right off the bat.  I'm a huge Foreigner fan.  The first four albums in their catalog are classics that contained top-notch writing, singing and instrumentation.  Their first two releases were amazingly strong albums, \"Head Games\" was a bit of a weaker effort (Blinded by Science, Rev on the Red Line notwithstanding) and 4 was the Apex of their career.  After these four albums however, Mick Jones was keen on attracting the adult contemporary crowd while Lou Gramm wanted the band to maintain their focus with a mixture of hard rockers and the occasional ballad.  The success of \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\" convinced Jones that the direction of the band should be toward that end.  Quite a bit of head-butting when on between Gramm and Jones until Gramm left the band in the late 80's to pursue a solo career, rejoining the band in '92 and leaving again for good in '03.  While Jones had complete artistic control over the band during this time they did manage to release the stellar tune \"I Want to Know What Love Is\", but gone were the days where Foreigner would sell 6 million copies of an album that contained multiple hard-driving hits.One has to give Mick Jones his kudos--great guitar player, great songwriter, arranger and producer as well. I really question his judgement on re-releasing previous Foreigner albums with a different band and a different singer.  Jones is the only original member of Foreigner involved with this re-release.  I couldn't help but think to myself while listening to this \"WHY?!?!\"  it's like karaoke versions of Foreigner songs with a singer doing his best Lou Gramm impersonation.  Embarrassing, really.  This is akin to Jimmy Page putting together some backing musicians, hiring a singer to impersonate Robert Plant and re-releasing the first 5 albums in the Zeppelin catalog.  The fans will most likely just go back and listen to the original recordings, right?1 star for creativity, one star for originality, and 1 fan who just bought the first five original Foreigner albums in a nice cd box set off Amazon for $16.99.\n", "val": 0.00010169300367124379}

Its not. Its anything but. So if you want a REAL collection of Foreigner hits LOOK ELSEWHERE!!!! Even at 5 bucks, its more than this collection of covers is worth.\n", "val": 0.0007977269124239683}

{"text": "If you own classic albums like \"DOUBLE VISION\" or \"4\" and believe that Mick Jones and Lou Gram are the only alignment acceptable , you might not want to buy this album. Any band without original members, can not reproduce the original feel of classic albums. I do not belong to the era in which they gave live concerts. Some fans are really displeased calling it Mick Jones and his band playing \"Foreigner\" songs.I have all their classic albums, and I don't regret buying this album. It's an additional experience, and yes Lou Gramm is not here ,but give the vocalist an opportunity, the vocalist made an effort to match the original. My respect goes to this band trying to please their fans, offering acoustic well crafted versions of the original radio hits, and re-recorded versions with a classic feel.For inexperienced bands, reproducing again their radio hits with 2 different approaches (acoustic, and re-recorded), with many studio hours, different members, and the pressure of the executives to sell \"tunes\" usually leads them to disaster.This band is no beginner,and even though only 1 original member remains, the instruments are well harmonized and the vocals will give a bit of nostalgia of their classic albums. If respected musicians like Bonham accepted to be part of this project(as associated act), it could be exciting to see this band come back and record new albums with musicians of this size.Try the CD only if you are open to the idea that you will not hear compilations in the original tempo with the original members. They could have offered more of the same HITS, and instead they went to the studio to re-record their songs, knowing that some fans would like it and some others wouldn't.\n", "val": 0.006885862909257412}

{"text": "\"What year is this?\" Mick Jones relates his most recent on-stage catharsis moment in front of young screaming fans on the DVD bonus interview. Oh yes, it \"feels like the first time\" once again but yet so much more. Of all the cassettes I wore-out in the 70's and 80's, Foreigner was number one. Getting through high school and college, starting a career and a family left me listening to bands along the lines of the Gin Blossoms and Collective Soul in the 90's. So, when the last of the albums and cassettes went bye-bye so did my Foreigner library. What a surprise it was (nearly ten years later) to be trudging through Wal-mart and spying this set. Picking it up I thought it was their first album remastered but no, it was an all-new 3 disc set! On a gut feeling, I bought it and played all discs PRIOR to contaminating (possibly) my mindset with the internet reviews (first time in many years). Bravo to all of the band (past-to-present) for an awesome synthesis of something old into something fresh and, at times, truly new. For those who are still not following, take a look at the latest Chevy Camaro, Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger where the design essence of the original is merged with both experience and modern advances - this set is the music equivalent. For long-ago fans (like I was), suggest first listening to Track 5 \" Fool For You Anyway\" on the \"Acoustique\" - if that doesn't do it for you, too bad, you're really missing out.\n", "val": 0.00010000266047427431}
{"text": "Foreigner's Feels Like the First Time is a triple disc release containing two audio cds and one dvd. The first cd is Foreigner unplugged playing many of their hits acoustic. CD two contains rerecordings of Foreigner's greatest hits with the current line up. The rerecordings are quite good as the band plays the songs just like the original recordings. Kelly Hansen's vocals sound close to Lou Gramm's voice as well. Like I said the rerecordings are good, but they won't replace the original versions. A concert dvd finishes off the set. As far as I know this concert has not been previously released in the United States. The concert runs about 90 minutes, with all the standards like Double Vision, Cold as Ice, Hot Blooded, Juke Box Hero, etc. Feels Like the First Time is not an essential purchase for Foreigner fans, but when you can pick up two cds & a dvd for under twelve dollars you really have no reason to complain because you don't like one or even two of the items. If you enjoy just one of the three you got your money's worth. I bought this for the dvd. I would have gladly paid a little more for it.

They chose to many from their first release titled Foreigner. Head Games was the album that put them on the map so they could have at least done one song from this release. The remakes are really cool but they are just remakes of the original tracks except they have a sharper sound as they are done digitally.

Don't buy into the title; this is gorgeous studio blending of strings and electronica.

She is not aware that the autumn leaves are cascading around her in a plume of cool air.A man being forlorn over the decisions he has made and longs for atonement.The seashore ebbs away by the surf only to regenerate again.Stone statues in a lush garden silently muses over their surroundings.These are only some of the thoughts I have when I listen to this album.  \"Winged Victory for the Sullen\" is the brain child of Adam Wiltzie from Stars of the Lid and pianist Dustin O'Halloran.  I am very familiar with the former being a fan of SOTL, but I wasn't with the latter...until this release.  I would defiantly say that these two musicians have synergy.The music itself is layered instrumental cacophonies. If I had to use a clever name to categorize it I would use \"neo-classical\".  There are strings, violins, bass, pianos and other things I am not able to pin point.  There is an ambient flare to some of the music on this album which gives it an interesting quality.I absolutely love this collect of music; it is so peaceful, beautiful, dark, haunting and yet still provides elements of hope.  The title of the album/group reflects the music nicely.  I believe fans of minimal, instrumental, classical, ambient and even movie scores would really enjoy this album.I am one of those folks who still like to get CDs and I am happy to say that this CD is housed in an actual plastic tray.  The reason I note this is because Kranky usually just slips their CDs in cardboard which leaves the CD open for scuffs and/or scratches.

The album has been playing nonstop at home and work since I first heard the streaming samples online and now that I received the CD from Kranky I have even higher quality FLAC versions ripped.  Their music is a wonderful mix between classical piano with ambient drone music perfected by the likes of Brian Eno and later by Stars of the Lid.  My only complaint is I wish they would have released a double CD as 45 minutes leaves you begging for more.  Too bad Amazon is only selling the lower bit rate MP3s as these songs are best heard with high quality headphones or a really good stereo system straight from CD that you can buy from Kranky or ripped in a lossless format like FLAC.\n", "val": 0.007486575748771429}
{"text": "In general, I tend to have a bit of a rocky relationship with ambient music. I absolute love it at its best, but I can also get bored with it very easily. Its usually no easy task for me to sit down and absorb a new ambient album, usually because they tend to be long-winded and a little dull at first. This album was a definite exception for me. I really feel it strikes a sweet spot that delivers those lovely droning ambient atmospheres while fully retaining listenability. Mostly all of the arrangements here are relatively tight and focused, giving a sense of direction that many ambient releases lack. Also, the presence of the delicate piano melodies really complements the glistening Stars of the Lid droning that can sometimes feel sparse on its own. Sure, there is a definite appeal to the sprawling, meandering ambient style, but I feel this album is a testament to the fact that cutting back on those indulgent tendencies can have spectacular results.\n", "val": 0.016847606748342514}

It's definitely an album to listen to from start to finish over and over again; certainly not a difficult proposition, as this music will be your soundtrack to anything from reading to walking to studying to stargazing.I hope this duo sticks together for a long time.

{"text": "Adam Wiltzie and Dustin O'Halloran must get on very well. They have combined here to release their first collaborative work, A Winged Victory For The Sullen, and done so in spectacular fashion. Guest appearances by the Icelandic cellist Hildur Gunadttir and violinist Peter Broderick only excite our neurons further. Delicate and restrained in its approach, this album is undeniably affecting.Wiltzie, one half of Stars of the Lid, is well versed at producing music that unfolds slowly, gradually enveloping the listener. There are shades of that here, but O'Halloran's contributions add structure and focus to the experience. On some tracks it is O'Halloran who is in the foreground. \"Minuet for a Cheap Piano Number Two\" is a beautifully haunting piano led piece that aches with sadness.  But elsewhere we find \"Requiem for a Static King (Part 1)\", a song that would not feel out of place on a Stars of the Lid album.For the most part, though, the album represents new territory for both artists. Their subtle, contemplative approaches combine to form a work that is deeply moving. At times it feels as if I'm listening to the soundtrack to a film about beautiful characters living tragic lives. If this is the effect Wiltzie and O'Halloran were hoping to achieve, they were certainly not in a hurry to do so. The songs seem to take single, often simple, ideas and meditate on them, allowing them to unfold and develop in their own time.  This concept is never more apparent than in the album's closing, and perhaps strongest, track \"All Farewells are Sudden\", where less really is more.A Winged Victory For The Sullen will move most who give it the time and attention it deserves. It represents the perfect blend of two wonderfully gifted musicians who have crafted an album that stands out as one of the very best of 2011.

{"text": "I had heard this song almost everywhere, especially on YouTube via amateur video recordings of various people showing off their bodies in some comedic way.  The song showed up so often that I forgot to download it to hear on my MP3 player.  The only bit rate that I had ever heard the song was at 96k or even 64k on all those personal videos.  And to say the least, 96 and 64 are not the best quality for music.  So one day I realized that I hadn't downloaded it and I did so.  The MP3 recording is in Joint Stereo and has a constant bit rate of 256 Kbps at a sampling rate of 44.1 KHz.  It is 3 minutes and 19 seconds long.  When I played it on my Sony MP3 player, using very expensive ear canal phones, I was nearly \"blown away\" at just how excellent a recording this song is.  The bass lines are deep, vibrating and rich.  The construction of music and voice is very expertly engineered.  The sound is pure, very pure.  There is absolutely no imperfection in the engineering of this work.  And to say the least, this song has become a very popular song and video to parody.  And thousands have done just that.  And they had a lot of fun doing it!Do I recommend this song?  Yes I do!  And I am not usually a dance music lover.  But this one is a must-have.\n", "val": 0.00826268084347248}
