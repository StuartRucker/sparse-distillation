{"text": "After releasing a handful of excellent EP's in 2009, Bethany Cosentino and Benn Bruno, aka as Best Coast, continue in the dream pop vein that they began, only their debut LP is more ambitious and entirely more focused.  The melodies are stronger, the instruments less distorted, the voices clearer. and the lyrics are much stronger.  Basically Best Coast have stepped up their game tenfold.  Track for track, Crazy For You is one of my favorite albums released this year along with Arcade Fire's 'The Suburbs' and a Ty Segall's 'Melted.'  When I was at university some 5 to 8 years ago I had come to the conclusion that all new music sucked with the exception of Radiohead, Wilco, Elliott Smith, The White Stripes, and The Shins.  Now, after the 2000s have come to a close and we are past the halfway point of 2010 I can look back over the past decade (plus this year) and safely say that it has been the best 10 years of music since 1963-1972.  And that is a BOLD statement considering that those years are viewed by all who know anything about modern music and it's history, as the golden era of melody and song-craft.  I was correct in my theory that all modern rock and pop music sucked and sucked hard.  However, that being true, what I was forgetting about was all the great music that came out on the independent labels!!  It began as far back as the mid to late 1990s with Belle and Sebastian and Cat Power from the now iconic Matador label, etc.  Hell, you could argue as far back as I.R.S. with R.E.M. or 4AD with The Pixies.  And now with bands like Best Coast via their Mexican Summer label leading the way along with Beach House, Fleet Foxes and many others, music is again an art form and albums a work of art.  And with all this being said, one of the the keys to finding EXTRA-ordinary new music like Best Coast is VINYL! Yes Vinyl, that wonderful 12\" black circle of wonderment.  If a new band releases their new albums on vinyl, chances are, they are a decent band, and in many cases such as Best Coast, a great band.\n", "val": 0.010161638259887695}
{"text": "If you liked the Vivian Girls' first LP, this is a no-brainer. It's very Californian, as probably every review that's been written on it has mentioned, in the way that Pavement's Crooked Rain Crooked Rain is, but it's got a taste of the Ramones in there also -- a few songs are in the mold of \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\" and that kind of stuff. It's a good album for put on when you're out on your skateboard and the night is just humming, like the Pavement song says.

{"text": "Pumping out 'Crazy for You' in the height of summer couldn't've been a better choice. Best Coast is dreamy, simple, fun, blunt, and great for blasting on even the cheapest of stereos. Best Coast channels Sleater-Kinney at their funnest, the simplicity of KRecords girl groups, the sloppiness of Hole, and the guitar noise only Kevin Shields could love. Noise aside, her voice is beautiful, too beautiful to be muddied over by fuzz, which happens quite frequently throughout the course of the album; moments in which the vocals peak, she has strong hints at Neko Case's siren call. I look forward to hearing that more prevalent on her following releases.\n", "val": 0.016239698976278305}
{"text": "Best Coast's debut record is a lovely little scuzzy pop gem. The band has been building a substantial buzz over the last year or so with a string of underground hit singles and splits, and now they've finally unleashed their first great work to the hungry masses. Best Coast, as the name implies, is a beach-inspired pop outfit, blending fuzzy melodies and simple, lovelorn lyrics to great effect. Crazy For You recalls the kind of heartsick feelings of teenage years, a simpler and more powerful time that we all long for again at some point.The album is short, but it's somewhat a boon, because this is music that could easily outstay its welcome. A 50+ minute album of fuzzy pop songs is inevitably going to lose its punch after awhile, so it was wise of the band to keep the album short and sweet. One of the more disappointing elements of the album is the reuse of a number of those aforementioned singles, which isn't uncommon, but given the time the band has been working on this record, I was hoping for a brand new set of songs. Nonetheless, the singles have been reworked and sharpened to a finer edge, and the album is truly a testament to razor-sharp love songs. The lyrics may not be the deepest you'll ever hear, but they're heartfelt and powerful in context of this collection of uptempo pop songs.Best Coast has been regarded through this year as a band to watch, and Crazy For You does not disappoint. A great album for any fan of noise and pop and any combination thereof.\n", "val": 0.020670441910624504}

{"text": "With their debut album, Los Angeles popsters Best Coast deliver a flavorful collection of sugary pop tunes slathered in a lo-fi sonic haze that suggests the raw energy, youthful exuberance and addictive hooks of early Ramones (\"[I Wish He Was My] Boyfriend\" could easily be a companion piece to the Ramones \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\") mixed with the sweet melodies of the Go Go's. This is pop of the bubblegum variety to be sure, but it's not your typical generic brand. It's pop with a slightly twisted soul and just enough tongue in cheek humor to make it palatable for both teenage girls and middle aged hipsters.Singer/songwriter Bethany Cosentino pens lyrics from the viewpoint of a down to earth if rather insecure and self conscious every girl who blurts out her feelings with the kind of simple honesty that's as endearing as it is amusing. Whether pining for a boyfriend or repeatedly declaring to a crush that \"When I'm with you I have fun,\" Cosentino isn't out to change the world or to provide any earth shattering truths or revelations. She's content to merely revel in the immediacy of a young woman's feelings as she navigates the pathways of romance and emotional pratfalls. \"Maybe I'm just crazy,\" Cosentino opines in the uber catchy title track \"Crazy For You.\"Some listeners may be put off by the limited scope of the album's subject matter and the repetitive lyrics, but then again this is the sound of a band just starting to realize its potential and not stepping very far outside its comfort zone as it shapes its identity. There's time for complexity later on. For now, let's just appreciate the musings of a woman who can sound perfectly sincere when uttering lines like, \"I promise you I won't be such a brat. If I promise you anything, I promise you that.\"\n", "val": 0.008205404505133629}
{"text": "Excuse me for a second as I rave about one of my favorite albums; this is absolutely perfect. I've seen someone once criticize the sound of this album because of its purposeful use of mixing to sound lo-fi. If you've heard this album on CD or through digital media, then you know this was done very beautifully as a bit of an homage to the original days of \"surf pop.\" That's what truly makes this album shine on vinyl. The high amounts of reverberation with lower than standard bitrate recording make this album a perfect fit for the limited sound space of vinyl records. Mainly artists today rely heavily on electronic back up noise, and, unfortunately that's led me to buy some less than perfect records. This is not that record. If you're looking for a great throwback to the days of surf pop, a great record filled with songs of infatuation, or simply a great addition to your record collection that'll look and sound good, this is your album.

{"text": "This is not an album you want to take seriously on any level ... though having said that, this is not an album you can avoid on any level either.  Crazy For You is a stunning collection of lo-fi jangle boy-crazy pop songs presented in a lushly upbeat manner, filled with enough sweet \"ooohs\" and \"ahhhs\" to give give you a sugar rush, harking back to the girl groups of the 50's and 60's, when the ladies stood up and proclaimed their undying affection for summer, and the love of their boyfriends.Of course back then the girls didn't play their own instruments, nor did they have tattoos ... what they do have in common is a passion for catchy tunes, hooks that unshakably float in your head, and songs that exist somewhere between disappointment, and the agony of life.  At 59, the numbers are a bit shallow, but then the days of peering over an open school locker door, or around the corner to catch a glimpse of the guys smoking at lunch, was a very long time ago.  Though in the same breath I must confess that the smile Best Coast has given me, reminds me how utterly brilliant life was, before things turned serious, and these silly emotions slipped between my fingers like so much summer sand.There's only one real sin you can commit, and that is to have forgotten what it was like to be young and in love ... luckily Crazy For You is out there to remind you.Review by Jenell Kesler\n", "val": 0.007110096514225006}
{"text": "Best Coast's Surf pop gem \"Crazy for You\" is a short and sweet album that just feels really good to listen to. The album uses its pop song mentality to strengthen its theme of obsession (i.e. the repetition), and goes from innocent longing for a guy to addressing the fact that she might actually be crazy for getting with him. If there is one fault to the album, it is having \"When I'm With You\" after \"Each and Every Day.\" The latter is just a perfect end to the album, and then the former comes in and ruins it. One way to remedy this is to place it in a different spot on the album in iTunes (or whatever else you use).

{"text": "Best Coast maybe in danger of losing their coveted reputation as the only group successfuly managing to translate; soppy pining, weed smoking, half baked lyricism into genuinely powerful art. Their latest album The Only Place suffered an indie backlash early this year and it's got a few people retrospectively thinking Crazy For You wasn't as effortlessy charming as they gave it credit for it 2010. Despite how retrograde this sounds, i can see why some may highlight the unexceptional elements of this album as being somehow more important in 2012. With the band seemingly unable to build on what they achieved here with follow up The Only Place, there's a strong impulse to throw the baby out with the bathwater.I'm proud to announce i'm still a Best Coaster though, as i'm in love with this amazing album perhaps even more now that im having to defend it's Neo slacker genius to a slew of haters and turncoats. I slightly jest about the extent of my ardency towards Crazy For You, but i do still really enjoy listening to this and for good reasons to. Bethany Costentino's voice is so sweet and honest on here not to mention pitch perfect. Her lyrics are as endearing as they are simple. The rhyming couplets lazy/crazy, prettier/skinnier and low/go have irked some who find them embarrasingly primitive but i just find them open hearted and lacking in pretension.The music on Crazy For You perfectly complements Costentino's voice to. Emphasising a more lo fi garage pop sound opposed to the overproduced sheen of The Only Place. The catchiness of all of these songs on here make it hard to pick favourites but \"I Want you\" finds a wonderful balance between Phil Spector's wall of sound pop and The Ramones early punk. And the scrappiness of \"Bratty B\"  and the Nirvanaesque distortion in \"Goodbye\" make Bethany sound like the most loveable 21st century Riot Grrl. Music this great should never be relegated to the guilty pleasure spot in anyones album collection, so i'm going to blast this a little louder in my flat from now on.\n", "val": 0.011071471497416496}

The album offers half an hour's worth of songs with simple, light lyrics and fun, catchy tunes that evoke feelings of relaxing summertime, nostalgia for youth, first crush/love.Some reviews have pointed out that the songs can be repetitive and feel as if they blend together. I enjoyed this album, but yes there's a degree of repetition. However listening to it the whole way through was very relaxing because of the way the songs flowed together and the lead singer's vocals. Alternatively, the album can be enjoyed by scattering a few songs into a playlist and put it on shuffle, because individually the songs are a blast.All in all, it's light listening good for relaxing or (non-club) dancing.

The guitars are loud, the sun shines and this is a summertime soundtrack.  At the same time, I have yet to connect with the songs.  The arrangements are all similar with similar tempos.

{"text": "I was introduced to Best Coast this winter, at the time all that was available were demos and one EP that sounded unfinished. I was pretty dismissive of it at the time, it sounded just like all the other lo-fi California bands getting endlessly hyped. This summer I heard \"Boyfriend\" the delightfully desperate single of Best Coast's first album, and I was hooked. I literally wore that track out, I probably listened to it 100 times the first week. It was sad and catchy and simple and just the best. When I listened to the full album Crazy For You, I was delighted to find that almost all the tracks sounded identical to Boyfriend. The whole album reads like a single chick's diary and it is awesome and embarrassing and feels honest and free from pretension.Every song on CFY washes over you, making it an easy album to listen to again and again. BC is influenced by the same 60s sound as She & Him, but their rough around the edges interpretation makes it all the more listenable. There's something about hearing Bethany Cosentino coo about smoking weed, and cuddling with cats that's totally refreshing and fun. As far as I'm concerned CFY is the soundtrack to the summer, and I have come to LOVE Best Coast even though Bethany is dating Nathan Williams ~_~.\n", "val": 0.026907948777079582}

I usually just download a song I really like instead of buying the complete album(I'm cheap that way) but I decided to gamble and pick up \"Crazy for you\". I can safely say I'm pleasantly surprised but not blown away by it. Best Coast is one of those bands that only do a couple things but they do them really well. The majority of \"Crazy for you\" consists of sort and sweet fuzzy pop songs about unrequited love. Singer/song writer Bethany Cosentino moans and coos about the one that got away or the one who doesn't understand her affections. She has a very haunting voice that sounds great with reverb. They have a very unique sound that can send chills down your spine. If you like shoe gaze, surf rock or self-deprecating love songs then Best Coast is for you.

{"text": "Rock music has always been dominated by men.  From Buddy Holly's pining for Peggy Sue to the libidinal poses of Jim Morrison, most rock and roll songs have been told from the perspective of those with a Y chromosome.  In fact, the masculine point of view has been so ingrained in rock and roll that when a woman wants into the tree house she has to prove that, like the rest of the guys, she can take just as many drugs and partake in just as much indiscriminant sex.  Janis Joplin, Grace Slick, and Joan Jett, to name a few, became rock and roll icons by asserting that whatever guys could do, they could do better.  The approach of what's-good-for-the-goose-is-even-better-for-the-gander has had its benefits, allowing women to break from roles traditionally created for them, but just as often it can serve to reinforce the whore/Madonna dichotomy that stretches back to long before Chuck Berry fashioned the first rock and roll song.With this, incomplete, history of women in rock music I've come to Best Coast's debut album, Crazy for You, with some trepidation.  Lead singer Bethany Cosentino has a penchant for writing songs about lounging and longing that stand in stark contrast to the pioneers of women in rock.  Instead of making lyrics like \"Take another little piece of my heart\" sound like a challenge, Cosentino sings as if she spent the entire album holding onto her paramour's pants legs as he strolled out the door.  On the opener, \"Boyfriend,\" she sings, \"I hope that he's at home / Waiting by his phone\"; later, on \"Goodbye,\" she croons \"Every time you leave this house / Everything falls apart\"; and, finally, on \"Bratty B,\" she pleads \"Pick up the phone / I wanna talk about how / I miss you so much.\"  It's not that there aren't plenty of examples of guys pining over girls in songs, but has there ever been an album with this much self-destructive longing?  Cosentino has avoided the whore and Madonna stereotypes only to fall firmly into the just as damaging archetype of the crazy girlfriend.The songs themselves are reasonably catchy throwbacks to early rock and 60s girl groups.  Like most musicians who trade in retro styles, Best Coast play up the difference between the pristine Leave it to Beaver image of the past the internet ravaged present.  For her part, Cosentino presents herself as stewing in a cloud of marijuana and codependence.  Likewise, much like some of those early pop songs, here the sentiments are as simple as the rhymes.  It would be tempting, then, to read Best Coast's mix of longing and dependence as a critique of those classic songs, revealing to the reader the kind of damage that music inflicted on the image of women.  The only problem with this take on Best Coast is that it's a complete misreading of some of the best girl group songs.  When Dionne Warwick sings \"Walk on by\" to her ex, she's asserting the fact that pain is temporary just as much as she concedes that she has spilled more than a few tears since he has left.  Cosentino concedes much more than she asserts, and I suppose your enjoyment of Crazy for You depends on how much time you've spent sitting by the phone waiting for the girl in Biology class to ring you up.\n", "val": 0.0016179116209968925}

You can barely tell what's going on in the music.  It's all fuzzy and tinny.  It sounds like they're playing under water.  Just awful.

{"text": "Look at the cover of this record. Look at the title of this record. Look at the name of the band. And hey, listen to this record, even. No, there's nothing new or unique about Best Coast and their debut record, Crazy For You. The record streamed in advance on Urban Outfitter's website; Bethany Cosentino, the gal who writes, sings and plays guitar in Best Coast, looks like an actor playing a rocker chick in a movie that would surely star Juno; and Bobb Bruno, Cosentino's partner in crime, looks like a million other California stoner dudes who play guitar and wear ironic T-shirts and glasses. The lyrics discuss important things like hanging out, boys, boredom, weed and summer fun throughout the record's 12 pop-rock cuts. It's gross. Seriously, this is a gross record. Even the irony-drenched cover brings the gags.Just kidding. I absolutely love Best Coast's debut record, Crazy For You, even if it seems like the most obvious summer indie record ever made. I like it because, unlike most of the hip records out this year, it's not a weird record. It sounds almost exactly like that band Girls (also from California), but with a girl singer and a whole lot more consistency. When describing the record to a friend, I said the following: \"No, no, shut up dude! Crazy For You reminds me of that first Strokes record - the one with the hand and the butt and the glove. No, dummy, it doesn't sound like the Strokes. Are you seriousl! LOL! I mean, they could tour together, but it doesn't sound like the Strokes. LOL! Mostly, it's just that it's a super obvious, been there/done that record that is too good to deny. Seriously, dude, you just gotta hear it a couple of times. It's like that band The Tyde, from a few years ago, but actually good. Or kind of like a sister to that new Wavves record.\"Said friend zoned out on me somewhere during the babble; I've not heard from him since. I figure he's either A) totally obsessed with Crazy For You; B) taking a break from our friendship; or C) scoping out AA programs and planning my intervention. Any way you look at it, I did my job. The dude has good taste, and will thus find his way to Best Coast one way or another because, make no mistake, Best Coast made a phenomenal first record. This is the sound of my summer, and surely many others - no shame in sight.I know what you're thinking - Dum Dum Girls. All Girl Summer Fun Band. Vivian Girls. Times New Viking. All that stuff. Nope, not this one. I've heard all those bands and all those records, and none compare to the fuzzy summer stoner anthems of Crazy For You. The ingredients are simple: imaginary girlfriend vocals; pseudo-surf vibes; Bill Murray and Thurston Moore as super fans; awesomely lazy riffs that echo and bounce; simple drum and bass that never gets in the way; four or more hooks per song; a whole lot a moments that will remind you of your favorite late-90s indie bands; and, of course, Cosentino, who is about as alluring as they come (fyi, I've never seen the girl, only heard her sing). There's also that whole laid-back California vibe, but nothing here really matters more than how many hooks and melodies Cosentino crams into this record. This is pop music. Very cool, very addicting pop music, not at all unlike that first Strokes record. Cut the fat; add some fuzz; nail the hooks; press record; repeat.You'll hear these songs in movies for years to come, no doubt. Indie rock high school boys will have a new crush and their girlfriends will have a new hero. This is the record that will be made into a T-shirt and pop up as a point of discussion in a movie starring Jonah Hill, Jesse Eisenberg or Scott Pilgrim. It's a better version of that pretty great Harlem record, Hippie, that got a lot of attention a few months ago. Seriously, as crazy as it sounds, this is a minor classic in the making, and deserving so.To recap: Juno; surfer/stoner; girlfriend vocals; hooks; Girls; California; fuzz; Bill Murray; and melodies. And that's about it. The lyrics aren't deep or complex (\"I want you soooo much\"; \"I'm happy / I'm happy / I'm happy / You make me happy\"; \"The world is lazy but you and me, we're just crazy / But when I'm with you, I have fun / When I'm with you, I have fun\" etc.), but they always work. And the playing is at all times about as simple as your least favorite local band. But somehow, this record just works. It's fun and easy and undeniable. Records like this don't come out often, not since The Ramones lost their touch. Yep, I'll admit it: I'm in love with Best Coast, even if this is the only record they ever make that's worth listening to, which is very likely.\n", "val": 0.00015063633327372372}

I have never listened to an album where I couldn't distinguish one song from the next. If I had to rank the songs, I would fail miserably. Adding on to that is the formulaic repetitiveness of their lyrics. I'm pretty sure every single song consists of choruses or hooks that repeat the same one or two lines at least four consecutive times before moving on to the next set of repeating lyrics. So overall, it's a fun summer record to play, but be prepared to zone out after the second song.\n", "val": 0.00017274626588914543}

But I started listening to the album out of curiosity and fell in love after the third listen.  I am at times reminded of Liz Phair.  Their voices are very similar, but the sound is incredibly different.  The themes are similar, some of it heartbreak, some of it fear, but I don't think Best Coast reaches the darkness Phair had in the early nineties.  Some songs like \"Honey\" have this very beautiful feeling of being covered in darkness, but what's surprising is that the message is positive.  She's in love, and she wants to be with someone all the time.There are other songs that have the feeling of being upbeat, but the lyrics prove otherwise.  \"I lost my job, I miss my mom, I wish my cat could talk...\"  But even in those moments of crumbling deterioration, Best Coast manages this very beautiful and upbeat tone.  Things are falling apart, but it only matters that she loves someone dearly and wants to be with them all the time.The album goes by fast.  You're enjoying one moment, and it's immediately replaced by another, and this is what makes me listen to the album on a constant basis.  I want to capture that same emotion before it goes to the next.This album isn't about complicated love.  It's upbeat and meant to be danced to, and I love it for those very reasons.

{"text": "Best Coast is an interesting mix. On one hand, you have these effervescent teenage girl type lyrics, straight from pop songs of the 60s (Bethany Cosentino notes she likes early Beatles better than post-65 Beatles, and I'd say the influence on this is indeed from the first half of that decade).  On the other hand, you have guitar tones and playing that sounds more like Sonic Youth or My Bloody Valentine in places.While this is called Surf Rock by the lazy press, it isn't in that vein at all - it's more like the Breeders or Liz Phair.

Michael Grimm said the way he got his soulful voice was by going through a few break-ups and living through tough times. They say you don't know a man until you walked a mile in his shoes.

An amazing singer. I'm happy to have found him -- and through AGT, of all places. I'm a big fan and will continue looking forward to hearing more from and about him.\n", "val": 0.03909889608621597}

I purchased this album after seeing him on this show but just found out that he had won a few minutes ago. Way to go Michael! You deserve it because you've got talent. This album exemplifies that.This album is the only one of Grimm's that I've have so far, having just discovered him, but he displays a very soulful repertoire on this collection. My favorites are \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\", \"You Got Me Hummin'\", \"Love and Happiness\" and \"Try A Little Tenderness\". If you discovered him through AGT like I did and enjoyed his performances then you'll enjoy this. A few of his selections for the show are on this album as well.Michael Grimm, looking forward to seeing more from you. Enjoy the win because you deserve it.

{"text": "This is a fine DVD, although anyone could argue about whether the contents are an \"ultimate\" collection.  I have my favorites, as I'm sure you do -- so no single compilation would ever satisfy everyone.  A couple of observations:  Generally, I would prefer if KJ NOT record songs already performed by other artists.  Doing so, invites an apples and oranges type of comparison.  Having said that, I believe her rendition of \"Nella Fantasia\" is the best I've heard.  Oddly, the same holds true of \"Music of the Night.\"  Though Webber wrote this for a male voice, I haven't heard one yet that does it justice.  Although KJ's version's orchestration lacks the original authenticity/punch that say Sarah Brightman's recording presents, KJ's mezzo soprano vocals are better equipped to handle the lower notes.  On the down side, \"Time to Say Goodbye\" is unbeatable by the Bocelli/Brightman duet.  \"Caruso\" is a signature song of Bocelli.  KJ does a great job with this, but, again, it only invites/instigates comparison.  \"I Could Have Danced All Night\" is owned by Julie Andrews.  \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\" is a flat effort by KJ, and cannot stand up to the renditions of Sarah Brightman or even Madonna.  Why?  Well, if I have one criticism of KJ it is that she simply cannot inject personal emotion/passion in any of her songs.  (Brightman and Madonna (for instance) have a long history of theatricality under their belts.  Perhaps KJ is still too young/inexperienced to feel comfortable surrendering to these impulses (if she has them).  I don't know.  She seems focused on technical perfection and unable (yet) to inject her own soul into the recordings.  I think she'll get to that point, but it might take awhile.  This is an apples/oranges comparison, but try to recall how Barbara Streisand (right out of the box) just allowed everything to flow from somewhere deep within.  It's not a lack of enthusiasm on the part of KJ, just (seemingly) an untapped ability to let herself go.  That criticism aside, I will nevertheless continue buying everything she releases, and I'll be carefully listening for any evolution.\n", "val": 0.0004559394728858024}

{"text": "Although Katherine Jenkins recorded six albums for Decca, this collection draws heavily on just three of them, these being&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Second-Nature/dp/B0002UJJRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Second Nature</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Living-A-Dream/dp/B000AD1IUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Living A Dream</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Serenade/dp/B000GWBO2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Serenade</a>. It would be fair to say that these were the albums that really established Katherine's reputation following her promising debut album, which isn't represented here at all.It's possible to argue what should have been included. The compilers had a hard job in selecting seventeen tracks that represent the best of Katherine's Decca music. No doubt the selection was influenced by the need to ensure that the album qualified for inclusion in the classical music charts, as all but one of her earlier albums did. This may explain the absence of Katherine's exquisite covers of We'll meet again, You'll never walk alone and Amazing grace, to name but three popular songs that I would like to have seen included. But I am pleased that Decca chose to include Don't cry for me Argentina. This was not included on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Living-A-Dream/dp/B000AD1IUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Living A Dream</a>&nbsp;, but it was included in a deluxe edition of the same album. I decided not to pay the premium price for just that track and one other. There's also a deluxe edition of this collection,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Katherine-Jenkins-The-Ultimate-Collection-Special-Edition/dp/B002MT2X5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Katherine Jenkins: The Ultimate Collection / Special Edition</a>, containing a second CD featuring eight live tracks, but again I opted for the standard edition.Whether this truly is the ultimate collection of her music, this compilation certainly provides a great introduction to the music of Katherine Jenkins.\n", "val": 3.8306705391732976e-05}
{"text": "Though I've never heard this Welsh mezzo soprano (?) perform before, I was immediately enthralled with her singing style.  However, I mainly bought this cd because of her rendition of the Dolly Parton hit \"I Will Always Love You.\"  What I absolutely hated was that Ms. Jenkins sang it in Italian or Spanish (?) which just ruined it for me.  I should have been performed in English only!  Why, either she or some European producer, thought it sounded more \"romantic\" to be sung they way she did completely messed up this rendition.  Dolly probably, upon hearing it performed by Ms. Jenkins, would be pleased.  But, Ms. Jenkins whenever you sing this song and if you do it here in the United States, sing it in English--Please!\n", "val": 3.129702963633463e-05}

But even having heard the Teenage Dream cover, I was still a bit reluctant to order an acoustic, original material album. And reluctant was a silly thing to be.Human is terrific. Criss makes some really interesting-- impressive-- vocal choices that really make it stand out from what you might expect from a singer/songwriter's first entry. I've listened to the EP twice since it arrived, and I feel that Criss' vocal delivery is really what sells it. There's a moment in the third track, \"Jealousy\", that, should you have gotten distracted with something else while the EP was playing, will--guaranteed-- steal back your attention and maybe leave you wide-eyed.\"Not Alone\" is definitely my favorite track on the EP. In fact, the preview of it was what convinced me to purchase the album.The opening (and title) track begins with the lyrics \"I feel like a loser,\" and I have a hard time imagining a single thought that's more human. From that point on, until the warm, musical-equivant-of-a-hug \"Not Alone,\" Criss delivers a work full of pathos.\n", "val": 0.016747694462537766}
{"text": "Darren Criss entered the public eye with his performance in the YouTube recording of A Very Potter Musical.  His charisma and talent brought a whole new level to the character of Harry Potter that worked wonderfully.  He wrote many of the songs featured in that show and has since written many other delightful tunes for shows performed by Team Starkid, the geniuses behind A Very Potter Musical.His debut CD is an excellent first effort and just oozes with the charisma that we have come to expect from Darren.  Purely acoustic, with excellent vocals, piano, and guitar, all performed by Darren himself who demonstrates remarkable multi-instrumental ability.  This has a raw feel, reflecting where Darren came from.  He recorded the entire album in his room with the help of an audio engineer friend.  There was no professional studio recording, no multitracks, no voice correction in post production.  It really feels as if we are sitting in a room with him as he plays.All the songs are original compositions, some sound familiar and others do not.  Fans will recognize \"Not Alone\" and \"Sami.\"  Both of these were used in A Very Potter Musical but were written by Darren before the show came into being, the love ballad \"Sami\" being altered slightly to become \"Harry,\" the song sang by Ginny Weasley to express her unrequited love for Harry Potter.  The other three songs are all new and equally entertaining to listen to.Overall, Darren Criss demonstrates remarkable musical talent and I think that, like Harry Potter himself, we can expect great things from him in the future.

{"text": "As a huge fan of \"Glee\", and of Darren Criss' character Blaine in particular, I finally got around to purchasing Darren Criss' CD \"Human\", which was his first CD of self-written material long before he was ever on \"Glee\". While I expected the material to be somewhat different from his usual repertoire on \"Glee\", I had no idea how different it would be, and that's definitely a good thing.Darren's songs are more \"folk\" than the usual pop that he does on \"Glee\" but they are sung with such soul delivery that the album could easily fit among the many current pop acts without looking out of place. \"Jealousy\" is a favorite and \"Not Alone\" is pure brilliance that doesn't need the inclusion of \"A Very Potter Musical\" to stand on its own. I highly recommend this CD to lovers of great soulful music, even if one isn't a fan of \"Glee\".The only drawback to this album is that there are only 5 songs on it. While the album's songs guarantee repeated listens, one feels it's only the tip of the iceberg to Darren Criss' brilliance as a songwriter and thus the listener is definitely left wanting more.While I definitely love Darren on \"Glee\", one drawback to his continued presence on the show will be that it won't afford him any time soon to do a follow up album. Hopefully that won't be the case much longer (not that I want his tenure on \"Glee\" to end any time soon).We need more Darren Criss!!!\n", "val": 0.003482494270429015}

{"text": "Before his star making roll on Glee, there was the 'magic' that is A Very Potter Musical and A Very Potter Sequel. And amidst all that, there is this self written, self performed, and self produced little gem. It showcases the true Darren Criss, as opposed to Darren Criss, who plays Blaine on Glee. The songs are very personal, for better or worse. Some of them are diamonds in the rough, and those alone make this album worth owning. Not to mention, it shows support for one of the most promising singer/songwriters in the up and coming music business. And so without further ado, my review of Darren Criss: Human.1). C - Darren Criss - Human - This is my least favorite song on the album. Not because of his vocals, which are fantastic, and the song is beautifully written. I think, honestly, it's the guitar. It just takes something from what could otherwise have been a powerful ballad.2). A - Darren Criss - Sami - Those of us who are A Very Potter Musical fans will recognize the beat and tune to the song Harry (What You're Doin' To Me) Somewhere out there is a woman named Sami who is forever immortalized in song. And is there any bigger compliment? The song is packed with beautiful hooks and heartfelt emotion. Possibly some of Darren Criss' best work.3). B+ - Darren Criss - Jealousy - This is a very true and real song, showcasing the awful way that jealousy can rear it's ugly head. Again, the vocals are beautiful. I think it's the guitar that just holds it back from being perfection. I hope one day he can redo some of these songs with more complete arrangements. I can just imagine it.4). B - Darren Criss - Don't You - This is such a soft beautiful song. Even the guitar by itself can't steal the emotion and soft, pure vocals that Darren brings to the song.5). A+ - Darren Criss - Not Alone - The best song on the album, bar none. Those of us who were fans of Darren before Glee will recognize yet another song from A Very Potter Musical. (Seriously, look that up on YouTube.) It's not just the most beautiful song on the album, but overall one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. This is songwriter gold here, and it's destined to be one of Darren's classics ten and twenty years from now when Darren is an even bigger star.  So okay, that's my two cents on Darren Criss' album Human. I give the overall album grade a solid A-. Not every song is perfect, but the ones that are, are so good that they elevate the rest of the album. If you're a Darren Criss fan, then this is a must have album for your collection. And if you're a Darren Criss lover but have never experienced Darren before Glee, then go look up A Very Potter Musical and A Very Potter Sequel on YouTube. Whether for the album or the YouTube works, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Thanks so much for your time folks.  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell\n", "val": 0.016176987439393997}

And in doing so she ushered the church into an intimacy with Christ that I had never experience before and now continually yearn for. When I listen to her CDs I can picture her on the keyboard, with her eyes closed, swaying a little and simply, intensely, and honestly worshiping Jesus in Spirit and in Truth.

{"text": "I had never heard of the name \"Rita Springer\", or familiarized myself with her music, until I heard her c.d \"Effortless\" playing during intermission at a large Christian concert that I attended this summer. I have never been compelled to make my way to the sound tech. and inquire about the artist that was coming from the speakers, but I couldn't leave this concert not knowing the name of this talented woman.The very fact that I am taking the time to write this review conveys how tremendously blessed I have been through Rita Springer operating in her gift of ministering through music. This c.d. is like the revealing of a personal journal - pouring out questions to God, relaying to Him the desire of wanting to be a surrendered vessel, being vunerable and receptive to His ways and outright confessing our confussion to His reasonings...while still believing in them.This is an orchenstrated c.d. in which you will have no doubt  that the holy spirit played an enormous part. You will feel lavished with love through such endearing worship and you will be in awe of how your intimate and private thoughts with God have manifested into songs that will have tears streaming down your face. You will absorb even more faith than you already possess while also being reminded that God's promises do indeed come into fruition.The very first song (WORTH IT ALL) is one that I replayed and replayed and replayed when I first got this c.d....\"I don't understand your ways, oh, but I will give you my song, I'll give you all of my praise. You hold on to all of my pain but with it you are pulling me closer - pulling me into your ways...\".Each and every single, solitary song will either have you feeling in the throne room of God, have your face on the carpet in your home, lifting your hands in your car on the way to work or simply playing it just to have the worship going in your home.It has been nearly 6 months since I purchased this c.d. and I still can't part with it to let even my own mother borrow it; I am going to have to buy her one of her own (which brings me onto AMAZON.COM in the first place!).The added benefit to this c.d., besides the lyrics and Rita Springer's amazing voice, is the quality of the product...it sounds live, not done with the background of one keyboard that has buttons to add the sound affects of drums, guitars, an organ, trumphets, etc.I recommend that you purchase \"Effortless\" and find yourself as blessed by it as I have been.\n", "val": 0.017181191593408585}
{"text": "What can I say? Rita Springer only improves each and every time I hear her. I am blessed to have had the opportunity to hear her sing a collection of these songs at a concert only a couple of days before this album's release. No recording can ever capture the intensity of hearing her live and in worship, but this one comes awfully close. Rita's music is supercharged with intimate, passionate lyrics that are a fast forward button for the spirit into the throne room of God. From her website, you can find that this album was recorded with an audience in the room, (unheard of course) worshipping with the music. Placing her in that atmosphere, the one her songs were created for, really shines through. The title song is a beautiful simplistic prayer, one that every worshipper should sing with her - \"May my praise be effortless. May my song come easily. May my worship be pleasing Lord to You.\" The melodies are more intricate and intimate this time around. Those that have heard her album \"All I have\" will find that hard to believe, but it's true.Rita lovingly and devotedly sings in the song \"Just to Know\" the beautiful lyrics: \"just to know that I am on Your mind....\" and once again, the listener feels like an intruder in a private conversation.\"The Joy of the Lord\" is energy packed and full of joy, while her cover of the Mercy Me song, \"I can only imagine\", will become the only version you ever hear in your mind again.If you are tired of industrial driven praise and long to hear worship that will inspire you to do just that - worship, Effortless is the only album you'll ever need to buy. But please check out her earlier works! Rita's music personally brought me back into intimacy with God after a long drawn out dry spell in my life. Noone can hear the impassioned love in her voice without being drawn into God's chambers right behind her. She truly sings for the Love of her life. Her music is the embodiment of worship in spirit and truth - and with a contrite heart. No ambition here, just power packed praise.For those of you longing for a more 80's sound in your music, her voice will bring back memories of Fleetwood Mac and other female 80's rockers. For those of you looking to go further into the throne room than most Christian labeled music takes you these days, take off your sandals and listen to Rita. It won't take but a moment to convince you that her praise is EFFORTLESS.\n", "val": 0.01632191240787506}

The quality of the recording is remarkably better than most concert albums. Mogwai's selection of songs here are great too, with works spanning their entire career. The only drawback in my opinion, is the absence of The Sun Smells Too Loud. A live version of that song would have been amazing.Burning (the DVD) is also exemplary, and unlike most concert films. It has a unique look for sure. Shot all in black and white, with dark shadowy performance footage and street scenes thrown in between songs. It's not unlike the film that was on the Hawk is Howling's bonus DVD. The only extra feature on the DVD is another performance of Mogwai Fear Satan, at another venue. The DVD's content runtime is only a little under an hour.The CD/DVD package also comes with an access code that allows the download of six bonus songs.This is a must-own for any Mogwai fan.

{"text": "This CD/DVD combo is nothing less than a present for Mogwai fans.  It's an absolutely brilliant live album (Special Moves) with an excellent concert DVD (Burning), and as a bonus 6 additional downloadable live tracks.The \"Burning\" DVD is shot entirely in black and white, sometimes grainy, sometimes very clear, showing a Mogwai concert in Brooklyn.  There are occasional shots of the city, and some takes of the (entranced) audience, but most of the movie focuses on the band on stage.  If you've seen Mogwai live, you know what to expect from their shows - and this movie portrays it in all its beauty.  For me the highlight of the DVD is a glorious version of \"Hunted by a Freak\".  There's also a blistering version of \"Mogwai Fear Satan\" that must have been something like a religious experience for the audience.  You'll only get a snipped of \"Like Herod\" in the DVD, but fear not as the entire 10 minute version can be heard on the CD.  If I have one minor complaint about the DVD, it's that it wasn't divided in DVD chapters, so it's impossible to skip forward or back to a specific song.  Not a big deal, but it would have been a nice touch.The \"Special Moves\" CD contains live versions of songs from almost all of the band's studio albums - there's nothing from the \"Zidane\" soundtrack or the \"Ten Rapid\" compilation, but every other album is represented.  If you take the DVD, CD and bonus tracks together, you'll find that song selection leans heavily towards the band's latest album \"The Hawk is Howling\", but since that's an excellent album I have absolutely no problem with this.  The audio quality is great.  I simply can't find anything wrong with this album, and although I own the \"Government Commissions\" live album, and there are tons of live performances by Mogwai on YouTube, I think I'll be coming back to \"Special Moves\" very often.To put the icing on the cake, you also get six additional downloadable tracks with this bundle.  At the time I write this, this CD/DVD combo plus 6 downloads is on sale for a grand total of $12.99 on Amazon (though the price may have changed by the time you read this).

There were a few reasons, one, it sounded nothing like I expected it to, two, there's so much going on it's easy to miss some of the layers this song has, and 3, the lyrics are a bit repetitive.  Having said that, this song grew on me, a lot! This isn't a song that you can listen to once and make a good judgment on, this song demands many listens.  Also, you want to make sure you listen to it with a decent set of headphones or speakers with a sub-woofer so that you can actually hear everything.  The first time I heard it was through the speakers of my laptop, which is not exactly the best way to listen to anything.  A lot of the song was lost on me listening through my laptop.  Next, I listened to it on some nice speakers and was floored.  Sounds and instruments that I didn't hear before, such as guitars and bass, jumped out at me and made the experience so much better. Now over 20 listens later, I absolutely love this song!For those of you that are apprehensive about the song, I just ask you clear your mind of what you think Linkin Park should sound like and listen to this with some good speakers and just experience it.  For those of you who want Nu-metal LP back, I'm just gonna ask you one question, how well did sticking to Nu-Metal turn out for Limp Bizkit? Are they relevant anymore? Didn't think so.  Good bands evolve, and that's what Linkin Park has done.\n", "val": 8.768675616011024e-05}

I know... it's really hard to put a description. (Yeah, they did that on purpose.) It might be something that you need to listen to a few times. Even though LP's music is always evolving, there are a couple things that you will find constant: deep lyrics and profound emotion. Their lyrics are universal, you can always relate to what they are saying. Chester's just got that emotion whenever he sings, you can feel it. As for this song, it sounds like that at times they have the rest of the band singing with Chester.

{"text": "The Catalyst by Linkin Park is...rather difficult to review. I am a massive fan of LP. But I'm used to stronger verses in all their songs and this song just seems to have missed that mark. While LP isn't planning on going back to their Hybrid Theory/Meteora style and that they are out for a new sound. The techno beat isn't that great, it's actually kind of annoying. I mean when you have a band like LP who can write and create songs like Breaking the Habit or Numb you expect more than something that any club DJ could make messing with a track (no offence to DJs). Now I'm not saying it's bad because it's not. It is a great song. The repetition is kind of annoying but after a few listens it's pretty good. But I still expected something else. Keep in mind this is just the 1st single off their new album, there are 14 more tracks to be heard. In conclusion, LP I love yah and I'll still be getting your new album in September and The Catalyst isn't what I anticipated but I like it anyway.\n", "val": 4.8280064220307395e-05}
{"text": "Arcade Fire has been mining the emotional turmoil of adolescence since its debut in 2004, and though the cause of that turmoil has once again changed, the message is, as always, the same. I'm not one of those people that thinks that everything Arcade Fire has done has been peerless and flawless: I think Arcade Fire is a good band that makes good albums with a handful of truly brilliant songs, nothing more and nothing less. The Suburbs is, as some of the song titles would suggest, a sprawling work, and not without its flaws, but there is plenty of reward for those willing to stick it out for the 60+ minutes. Perhaps working too tightly on the theme of \"the suburbs,\" the album has a tendency to be repetitive, which is not surprising given the album's length and the number of Part 1/Part 2 songs on the record. Though it suffers from some of the same problems like the Decemberists' bloated The Hazards of Love, namely strict adherence to a not entirely warranted theme, the Suburbs sets itself apart by having a number of truly excellent songs. Modern Man and Sprawl II are definitely among the best songs Arcade Fire have written, but having a propulsive drive that demands stomping in time with the beat and belting out the words. It should have been obvious all along that Arcade Fire was not going to top their (somewhat over-loved) debut, Funeral, but on the Suburbs, the band has stayed true to its sound and made the logical next step.\n", "val": 0.021256180480122566}
{"text": "I picked up an advance copy of The Arcade Fire's third album, The Suburbs, at the band's outstanding August 1, 2010 Boston show, at which the band premiered (in the US) eight of the new album's sixteen tracks.The Arcade Fire's first two albums, Funeral (2004) and Neon Bible (2007), amounted to a one-two punch that - like Radiohead's The Bends and OK Computer of a decade prior - were two of the best, if not the two very best, albums of the 00's.  The Arcade Fire's first two albums were unique in the way they wove dense, intricate, layers of (often dark) music, beautiful and emotional vocal harmonies, incorporation of strings as actual components of the songs (not something added after the fact), insightful and thought provoking lyrics (often in French; the band is based in Montreal), often addressing a young generation's grappling with coming of age, and featuring stadium ready anthems alongside beautiful ballads.Arcade Fire's music requires - and rewards -- repeated listening.  That makes a review of this new release somewhat difficult, because like a great wine, the band's music does not fully reveal itself on the first few listens.  With the foregoing caveat, I'll do the best I can, having now listened to the album several times, including on a pair of high quality headphones.  Indeed, the album sounds better on each listen.So what about The Suburbs?  As the title suggests, the album is something of a concept album about life in the suburbs, where the band members were raised.  But the band doesn't just look back; the band examines the present and looks forward (\"Sometimes I can't believe it; I'm moving past the feeling\"), being ready for children (\"I want a daughter while I'm still young\") and laments the loss of old friends (\"All my old friends they don't know me now\").Musically, the album is excellent, although, based on my initial listens, it does not strike me as being quite at the same level as the band's first two stellar albums.  The songwriting is once again first rate.  The music is not as dark or as dense (though it is still layered) as the band's earlier work.  This is a cleaner sounding, and more (indie) mainstream sounding Arcade Fire than its fans have previously heard (\"Half Light I,\" for example, reminds me of The Broken Bells and MGMT).  Moreover, there are no anthems here on the level of \"Wake Up\" or \"No Cars Go.\"  Having said that, once you get beyond comparisons with its predecessors, this album is a great listen, full of terrific and diverse songs that, as aforesaid, will repay repeated listening.  There are some excellent upbeat songs, such as \"Ready To Start,\" \"City With No Children\" and \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains),\" songs featuring atmospheric layers of sound, such as \"Rococo,\" and some beautiful ballads, such as the aforementioned \"Half Light I,\" \"Wasted Hours,\" \"Deep Blue,\" and \"We Used To Wait.\"  The vocal harmonies, featuring husband and wife Win Butler (who reminds me of David Byrne of The Talking Heads) and Regine Chassagne (her strongest album yet), on this new release are terrific, as is the musicianship.  Many songs flow into one another to create a seamless web of sound that really sets The Arcade Fire apart from its contemporaries.Incidentally, as reported on the band's website, this CD has been released with eight different covers; I believe that the artwork for each of the front covers is included in the CD booklet, which also features the album's handwritten lyrics.In sum, The Suburbs is an excellent album that, even if not quite at the stellar level of Funeral and Neon Bible, is a strong candidate for the best album of the year.\n", "val": 0.022556088864803314}
{"text": "The Arcade Fire is a band which is one of the best indie rock representitives these days. After especially acclaimed 'The Funeral' and yet no worse follow-up 'Neon Bible', 'The Suburbs' was very anticipated and predicted to be one of the best of the year. From the four pre-released songs one could say that the new record will be as same as different and surely as good as the previous gems.'The Suburbs' surprises and at the same time gently reminds how the band sounded before, as if the new record was just a continuum of their earlier work. However, 'The Suburbs' is quite a new direction of Arcade Fire if to compare in deeper analysis than the general sound. While the last record 'Neon Bible' was foggy and intense, rough and experimental, 'The Suburbs' in comparison is lighter and easier to get on with. As it goes with the cover of the album, this album is more of a cloudless and warm day and no ocean of noise is round the corner.  Yet if to be true, 'The Suburbs' has its own melancholy moments.The album has a length of one hour which is more than ten minutes longer than each of the other albums. However, to be honest this album went through lot quicker than 'Neon Bible' did. The songs are at the right length, the music flows and it is just your bussiness to catch up with.Even though 'The Suburbs' have a little bit more pop tunes, more woman vocals than ever, sometimes even a choir-like sound, but the album stays on track and does not lose its style and whatever you like the most about the Arcade Fire. All in all, I believe that the Arcade Fire produced another very solid album which should not let any fans down and, whatsoever, tame many more.Key tracks:- The Suburbs- Rococo- Half Light I- We Used To Wait- Sprawl II\n", "val": 0.017096981406211853}
{"text": "Arcade Fire burst onto the scene in 2004 with their debut album, Funeral.  Their grandiose indie anthems earned them glowing praise from critics and fans alike.  With Win Butler leading on vocals and guitar, Arcade Fire's eclectic instrumentation and apparent influences, including David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, Radiohead, and Neil Young, made them stand out from the countless indie bands getting their start at the same time.Recording their second album in a church, Neon Bible utilized a pipe organ, full orchestra and military choir to expand their sound even further.  Although the mood of Neon Bible was much darker than the soul cleansing shouts of hope that burst through the depression on the surface of Funeral, Arcade Fire proved they were much more than a one off talent.  A packed tour schedule consumed the band's time until early 2008 when the members decided to take a break, playing a few free shows later in the year in support of Barack Obama's presidential candidacy, but ultimately staying out of the public eye.Now, two years later, Arcade Fire is finally back with one of the most anticipated albums of 2010.  Their third record opens with the title track, \"The Suburbs,\" which finds Arcade Fire in significantly lighter spirits than their previous two records.  The same band looking for an escape from the pains of life realized in their earlier years is now beginning to accept the conformity of suburbia with a new goal of providing their children with the best experiences life has to offer, safe from the agony they had to work through.There is still, however, an internal conflict hidden within the band's acceptance of The Suburbs.  On \"Ready To Start,\" an energetic verse proclaiming \"I would rather be wrong than live in the shadows of your song\" shows the classic break-away mindset of Arcade Fire shining through while the following track, \"Modern Man,\" brings the pace back down to the mid-tempo groove and finds Win Butler repeating \"I'm a modern man\" as if he's trying to convince the listener of something he doesn't quite believe himself yet.  The musical mood swings continue as laid back tracks like \"Rococo\" and \"Wasted Hours\" are given \"Empty Room\" and \"Month of May,\" two of the most animated tracks on the album, as neighbors.  Although, on first listen, this pitting of tunes against each other may cause the album to seem sporadic, on further listens, the sheer genius of the track ordering and songwriting as a whole rings out.The apex of the album occurs during \"Suburban War.\"  The realization of inevitable maturity begins to be accepted as Butler's earlier cry of \"I would rather be wrong than live in the shadows of your song\" becomes \"I've been living in the shadows of your song.\"  The truth comes out, denial becomes acceptance and the song's tempo doubles as the line \"all my old friends, they don't know me now\" is hauntingly repeated.The Suburbs finds Arcade Fire taking a longing look at the naivety of their youth while looking forward to what the future holds.  Where their first two albums leaned heavily on stand out singles like \"Wake Up,\" \"Rebellion,\" \"Keep the Car Running,\" and \"Intervention,\" The Suburbs is much more of a complete work meant to be taken in as a single, hour long journey between adolescence and adulthood.  Longtime fans of Arcade Fire will always hold Funeral on a pedestal, untouchable by future releases, but just as children often grimace at being compared to their parents, The Suburbs is a masterpiece worthy of such an analogy.Similar Artists:  Talking Heads, PixiesTrack Suggestion:  \"Suburban War\"\n", "val": 0.009554782882332802}
{"text": "For album number three, Arcade Fire sound joyous and melodic with a slight retro feel. 16 tracks long, the first few songs have a warm familiar feel; the jangly title track (reprised at the end in a brief haunting drone), the sunny \"Ready to start\", or \"Modern man\" with slightly askew beats. Win Butler handles most of the lead vocals on the album.The two part \"Half light\" (\"I need the darkness, can you please cut the lights?\" go the lyrics in part) is where things start to veer off in different directions; the first part a tender string-swathed ballad, the second \"No celebration\" a pulsing Synth-driven affair. \"Suburban war\" is a jangly tempo-shifting cinematic piece with haunting harmonies, while \"Month of May\" is frenetic Punk, a watershed of sorts.The Beatles-esque \"Deep blue\" has a plodding gait with ethereal vocals, while \"Sprawl\" is a two part epic; the first \"Flatland\" a Morricone-style dramatic ballad with Win turning in a melodramatic croon (absolutely stunning), and the second \"Mountains beyond mountains\" an upbeat ABBA Disco-style ditty with Rgine Chassagne on vocals.\"The suburbs\" is an enthralling album, better taken as one piece with various movements, as unlike its predecessors, there aren't really any obvious standouts like \"Wake up\" (from \"Funeral\") or \"Ocean of noise\" (from \"Neon bible\").

{"text": "\"The Suburbs\" is Arcade Fire's much acclaimed third album. It's a relatively long album, which plays for about one hour; so it may take some time to get a good overview of the music.If you got the grip of the very exciting debut album \"Funeral\", you should be likely to enjoy more music in the same genre. It can be difficult to describe the music in few words, but groups like Velvet Underground and Talking Heads must be among the inspiration sources. The sound may seem a bit scratched at times, but the numbers are quite varied, ranging from the very melodic to the noisy and punked.An important prerequisite for being able to keep Arcade Four right, I think, is that you appreciate the two singers of the group, of whom Win Butler obviously is the most important one. The female voice, R&eacute;gine Chassagne, may appear a little flimsy, but she also possesses a speciality that some will enjoy and others dislike. Personally, I'm a fan of both of them, especially when they deal with melodic songs with the group; On this album one could highlight \"Half Light\", \"Suburban War\", \"Deep Blue\", \"We Used to Wait\" and \"Sprawl II\".In general, you might say that Arcade Fire is a group that sets certain demands for its listeners; Not much easy listening here.\n", "val": 0.0028395275585353374}

{"text": "The Suburbs (2010) is an original and inventive record that delivers both musically and lyrically, examining themes such as memory, change, alienation, bohemia, and of course, suburbia. The result is one of the most engrossing records of the last decade or so.Dreamt I drove home to Houston on a highway that was underground / There was no light that we could see as we listened to the sound of the engine failing, Win Butler sings in City With No Children, a song that reflects on returning, going back, seeing what has changed. You can almost see The Woodlands Mall illuminated at night as you hear the tune. But I think even more than nostalgia or reflection, there are many philosophical tropes in the album, some of which deal with how society unconsciously (or consciously) stunts intellectual growth or artistic expression, revealed in some lyrics taking on institutions (bosses, the police, etc.). You hear this in Sprawl I: Cops shown their lights/ On the reflectors of our bikes/ Said do you kids know what time it is? / Well sir, its the first time Ive felt like something is mine / Like I have something to give, and also in Sprawl II: They heard me seeing and they told me to stop / Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock. These are deep songs, challenging what our institutions often tell us: don't think, go to bed; don't sing, work. If you think you are an artist, you're pretentious, arrogant, weird, etc. Be like everyone else.This is why Arcade Fire is, dare I sayalternative.Moreover, there are many other gems: the beautiful coda of Half Light I, the ethereal mixture of classical music with rock in Empty Room, the criticism of coffee shop intellectuals in Rococo, the traces of Joy Division/New Order in Half Light II, the wistful elegance of Suburban War, and of course, Month of May, where its almost impossible not to smile at the coolness of Win Butler saying, We were shocked in the suburbs. I mean, this is just good music.This album, which is more like one long song divided up into various parts, concludes appropriately with Butlers dirge in The Suburbs (continued): If I could have it back / all the time that we wasted / Id only waste it again. After all, its only when you are wasting time that you come up with some good ideas, not when you're trapped in your cubicle or office, worried about the next deadline.Waste some time and listen to this record.

{"text": "Arcade Fire, the alternative rock act from Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada, released, what probably is one of the most celebrated albums of their short-time career since Funeral  and, at the same time, the most awarded of all, since they won the 2010 Grammy Awards as Best International Album. Unlike Funeral, The Suburbs seems to have a very optimistic, happy mood. On the other hand, Win Butler, Arcade Fire's bandleader said : the album itself is not aimed to be regarded as a love letter, nor an indictment of the suburbs. It is a letter from the suburbs. According to Butler, the album is a mix of Depche Mode and Neil Young. So, bearing these comments in mind, this album is certainly weird and original, not the usual disc you may find out somewhere at any record store. Highlights to consider on this album:  the title track, Ready to Start, Modern Man, Rococo, Empty Room, City With No Children, Half Light I and II, Month of May, Sprawl I and II and Suburban War.

Two main issues I have with it.  1) the recording/mastering/whatever just doesn't sound that great on vinyl.  It's kind of muddy.  2) and this is the bigger issue, twice in a row I've gotten defective vinyl.  The first order came through with one of the platters warped - warped enough to hear the pitch variations in playback.  Amazon of course handled the exchange flawlessly and I had a replacement sent to my door by 1-day delivery.  The replacement isn't warped.  It's flat as a pancake.  Unfortunately, side 2 of the 2nd LP was pressed so far off-center that there's huge wow & flutter pitch variations during playback.  It's unlistenable.Merge Records, get with the program!  It's 2013.  The techniques for properly pressing vinyl records should be well-understood by now.  Granted, getting a warped record may not be a manufacturing issue.  Could have been shipped/stored improperly, whatever.  But an off-center pressing is definitely a manufacturing issue.I've ordered a bunch of vinyl from Amazon in the last few weeks and the only records I've had problems with have been on Merge (the other was Kaputt by Destroyer - also arrived badly warped and had to be returned.  Thankfully, the replacement album was defect-free).I think this time I'll return the LP for refund rather than exchange.  If it was a great recording I'd try again but this recording, as pressed, doesn't really allow the full glory of vinyl to shine.  I'd say stick with the CD or digital download for this album.

{"text": "From the catchy intro of The Suburbs down to the final beat of its continuing tune, The Suburbs tells a story very close to many of our hearts. Its a story of growing up and feeling like you somehow lost a part of yourself. That thing you loved when you were a kid. That friend from down the street. The family member who never comes around anymore. We all have something that we once loved that's gone and we all have a growing up story. As painful as the process might be, we all have to grow up eventually. But, by the time we stop and look back at the past, we find that we really aren't that far off from where we started. There's a little part of us that can't be lost, even as everything around us is shifting.The album is a great complete work. It's not just a collection of songs that sound great, it really is a complete work. Each song seamlessly blends into the next and the lyrics and the melodies seem to fade right into each other.

The theme of growing up is a very relatable one, and each song does it's part to help enforce it. Although they are \"slower\" songs, they are still just as enjoyable as anything on their previous CDs. Some of my favorites are \"Sprawl I\" and \"The Suburbs (Cont.)\" just because of the emotional value of them.One addition to this is that I got the Special Edition from Amazon instead of just a normal version, which was quite a nice surprise. It comes with 2 additional songs (\"Culture War\" and \"Speaking in Tongues\") plus a short film called \"Scenes From the Suburbs.\" The 2 songs are alright, but I can see why they didn't make it onto the vanilla version of the album. As for the short film, it is really well made. I really enjoy the dialogue of the kids, because it reminds me a lot of how my friends and I talk (myself being 17). One funny thing about it is Win's acting. When they ride by him as a police officer, he says his line kind of funny.

The album's opening song and the one that gives it its name, The Suburbs, is incredibly catchy, with a happy beat, but somewhat regretful lyrics of the days of yore. It then flows perfectly into Ready to Start, an energetic piece that caught my attention, causing me to buy this album two years ago. It's that good. After that, the songs flow seamlessly into one another, weaving a story of teenagers living in a passionless city at war. Month of May, then comes along just about forcing you to get up and flail your limbs around. We Used to Wait, the album's second radio hit, is arguably the best song on the album, with perfectly woven instrumentals, nostalgic lyrics, and an energy build that you can't help, but join into. despite how I highlighted just those few songs, every single song on this album is nothing short from amazing.

As with their other albums Neon Bible and Funeral, The Suburbs is thematic and a collective experience. The songs belong together like pieces of a puzzle and their arrangement is a story with a beginning and an end. Actually you could even say some songs are paired up like two different characters in the same scene but from unique perspectives. For example, in Sprawl I (Flatlands), Win seems to express a moment in time from a very somber point of view, while Regine sings Sprawl II (Mountains beyond Mountains) with ethereal lightness -- though deceptively so, because the lyrics are still on one level about running into cops on the street and on another, about existential crisis. This band is awesome, this album raised the bar for musical releases that had degenerated into disjointed MP3 singles, and the members of this group are very committed to good causes -- consistently raising money and awareness for those suffering in Haiti still from a terrible earthquake that happened only a few years back.

It's unfortunate that the weakest of the 3 full length Arcade Fire albums is the one that wins the Grammy.  It rather feels like a make-up award (like Whoopi Goldberg getting the Oscar for 'Ghost', clearly a make-up award for having screwed up by not giving her the Oscar for 'The Color Purple').  'Neon Bible' was a better album than this and 'Funeral' was better than 'Neon Bible' and the Grammy voters eventually realized they seriously blew it by not even putting either of the first two albums up for the award, so they tried to make up for it by handing one out for 'The Suburbs'.\n", "val": 0.00025198899675160646}

Put simply, I do not need deep and introspective lyrics and composition from my music, I only want to be entertained.This changed for me when I began dating a new girl that was in love with Arcade Fire and listened to it constantly. Like most guys, I initially just tuned out the music of the GF, and blasted my own music the second I left her place. This went on for some time until I eventually started paying attention to it. As much as the \"typical guy\" in my wanted to hate it out of pure principle, I began to find myself hanging up on the various songs and lyrics.After about 2 months, I downloaded the album from Itunes and I have been secretly enjoying it even since. To this day, the GF still does not realize it.I am obviously no musical prude, so I can't really comment on why I find the album so compelling, but even if I did come up with some colorful adjectives to describe the album, it would not really make much sense to anyone else besides me.It is crafted in a way that defies what I previously considered to be \"good music\".

I realized this is probably one of my favorite albums ever.  Here's why;1. The songs are still deep and dynamic. Not as balanced as on Funeral but better than Neon Bible without a doubt.2. The songs have that awesome 80's feel that all the indie bands try to emulate but here it's done right.More specifically that E.T. when atari was cool feeling, but not in a cheesy 80's way. In an organic non commercial way.(this is one of the things it took me awhile to realize. with the first listen I didn't notice).3. Rgine Chassagne sings more on this CD.4. The album has eccentric, and \"want to go look that up\" lyrics. The best kind. Sprawl anyone.? Another thing I overlooked.5. The singles are actually good without being over the top. I really don't like AS MUCH by them by themselves but withthe whole album they fit perfectly.6. This album is great on a long drive.IN A MORE TANGIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE WAY I FELL LIKE THIS ALBUM IS JUST AS GOOD AS FUNERAL.\n", "val": 0.0346052385866642}

I also bought their first studio album 'Funeral' which is also definitely worth checking out!Arcade Fire's \"The Suburbs\" is wonderful, I would recommend it to anyone.

This is my first Arcade Fire album, but it won't be the last.  This album moves me in ways I haven't been moved before, and I hope that as I continue to explore Arcade Fire's discography that I will continue to experience this.The film \"The Suburbs\" adds to the mood of the suburbs and gives the viewer a greater feel for the album.  Not the best film because it leaves so much up to the viewer, but it is still very interesting and was made to be a piece of art the same way that Arcade Fire's music is.I would recommend this album to my family and friends.\n", "val": 0.03743409365415573}

{"text": "Arcade Fire is a band that grew on me quickly and like a wildfire in a windstorm, I was enthralled by their music. The band, which consists of anywhere from 6-11 people create a complex and unique sound that fit the indie and main stream well. Where they haven't made it fully into the mainstream (and I hope they never do) they still have a massive following.I first discovered their music about 2 years ago while I was perusing some indie bands and their counterparts. I heard a few songs and was instantly a fan. Their newest album which came out August 3 is another amazing album and this time around they decided to try a bit of a more of a themed album.The Suburbs gives us a range of songs from acoustic to punk to disco to techno. The disco style as well as the techno are not your normal styles they are entirely Arcade Fire and work so well.The shifts in this album from one style to the next gives you no room for stagnation.Like all albums from even my favorite bands it takes me usually about 2 listens to for me to enjoy it and about 4 times for me to love. This album is on par with that standard. The first time through i was soaking in all of the differences from their other 2 albums. The second time i am getting used to the lyrics, the melodies and the overall arc of the album. listens 3 and 4 are pure enjoyment and the embrace of the changes and the memorization of the lyrics so when in the shower I find myself humming or singing the lyrics.This album is phenomenal, like their other 2 it's stride is its own and to try and compare it to another one of their albums cannot be done.The CD is very generic and the packaging is cardboard and the CD and lyrics slips in like many newer albums. The Lyric booklet is cool because all the lyrics are all hand written so it gives you a sense of closeness. The photos are very cool because they all look old school from the 60's or 70's.If you have not heard of Arcade Fire before here is a song off the new album and if you have heard of them, please listen to this album.\n", "val": 0.01944592408835888}

It's mind-blowing how many things are going on that are all tucked into the mix in endless places. These details get lost during passive, background listening. It is sonically so appealing it tends to pull you in. I love how all the instruments sound on this record! And the songwriting is just stellar. Devestatingly melancholy. Very dark. But real. These songs all tap into really specific emotions that are hard to describe but you know when you feel them. I mean this album really is a masterpiece. I didn't understand why it was getting so much praise initially. Like some others, I thought it was rather boring the first couple of listens. But I've had that happen many times with phenominal recordings. It's like they're too brilliant or deeply emotional that my brain just doesn't register it at first.

{"text": "I'm not sure what it is about this album I can't shake. I became a big Arcade Fire fan with Neon Bible and bought Funeral after they started playing \"wake up\" for the movie Where the Wild Things Are. As much as I love wake up, the rest of the album just blurred into one forgettable song after another. When Suburbs came out I was luke warm and as much as I loved Neon Bible I was worried Suburbs would be a disappointment like Funeral. After the first listen I decided it was just another OK album from Arcade fire. And then I listened to it again on a long commute between states to a new job in New Hampshire and was struck by how sad the last song was leading back into the first track \"The Suburbs\".Several long commutes later, the Suburbs has become one of my favorite albums. There is just something sad and beautiful about every track on this album that after so many times listening it has become my favorite of Arcade Fire's albums. How often do you reach the end of listening to a full album and the CD player wraps around to the first track and you actually smile when you hear the first track start again?Favorite tracks: The Suburbs, Ready to Start, Half Light (both), Month of May, Sprawl (mountains beyond mountains)\n", "val": 0.0007074839668348432}

{"text": "First of all, I stand by my previous review:[amazon won't let me hyperlink but you can find it under the original edition]I still think the album works best at a standard LP length of 45 minutes. That said, the deluxe version adds two new songs which both add to the story. Now the album has enough material for a traditional ~75 minute double-LP and I think it works well as one, but only after some of the tracks are shuffled around. Try this running order on for size:1. The Suburbs2. Ready to Start3. Modern Man6. City With No Children--5. Empty Room4. Rococo17. Culture War15. Sprawl II16. The Suburbs Continued----10. Month of May18. Speaking in Tongues12. Deep Blue13. We Used to Wait--14. Sprawl I9. Suburban War11. Wasted Hours8. Half Life II (to me a better climax than Sprawl II)7. Half Life IMy other frustration with the album is with the mastering. I understand the whole loudness war thing and why the original album was mastered the way it was, but I wish a different mastering were used for this version, something with more dynamic range. The sound ends up being a bit muddy which I think is a shame because this is one of the few socially important albums to be released in the last five years. It really deserves to be heard (and now with the video features, seen) and the sound quality will turn some people off.In summary, if you are an Arcade Fire fan, discard the original CD in favor of this version.

{"text": "After listening to this wonderful, perfect album many times, it finally clicked with me and I realized it's genius.The album's suburbs theme is simply an apt context; what 'suburbs' is really about is the feeling one may have of wistful, nostalgic reflection of one's past in a transcendence into maturity.  The album underscores a pining for things in our past that never will be again.It does this quite perfectly both lyrically and musically and emotionally, something akin to magic in my book.  Some key tracks that resonate with this sense of nostalgic reflection, 'we used to wait', 'modern man', 'suburban war', 'sprawl I' and 'sprawl II'.Sprawl I, a track that made me cry once I actually really listened to it, struck a chord in me to which I could relate on a deeply personal level. It is about kids' search to find the house in which they grew up, only discovering that the house and playgrounds are not there anymore- they had been consumed to obscurity by modern development.  The song underscores the search and longing to go back to that place and time and it's very sad.Sprawl II, somewhat reprises this theme and bookends the entire album, with 'Living in the sprawl dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains and there's no end in sight I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights'.  Powerful! and also cathartic.The album weaves a tapestry that sounds strangely familiar and retro.  The sporadic and sometimes silly synth conjures an 80s-era feeling re-imagined. I can't put my finger on it but it makes me think of 'the Cars'  Bruce Springsteen and others of that time.\n", "val": 0.029350170865654945}

Neon Bible disappointed me at first but it grew on me and now I really enjoy it. The Suburbs has the same diversity, mood changes, and smart lyrics as its predecessors but it drags a bit and would have been just as good as their first two albums if a few songs were left off. As for the highlights, there are many. The opening title track brings things off to a rollicking start while \"Ready to Start\" is a strong rocker with a great lyric and the keyboards adding a lot of color during the chorus. \"Modern Man\" has an oft-kilter rhythm that works well while the excellent \"Suburban War\" has a great hook in its guitar line which stays present throughout as the song changes in both tempo and drama. \"City with No Children\" is both serious and catchy while \"Month of May\" is frantic, kinetic, and catchy all at once.  Other strong tracks include the dramatic \"Deep Blue\" and the danceable \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\". The rest of the tracks are good but \"We Used to Wait\", \"Sprawl I (Flatland)\" and both of the \"Half Light\" tracks drag the album's momentum down.

I then listened to the whole album sometime later during a outside jog one evening. I can say I like about every track on the album.Of course, it is already recognized that Arcade Fire's music is experimental and different genres can be heard in their music. Of course you hear music influences in this album(e.g. Bruce Springsteen). What modern music bands of today are NOT influenced by past musicians/artists?I will admit that I never bought or even listened to this band's previous album since buying their album \"Funeral\" 5 years ago. I've always been aware of the album \"Neon Bible\" existed but I've never listened to it. I did buy and listen to \"Funeral\" plenty of times over the past 5 years.Arcade Fire is one of those low-key \"needle in the haystack\" bands....well, at least in the city where *I* live. Anyway, this is music that is not thrown in anyone's face and like most indie music, this is music you have to search for and approach all on your own without anyone else's opinion or influence.

Since I'm known as the \"Music Obsessed\" in my group of friends, I took it upon myself to hear this album for myself and report it back to them. Big mistake.The vocals are so whiny, the singer named Win (more like Fail!) constantly sounds like he is on the verge of tears. Cheer up, man... it might be hard to, though, since your band is so terrible. There are like seven members in the Arcade Fire, some I believe are multi-instrumentalists, which is weird since all of the music sounds like something you'd expect from a beginner.

{"text": "This album gives the feeling of the Beatles' Abbey Road album. Emotionally not as powerful as Funeral, but the pieces are constructed amazingly well to create a different kind of uniqueness. But, what made the Arcade Fire unique is still there. Subtle shaped melodies, strong beats integrated into soft pieces to create a striking and balanced flow. Repeating the same structure over and over again, each time with a different melody. Occasionally presenting the listener with strongly captivating tunes, in, for instance, Ready to Start (the synth seduction) and Suburban War (the drum seduction).For an album, rating may refer to a lot of different things.

{"text": "It starts with a deceptively simple sounding song but soon it floats into a haunting, dream-like chorus. After multiple listens, tiny details emerge revealing that there is a lot going on beneath the surface of the music, indeed this is one of the themes explored within the album. \"At night the feelings swim to the surface.\" Small, suburban towns that appear grey and bleak at a glance conceal another world, take a closer look across the green lawns and faceless houses, something sits in the dirt and shines like a shard of broken glass, glinting. In the suburbs, past the wood-polished floors and vacuous lives, past the animal bones and yellow flowers and into the sunlight, there is a tiny glimmer of something like hope.The listener is invited to \"Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving...\" and (to me at least) the journey through The Suburbs does feel like driving a stolen car through empty streets, surrounded by grey neighbourhoods, in a town with shuttered windows and swaying trees, slowly engulfed in sweeping whirlwinds of decayed leaves. On many of the tracks there is a huge swirling sound that moves through the songs like a living thing and makes you wonder, what is that sound, what does it represent? Empty Rooms has the sound almost as a constant, whilst during Ready To Start it appears then disappears, only to reappear near the end, a lonely sound, like wind through trees on a hot, July afternoon.Modern Man, with its almost rockabilly sensiblity, features strange, subtle, off-kilter rhythms and builds to a beautiful guitar led climax, it sounds so simple yet there are many complex harmonics at play and some wonderful ghost-like chords that seem to float and glide, almost in the background but if you listen closely, they can be heard throughout the song.Amidst what sounds like banks of synthesizers, we are informed of someone (the eternal outsider) being told to \"Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock...\" during the euphoric Sprawl Part II (Mountains Beyond Mountains) and yet, beneath its dark, electronic surface, Sprawl is joyfuly defiant in its celebration of life, clear in the line, \"We rode our bikes to the nearest park, sat under the swings and kissed in the dark.\" There is also a call for peace here, a yearning amongst the garish shopping malls, the security cameras and busy city streets. A yearning for cool, quiet nights, a place far away from the shimmering neon lights, for a room where the wind blows a curtain through an open window and the moon sits remote in a pitch black sky, a need for darkness and the serenity found in solitude because sometimes the loneliness is not aching, sometimes it is a wonderful bliss where feelings really can \"swim to the surface.\"The Suburbs is a definite slow burner but repeated listens are rewarding (and essential) on an album so panoramic in scope, so colourful and deep, like looking at woodland at midnight with the wind swirling around you and ahead, all you can see, are mountains beyond mountains.\n", "val": 0.009919075295329094}
{"text": "Arcade Fire are one of the most important bands to me. \"Funeral\" is one of my favorite albums of last decade, and while their followup \"Neon Bible\" wasn't QUITE up where \"Funeral\" was, it was still pretty freaking incredible. All together, two of the best \"indie\" albums out there. So needless to say, I was pretty excited upon the announcement of \"The Suburbs\". I just wondered how this band would get MORE epic, MORE grandiose, MORE anthemic. They certainly have those 3 traits on this new release, however the album isn't really clicking with me.This album is the band's first concept album, and the concept can be summed up to, basically the most dark, melancholic depiction of The Suburbs, to the point that it's depressing. And this is where my issues with the record come in; every time I hear this, or read the lyrics, I have to ask \"Arcade Fire, why are you so sad? Why?\" At least back on their first 2 albums, with songs like \"Wake Up\", they could write depressing, melancholic songs without making them SEEM that depressing or melancholic. This band has always been moody, just not to this extent. To sum it up, if you're not into the concept of this record, you probably won't really click with the record like I didn't, because this album is deep into this concept.But this album is certainly not without some great standouts. The radio single \"Ready to Start\" and \"Month of May\" are considerably faster and more energetic than most of the other tracks, and are a welcome shift from the down feeling of the album. Also, \"Empty Room\" brings back the operatic, grandiose sound of \"Neon Bible\". Even a couple of the moodier tracks, like \"Half Light I\" caught my ear. And let's not forget \"Sprawl II\", one of the most acclaimed songs on here, and rightfully so. It's a great song, my favorite on this album, and honestly one of my favorite AF songs. Rgine Chassagne's vocals always floor me, whether it be this track, \"In the Backseat\" from Funeral, \"Black Wave-Bad Vibrations\" from Neon Bible, etc. She is always a welcome presence in the band.Overall, this is not a bad album by any means. I just think the concept sorta stood in the way of the creativity and magic of AF's other material. Clearly I'm the minority here, as this is one of the most acclaimed albums of 2010. So if you're an Arcade Fire fan, you should've already checked this out, and if you're looking into starting to listen to this band, I'd recommend starting from the beginning, Funeral, and working your way through their 3 albums.\n", "val": 0.024994736537337303}

I was excited when The Neon Bible came out, and when I heard it, I was on the floor.Unfortunately The Suburbs is boring and uninspired in comparison here. There's about maybe 3 songs on here that of worthy of listening to over and over, and the rest is all repetitive. I swear after track 2 I was wondering if my vinyl copy was broken/problematic, because it's so damned repetitive. Almost all the tracks have the same pattern of \"start off slow/start music about a minute in/delay vocals 30 seconds after/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus/verse/chorus/long end\".

{"text": "After waiting several years for the next release for the stunning Canadian indie group, Arcade Fire, The Suburbs landed in my hands. I immediately started listening to their latest, and was drawn into this beautiful world this group has crafted with their latest effort. I was enthralled with each and every song to some degree, and was immediately left wantin the next CD released already! Also, I was greately pleased with the length. Most artists are releasing CDs under 45 minutes. This CD is 63 minutes long. Yes, Arcade Fire fans, over an HOUR of a wonderful experience.The Suburbs - (7/10) - At first listen, I was rather skeptical of where this was going, but I've been listening to it more and more, and its rooting its way into my head bit by bit. I find myself tapping my feet to the fun rhythym, and humming along.Ready to Start - (9/10) - In a word, stunning. This song takes what The Suburbs started, carries on right from the end from a happy tune to a more dark and powerful song. It holds a wonderful musical scape on its own, the lyrics are fascinating, and the voices mix it perfectly.Modern Man - (8/10) - A slightly more uptempo song, that drives along at a steady pace. The lyrics are soft, and almost mocking of what we are today, but the driving guitar line makes this quite a listen.Rococo - (10/10) - Amazing. Simply amazing. Even the way it begins, with the wail of strings and the stumming of guitars is fascinating. It too is a bit mocking of modern life, but the song flows so perfectly, and the lyrics are dark and captivating.Empty Room - (8/10) - One of the few shorter songs on the album, which starts with a scream of strings, and the thudding of an electric guitar, and the segues perfectly into a soft female voice. The way it is sung makes you beieve every word/City With No Children - (8/10) - A strange little mix, with a soft drumline, a distorted guitar effect, and a uptempo tune. The chorus is definently the high point of the song, a swelling mix of voice and instrument. This song is a beautiful song of yearning.Half Light I - (6/10) - While it is pretty, it got quickly repetitive and dull, as the same guitar line repeats over and over and over. The lyrics are nice, and the singing is great though.Half Light II (No Celebration) - (10/10) - A creepy and dark song, with an amazing guitar line flowing throughout the song. The lyrics are a plea to run away, and save one from the sins they have committed. The background music ebbs and flows throughout the song like a perfect wave, and the blend of male and female lyrics make this song excel.Suburban War - (7/10) - A fast paced drum lead song, with an almost african feel to the drumline. The guitar swirls through an amazing riff over and over, and the soft vocals compliment the music.Month of May - (5/10) - I never really good get into the song. It sounds like a strange garage band song, and the lyrics aren't amazing, nor is the singing. Its catchy, sure, but I just didn't like it very much.Wasted Hours - (8/10) - A soft and slow balad, swimming comfortably in a soft musicscape, with subtle lyrics, and soft guitars.Deep Blue  - (5/10) - A slow song, with not much to it. I didn't enjoy it terribly much.We Used to Wait - (7/10) - A strange song that makes up for Deep Blue's slump. The lyrics are fascinating and the song is very catchy.Sprawl I (Flatlands) - (8/10) - A shorter song, but a joy to listen to. It's slower tempo, but a nice song all around.Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains) - (10/10) - Easily the highlight of the album. A beautiful mix, sung marvelously, and played beautifully. The lyrics are soft and sweet, and speak of the Mountains Beyond the Mountains, the neverending nature.The Suburbs (Continued) - (7.5/10) - It was slow and odd, but it offered a nice, soft ending to the album.All in all, a SOLID album, with very few bad songs in my opinion.Highlights: Rococo, City With No Children, Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\n", "val": 0.03698062524199486}

I also purchased from Amazon, a CD by \"The Russians, Crashing the Party.\" The sound quality on this CD was crystal clear and beautifully balanced. I want my CD's to sound live, not like AM Radio.

Because they're ARCADE FIRE...they who came out of nowhere with Funeral, debuting with an already fully-formed aesthetic, and the sheer confidence of a stadium-packing triumphant band.  And then Neon Bible with an even HUGER sound (an impossible thought on the heels of something like Wake Up from Funeral).And now this.  Watered down, tepid, and approaching dull in the shadow of those albums that came before it.In a way, I envy those who came to Arcade Fire with this album and found it eye-opening, for what they'll get to experience going back through the previous releases.  At the same time, I fear that this will define their sound for new listeners who simply won't bother with their earlier masterpieces.So to those who haven't heard Wake Up, Intervention, (Antichrist Television Blues), and what used to be the enormously impressive - awesome in the literal sense of the word - sound of what preceded this near-throwaway set, DO IT NOW.  You will think very differently about The Suburbs after.I should note, however, that there was another reviewer who suggested that the shoddy engineering and production may be the culprit with its unimpressive sound.

The writing is excellent and the music is fine.The problem is that it arrives with great hype and the album lacks an id, unless you are referring to tepid & insipid.  It has no heart or soul.  None of the songs build up or out or do much of anything.  It lacks any hint of range - veering only between elevator music and what they might play at the library if the library started playing music.Ultimately, great music has to have an edge.  Look at the legends - people like Lennon and Cobain - even in a whisper they screamed.  This album uses a inside voice from end to end, and slips from the mind immediately after you turn it off.  It's good, if you can consider music good thats neither powerful or moving or even the least bit exciting at any point.This is only a success as a concept album about the suburbs - in that it achieves the banal monotony and conformity to perfection.\n", "val": 0.00018909657956101}

The sound is reminiscent of Curve's best tracks, with a Swervedriver-esque energy, and yet feels completely fresh. It exposes and almost celebrates the transience of modern life.

{"text": "Upon first listen the Arcade Fire's fourth release The Suburbs is an album which in no way exceeds the expectations of its fans or for that matter any part of the independent music world, and yet that is the entire point. There is something lacking here that was present on previous releases, Funeral and especially the epically haunting Neon Bible. Extreme passion and angst. If Neon Bible at times feels like someone shouting in the down a cavernous and sometimes claustrophobic dimly lit church hallway than The Suburbs feels quite the opposite. In fact it has no feeling and it sounds to me that that is exactly the way the band wanted it.The attitude throughout the first half of the album and even parts of the second half is one where Win Butler, through clever lyrics and happy music, barely avoids complacency, sometimes even giving in to the nonsensical vain lifestyle that surrounds the characters he sings about. The title track is a perfect example of this. Its happy-go-lucky melody is almost too blissful to be true. The blissful melodies often employed in the songs suggests that suburbia is meant to be a place where a person can escape the world's problems and live in a sort of paradise yet, the lyrics of this song and the entire album speak of discontent in the suburban lifestyle.The fact that The Suburbs in many ways has lifted the urgency out of the Arcade Fire's music shows that suburbia is a place where greed and complacency take root and eventually lead to confusion and at times madness. To even try to describe suburbia through music means the passion and angst must be sucked out of the music in order to give an accurate sonic picture of suburbia and that is exactly what makes the album exciting and different. Don't get me wrong there are songs that actually have a lot of passion and urgency to them.  Those songs, in the context of the album tend to sound grander and more urgent than ever.  For example the song `We used to wait' is a song soaked in nostalgia and longing for a time where people had to write letters to correspond to each other and that act of writing letters was more deliberate and required more patience than any form of communication we have today. The lyrics perfectly describe this dilemma:  Win sings `So I never wrote a letter/I never took my true heart/ I never wrote it down' and `It seems strange/ How we used to wait for letters to arrive/But what's stranger still/ Is how something so small can keep you alive'. `Ready to Start' and `Month of May' are foot stomping numbers that make you almost want to get up and dance. There is a disguised madness here that, by the final track, overtakes both the music and the lyrics. The reprise of the title track is an eerie take on the original, echoing the sentiment that underneath all of the superficial layers, suburbia is a really pretty creepy and disillusioning place.It takes a lot to get into this album but once you do you'll be hooked especially if you grew up in a place that is considered suburbia. Like all Arcade Fire albums, this one is a grower and requires repeated listenings.I'd Give this 4.5  stars but we'll go with 5 because that is all Amazon allows us to do. Its definitely not as good as Neon Bible but I think its just as good as Funeral as an album. It definitely won't become a classic like Funeral did. In fact I am pretty sure this will become one the Arcade Fire's most underrated albums, much like Radiohead's Kid A was to Ok Computer.(though to be fair I am not comparing the content of AF albums to Radiohead. Of course Radiohead is more revolutionary as far as music goes)for more reviews like this one see [...]\n", "val": 0.002385825850069523}

{"text": "Every Arcade Fire release will always be compared to Funeral.  That's not fair, but that's what you get when you make one of the last decade's best records, and one of the few that truly captured the generation that grew up in the 90's and 00's.The Suburbs has a number of quality tracks but not the production, melody or vision of Funeral.  The singing is often muffled and they undersell their own abilities by leaving certain songs too sparsely arranged while others are overdone.  This record has the sound quality of bands of less talent like The Strokes.  Arcade Fire have a lot more talent than that.  They can ride with U2, Coldplay, The Police or any of the great alternative rock bands.  Their music transcends genres (Just ask John Legend).This record has far too many tracks to begin with.  Of the 16 tracks, the ones worth keeping are:  The Suburbs, Ready to Start, Modern Man, Empty Room, City with No Children, Half Light I, We Used to Wait.  If you're feeling charitable, then add \"Sprawl I\", \"Month of May\" and \"Suburban War\".Of these tracks, Empty Room and City with No Children are the best realized.  The most disappointing recording is Modern Man, which is one of the record's best tracks.  Great melody, but underenhanced, poorly sung, and it sounds like an indie band that reached beyond its abilities but didn't quite have the skill to pull it off.  I think it's a great song, but would like to see it re-recorded with some vocal harmony, keyboards/strings to complement the guitar, as well as better singing.  This song should stand right up there with Wake Up, Rebellion and Power Out, but takes several listens to get there.Another issue with this record is the writing style has changed.  On Funeral, they took simple melodies and built around them brilliantly.  It caused them to be inventive and find different ways to express the song.  That's what created the wild kinetic energy that defined that record. On this record, they are relying on more traditional chord structures, and the hooks we are used to don't always arrive. \"Suburban War\" is one example of this.  Nice guitar intro, but no great hook or chorus afterwards.  A lot of the tracks are quite sleepy.That said, I like this band a lot, and I like a number of these songs.  It is worth owning as compared to other music that is available today. However, I think they can do better.\n", "val": 0.00033406875445507467}

You see, I was one of those that felt this album was lacking because there wasn't a song that grabbed me like Wake Up or Keep the Car running from earlier Arcade Fire albums.  I'm not sure why as I tend to love cohesive albums more than what I call songs based albums, which brings me to my current love of the album.A couple of weeks ago, I happened to hear Month of May on the local NPR station, and I was loving it.  I decided, I'd give the album another listen, and I haven't stopped since.  This album is perhaps the most cohesive of all Arcade Fire albums and works well as a concept album.  While the previous Arcade Fire albums are fantastic, they tended to hold together well for my listening in smaller segments.  They weren't bad, but this album really carries the title theme through from start to finish very well.  It reminds me a bit of The Decemberists Hazards of Love album.I've seen criticism that this album is a bit too broad (too many tracks perhaps), but I like to think of it as part of the sprawl going with the title.  There are plenty of great tracks here that even the less interesting tracks feel like they work as transitions that are by no means bad.  This especially shows in songs like Half Light I and Sprawl I, which both serve as build ups to the two tracks I find the best on the album Half Light II and Sprawl II.This breadth with great tracks, transitions, etc, really make this album epic in proportions. At the same time, this is what makes the album a grower and led me to discover how great it was only after initially giving up myself.  I definitely think this is the Arcade Fire's best and definitely one of the better albums by any artist in 2010.\n", "val": 0.03629426285624504}

{"text": "When I listen to this album end to end, I find it pretty frustrating. There is a lot of great music, but not enough to make an enjoyable 60+ minute listen. I think part of my problem with it is that it is very wordy. While I like the general concept of the album, Win Butler is not Bob Dylan so when songs have lines and lines and lines of lyrics, I find myself losing interest.  Therefore my preference is to truncate the album into a leaner 45 minutes with a running order that focuses more on music and simpler lyrical themes:2. Ready to Start (why would you not start an album with a track called Ready to Start?)4. Rococo5. Empty Room (I do wish this song were a little longer, leaving more time for the string theme)6. City With No Children15. Sprawl II----10. Month of May3. Modern Man13. We Used to Wait8. Half Life II (to me a better climax than Sprawl II)7.

I still listen to the other tracks occasionally, but when I do, I don't find that I'm missing much.That said, when I look at other reviews, some of my least favorite tracks are their favorites!

{"text": "\"The Suburbs\" by Arcade Fire will rank near my list of top album releases for twenty ten for several reasons. First, it simply sounds great--the music is energetic, dense, and layered, and the vocals convey the right tone and emotion. It would have been easy for this recording to tilt toward bombast, but Winn Butler and Arcade Fire finesse sufficient restraint and taste throughout.Second, the album hangs together seamlessly and properly. I often listen to recordings and second guess song selection, order of songs, etc, but none of that here. I know there is an overarching concept about not being able to go back home or to another time, but it does not get in the way or demand too much attention.Third, Arcade Fire addresses modern angst and detachment without getting too lost in the weeds. Taken for what it is, \"The Suburbs\" could be a musical rendition of a Walker Percy novel, a slice of life captured effectively that does not require too much overthinking or analysis.I recommend a bit of volume and listening through a real stereo to bring out the best in this recording.\n", "val": 0.04491006210446358}

{"text": "It's Arcade Fire's best album so far if you're more into, say, their interesting hooks and sound layering than in the bombastic, self-indulgent aspect of their previous stuff.  These songs are all built closely around the theme of ... well, suburbs ... but they're also relatively self-contained.  Proper pop songs, at least for the most part.  Both the songwriting and performance style are cooler and more restrained this time around.  It's not that their style is \"mature\" now--that's usually not a nice thing to say about a rock band--but rather that this album features more of what Arcade Fire do really well, and less of the dramatic emoting.  Which makes the emoting pack more punch, where it does appear.\n", "val": 0.022852933034300804}
{"text": "Like Rush, R.E.M., The Cure and Radiohead before them, Arcade Fire seem bent on making unintelligible college-rock music that while often times musically engaging, is lyrically obtuse. One criteria that I use in determining whether an album is classic or merely just good. \"The Suburbs\" continues Arcade Fire's reach for artistic merits, but the album falls short--somewhere between good and very good, but not great or classic.When I see 16 tracks on an album I get nervous. Very few artists can pull off a lengthy 16 track opus, but Arcade Fire do a reasonably good job of it. The album is not boring overall, but there are a few tracks that could have been left on the cutting room floor, or as b-sides. The quality of the musical arrangements, melodies and compositions fit together well as a whole entity, but not individually. There are no really memorable tracks here, they all kind of compliment one another.The standout tracks to me were \"Modern Man\", \"City With No Children\", \"Half Light II\", \"Suburban War\", \"We Used To Wait\" and \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains\". The rest of the tracks were serviceable. I have been listening to pop/rock music for so many years now that I could not help but notice a few riffs borrowed from other pop/rock songs. For example, \"City With No Children\" has a guitar riff that comes dangerously close to The Rolling Stones' \"Street Fighting Man\" just change up slightly. \"Sprawl II\" has a synthesizer riff that's very similar to Julian Lennon's \"Stick Around\".But it's the lyrics that I really come back to. Arcade Fire has, from the very beginning, been an intangible entity. Like R.E.M., you have to revert to the lyric book just to figure out what they're singing about, but even then you are left with a rather oblique picture. It wasn't until later in their career, that R.E.M. started writing songs that were more accessible, and their popularity grew exponentially. For their first four albums, they were relatively obscure and mainly college rock. Fellow countrymen, Rush, had their first seven albums filled with fantasy/sci-fi themes that really didn't connect to a larger audience, and it wasn't until their eighth album that they really hit their stride combining lyrics and music as a whole. I feel that same issue plagues Arcade Fire. \"The Suburbs\" is not accessible. No matter how many times I reviewed the lyric sheet, I found my mind wandering off and listening to the melodies and arrangements instead.Musically, the band has changed slightly from album to album, but they are still recognizable as Arcade Fire. I guess what I am getting at here is that the band has room to grow. They are not a winner right out of the gate like some bands, nor are they one dimensional like some other bands. They sit poised to be as great as R.E.M. or Rush or even Radiohead, but they are not quite there yet. They seem to feeling their way still, but I believe they are capable of great things musically--it's there, when you listen to what they are doing, they just need a producer to harness and capture their essence.Here's how \"The Suburbs\" compares to Arcade Fire's other works:2004 Funeral: Four Stars2007 Neon Bible: Three and a Half Stars2010 The Suburbs: Three and a Half Stars\n", "val": 0.00018269791326019913}
{"text": "This is a fantastic album from a fantastic group. The Springsteen influences are very obvious, but they approach the sound in a fresh way. This is an album that demands you listen to it in its entirety-- if you don't, you just aren't getting the full picture. The Arcade Fire manage to segue the tracks into one another quite seamlessly, which makes it difficult to stop listening. Their sound on this LP is more polished than 2004's Funeral but less overproduced than 2007's Neon Bible (in other words, a good compromise). There is a bit of restraint here, mostly in Win Butler's voice, and occasionally in songs that hold back (like City With No Children). But there are standouts as well-- notably Ready to Start, a throbbing punk number, We Used to Wait, a subtly urgent piano-fueled rocker, and Month of May, a sizzling, searing visceral experience. If you like the Arcade Fire, it'll be hard not to like this. If you don't like or haven't heard of the Arcade Fire, this is a good place to start, as it's their most accessible album yet.Overall, this is an album that can't be missed. The themes are timeless but extraordinarily relevant. The sheer length of the album is surprising but completely satisfying.

{"text": "If you told me a new release was a concept album about suburbia, I'd approach it with a mixture of skepticism and curiosity.  If you told me it was a sixteen song c.d. with this theme, my preconceptions would have leaned to three possible conclusions:  overreaching, just plain hubris, or sheer genius.  After years of elaboration from Supertramp, the bottom line of The Monkees' \"Another Pleasant Valley Sunday,\" as well as Billy Joel's appropriate update, \"No Man's Land,\" what else needs to be said about the banality of life in the suburban world?Fortunately, because it comes from Arcade Fire, and music samples abound, their latest offering `The Suburbs' shouldn't be discounted.  I like to make up my mind on my own, but I have to admit, I'd go no further if it wasn't for favorable reviews by `Rolling Stone' and `The Boise Independent'.  For the former, Arcade Fire's creative prospects are still flourishing; for the latter accolades come just short of this generation's `Sgt. Pepper' or `Nevermind'.  Either way it's an easy bet this offering is on the short list for The Top Ten albums of the year.Arcade Fire prevent themselves from painting into a corner by elaborating this theme well--and, going out on a limb--they're more consistent at sticking to their concept than The Beatles ever were.  The real goldmine, however, comes from the music itself, which is more varied than The Mall of America.  With shivery and shimmering strings, solid piano,  and cascades of synthesizers on select songs, their collection remains solid and interesting.  The texture and sound is outstanding throughout.  To build my own analogy, `The Suburbs' is this summer's `Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'.The sing-a-long with the piano feel is given to the title track and \"Deep Blue;\" but they're also rock `n' roll ready with punky moments like \"Month of May\" and \"Empty Room\".  There's plenty--perhaps too many--pensive moments, too, but \"Wasted Hours\" with its 'Pet Sounds' nuances does more than tread water, and the Rickenbacher 12-string Byrdesque folk sound accompanying \"Suburban War\" is supple and smooth.  Synthesizers are awash in \"City with No Children,\" so at least `The Suburbs' music never gets boring.As the talking head, Win Butler, seldom runs out of elaborations.  \"Something don't feel right.../Like a record skipping, I'm a modern man. Maybe when you're older you'll understand./Why you don't feel right. Why you don't sleep at night.\"  While his sentiments on \"Modern Man\" may resemble W.H. Auden's  (The poet who coined the phrase, \"Age of Anxiety\".), the soundtrack is indelibly and unforgettably Arcade Fire's.  . Although \"Wasted Hours\" can't be considered the suburban counterpart to Springsteen's \"Jungleland,\" and \"Suburban Sprawl\" (the first) sports a dangerous trend toward snooze control, \"Suburban Sprawl II\" gets right to the point.  While Butler's vocals resemble the next Neil Young, his wife,  R&eacute;gine Chassagne's siren Yoko Ono-esque vocals admirably lament \"...We can never get away from this sprawl, living in the sprawl/ Dead shopping malls/ Rise like mountains beyond mountains.\"The lectures, sermons, and stories made in between are left for you to investigate (They're about as eloquent as they are unsurprising--although one of the C.D.'s very best songs, \"City with No Children,\" is hardly retread.)  While not all territory is groundbreaking on 'The Suburbs,' the musical variety is enough to fill our shopping bag with enough nuances to keep us satisfied for some time to come.(Please note that if you are downloading 'The Suburbs' you should put the seconds for no pause if you are burning a c.d. because of the number of segues--indiscernible pauses characteristic of classical music and brought to popular music on The Beatles' 'Sgt. Pepper'--are considerable.)\n", "val": 0.018725566565990448}

Creativity runs rampant on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Suburbs/dp/B003O85W3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Suburbs</a>, surprisingly trumping the grand&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Neon-Bible/dp/B000MGUZM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Neon Bible</a>&nbsp;at times.  While \"Intervention\" isn't necessarily bested, there are songs of nearly/if not the same level on 'The Suburbs'.The album opens up superbly with the strong \"The Suburbs,\" where frontman Win Butler's vocals are their most clear and present - not to mention his grand falsetto on the refrain  (\"sometimes I can't believe it/I'm moving past the feeling again\").  \"The Suburbs\" benefits from a fine and haunting production work filled with strings, electric and acoustic guitars, and piano.  \"Ready to Start,\" a personal favorite cut, maintains a driving groove and contrasts the mid-tempo groove of \"The Suburbs.\" Again, the superb songwriting lends a catchy refrain (\"If I was scared, I would, and If I was bored (broke, pure, etc.), you know I would, If I was yours, I'm not... now I'm ready to start.\" 'The Suburbs' bats a thousand with \"The Suburbs\" and \"Ready to Start.\"\"Modern Man\" finds the band dabbling in asymmetrical meter and once again a minimal harmonic progression provides the backdrop for Butler's vocals.  Not quite as epic as \"The Suburbs\" or \"Ready to Start,\" its still a fine cut.  \"Rococo\" loses no momentum, while \"Empty Room\" is an interesting listen, if a bit hard to decipher.  Regin Chassagne, wife of Butler leads the charge vocally but the busy production work overtakes her vocals.  This cut would've benefited from being mixed slightly better, but maybe the cacophonous effect was what the band had in mind.\"City With No Children\" proves to be much better featuring a notable bass line and a clever groove.  On \"City With No Children,\" the religious allusions come full circle as Butler sings \"feel like I've been living in, a city with no children in it, a garden left to ruin...\" \"Half Light I\" and \"Half Light II (No Celebration)\" are two contrasting cuts, both worthy of a couple of spins.  On \"Half Light I\" Regin Chassagne is the main focus, where her lovely vocals are better produced this go-round.  On \"Half Light II (No Celebration), \" Butler takes the reigns, with Chassagne's vocals harmonizing mid-way through the first verse, mixed in the background.\"Suburban War\" stands out, if mainly because of its stylistic changes at given points within the track.  \"Month of May\" finds Arcade Fire channelling \"punk rock\" to an extent  with its driving guitar work and Butler's raw vocals.  \"Wasted Hours\" doesn't necessarily stand out, but it is another solid number.  \"Deep Blue\" and \"We Use To Wait\" are both Arcade Fire cuts at their best.  On \"Deep Blue,\" the guitars take on a \"garage\" sound and the piano twinkles make this cut reminiscent of a saloon or lounge.  \"We Use To Wait\" makes clever use of a minimalistic piano figure and clever songwriting.\"Sprawl I (Flatland)\" turns out to be a languid, dark cut exploiting a vulnerable sounding Win Butler while its sister cut \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\" sounds as if it could have been equally at home on MGMT's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Congratulations/dp/B0037W68F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Congratulations</a>. \"Sprawl II\" is a worthwhile cut if for no other reason than it contrasts everything else that Arcade Fire has released at this point.  Kudos for that.  A reprise of \"The Suburbs (Continued)\" closes the album.'The Suburbs' is easily one of the top albums of 2010.  Here, Arcade Fire deliver an album that is both captivating and different from their previous effort.

To tell you the truth I can't stop listening to this album!The sounds and the chords can appear ordinary and even boring upon first listen. Many of the songs tonally sound similar but taken as a whole the mood is unflinching and overwhelming in its power to communicate displacement and longing. This is an album. It should be listened to that way and taken as is for that. If you want a quick brainless 3 minute song then this is not the place to look. If you want something that will make you raise your fist to the sky, scream in release and make you long for something forgotten then get the suburbs!\n", "val": 0.0005763086955994368}
{"text": "How many downstroked eighth and sixteenth notes on acoustic guitar can one album have? Come and see!I do love the sincerity and depth that AF strives toward, and they have some glorious moments here, lyrically most of all, but let's be honest: a lot of these tunes sound like a lot of these other tunes---almost suburbanly cookie-cutterish--- and there are precious few memorable melodies. It's all about mood, but it's mainly that one Arcade Fire mood...perhaps a distillation of their own memories of suburban angst? With each downstroke we bury thee, thoughts of impending gloom! When Month Of May shows up it seems like a punky breath of fresh air...until one realizes it's just another fest of downstroked 16th-notes, only this time on electric gits.If I was still in my teens this might be manna from heaven, in all its ineluctable inscrutability. Honestly, I miss that period when music grabbed me by the you-know-whats and meant everything. If you're right there with this right now, god bless you: enjoy it to the hilt while you have it. At some point you'll have heard so many records that it will all blend together and that special wallop of newness will be a rare and special memory. Savor it now.I can see how this might have that for some, but for me it's all a little bit too homogeneous. Yet it's still got that sheen of unique it-ness that distinguished OK Computer and other modern classics. It doesn't quite grab me that strongly, but maybe I haven't given it enough spins yet.The lyrics do have some sweet points (AF aren't afraid to use their brains, their greatest asset), and this could easily become an anthem for many suburban kids, emo-version 2.0, semi-beta.It doesn't sound like anything else except the last AF album, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n", "val": 0.018165983259677887}
{"text": "Allegedly a song cycle that came together after various band members either visited or heard from the areas they grew up, \"The Suburbs\" is Arcade Fire's love-hate letter to nostalgia, decay and growth, growing up and the hazy nostalgia of being young in a small town. It's a pretty good series of songs, and more straight-forward than \"Neon Bible.\"There's also a decidedly folkier edge to the music this time around, especially in the title track and the epic \"Sprawl II.\" However, there are still times when the dense rock that built the band's reputation. The punkish \"Ready To Start\" may be the most propulsive song AF has ever recorded, and the ever present Springsteen influence reigns over \"City With No Children.\" The blend of songs is pretty incredible, as fairly soon afterward is the poppish lament of \"Wasted Hours,\" reminiscent of The Band, and the most acerbic lyric of the whole album.\"The Suburbs\" is a complex and rich album, yet Arcade Fire's most direct. When Wim sadly describes \"kids and buses still waiting to be free,\" it cuts as hard as anything off \"Funeral\" ever did for me. I may find \"Funeral\" to remain their best album, but \"The Suburbs\" is maybe even more universal. One of the year's best.\n", "val": 0.040095049887895584}

{"text": "For this extensive track-by-track review of Arcade Fire's \"The Suburbs,\" I will be writing a short analysis of each track while listening to the album as a whole (not for the first time, of course). Each track will be rated out of ten (10) points. At The end, I will write on my overall feeling towards the record and score the album out of ten (10) points (an average of the individual scores, with an addition +/- .5 point as a bonus, if chosen to do so), rounding to the closest star for Amazon. Enjoy!1) The Suburbs- A great title track, despite what some reviewers have said. At first, it feels unaturally simple for Arcade Fire, but after repeated listens, there is definately some great substense underneath the subtlety of the instrumentation. \"I want a daughter while I'm still young/ but if it's too much to ask, send me a son,\" Win sings with an undeniable sense of passion. Nice. (9/10)2) Ready To Start- Very catchy, and an instant stand out upon intial listens. \"all the kids have always known/ the emperor wears no clothes/ but they bow down to him anyway\" still rings through my mind. At times, however, the song becomes a bit too serious for its own good, then of course, this is Arcade Fire ;) (9/10)3) Modern Man- Another instant standout, \"Modern Man\" begins a string of songs that, for better or worse, sound like throwbacks to '80s mainstream rock. \"Jessie's Girl\" comes to mind on this one, for some reason. Anyway, I dig this song a lot, very catchy again, and deserves a nice (9/10)4) Rococo- This song sounds like Win was pissed at touring and therefore decided to write an epic that teases his obssesive fanbase. Lyric-wise, I find this song lame, but the grandious 2nd half is a nice pay-off, especially the sa-weet guitar solo. (7/10)5) Empty Room- the defintion of that epic Arcade Fire sound. For me, there's something liberating about the simple-but- true lyrics \"when I'm by myself, I can be myself.\" Once this song starts, it doesn't let go. Another wonderful solo. Perhaps my favorite song on the album. (10/10)6) City With No Children- This is a nice style for Arcade Fire, almost like a Neil Young parody. Lyrically superb. Musically, it just feels like it fits perfectly with the album's suburb theme. It's grown on me. Yet another (9/10)7)Half Light I- ...and this is where the album takes a turn for the (slightly) worse. With an album over an hour long, it was bound to happen, but this middle section tends to bore me. This song barely registers with my memory after repeated listens. Its not bad, by any means, just forgetable in the midst of some true gems. I do like the violin work, though. (5/10)8)Half Light II (No Celebration)- \"No Celebration\" Indeed. This song almost as forgetable as its brother. Again, not bad, but also not necessary. 6/10)9) Suburban War- The uncertain feel of the guitar work fits the song nicely. The town was built to change, Win suggests. The change-up at the end adds a nice touch. \"all my old friends, they don't know me now!\" (8/10)10) Month of May- some may call this the \"low point\" of the album. A few weeks ago, I may have agreed. But, now, I truly enjoy this song. It's catchy as hell (\"the kids are standing with their arms folded tight!\") and the riff is simple, but infectious. \"First they built the road, then they built the town.\" (9/10)11) Wasted Hours- I think this song could've been another nice choice for 1st track. Feels very reminiscent, somewhat Beatles-esque. \"Wasted hours, before we knew, where to go and what to do.\" (8/10)12) Deep Blue- I like this song, but it drags after a while. Again, reminds be of the Beatles, late sixties. ALmost as if the song wants to end, only Win is making it suffer. (7/10)13) We Used To Wait- Another favorite track. The stacato (spell fail) works perfect. I can't find the right words, so just listen. (10/10)14) Sprawl I (Flatland)- The subtle guitar work fits the song well, but unfortunately, the song suffers due to an unusually bland lyrical spectrum and is slightly annoying in its serious addittude. It is thankfully and mercifully short. (4/10)15) Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)- This song has been very strongly hyped, and while I can understand why, I do not completely agree. It is very refreshing after the preceding, somewhat dull, tracks. Lyrically, it can be a little too obvious, unimaginitive. However, the general feel is uplifting and deserves a solid (8.5/10)16) The Suburbs (Continued)- Somehow, this quiet little ending is more heartfelt than anything else on this record. \"If I could have it back, all the time that we wasted, I'd only waste it again.\" A great ending to a solid record. (9/10)FINAL THOUGHTS- Despite my somewhat flawless scoring of the record, The middle of the album tears down what could've been a rival to even \"Funeral.\" In the end, we have a great album that could've been a masterpeice, if only the fat was trimmed off before release.FINAL SCORE: (7.96/10) ROUNDS TO FOUR STARS OUT OF FIVE- \"GREAT\"\n", "val": 0.009563210420310497}

{"text": "It's going to stink waiting for new Arcade Fire material now. I burned through their three albums in less than a year, and now it's going to be a while until the next one. Oh well, guess I'll have to find another indie band to obsess over for a while.If I had to rank them, I'd put The Suburbs behind Funeral and ahead of Neon Bible, although the important thing is that they haven't messed up yet, and their sound continues to grow and evolve as they figure out what kind of band they are. Bible had much more obvious musical influences than Funeral, while in The Suburbs you can still feel the effect of previous work on the songs, it's much less blatant and gives it a more timeless quality. It's sort of a compromise between their first two albums in a way, a bit more mature than Funeral but more down to earth and apolitical than Neon Bible. I'm very excited to see where they continue to go from here.\"The Suburbs\" and \"Ready to Start\" are a perfect one-two punch to begin the proceedings, full of energy and the band's unique flair. \"Modern Man\" is a more mellow track, but it keeps it interesting enough. \"Rococo\" didn't amaze me at first beyond a couple elements, but it's actually turned out to be perhaps the most insidious earworm on the album. \"Empty Room\" is the first song on the album sung primarily by Regine, and a catchy one. I like Win just fine obviously, but I think they both have a lot to bring to the table, and it was a bit disappointing when she only really sang half of one song on Neon Bible. She shows up more here, and it's fun.\"Half Light\", the first of two two-parters, is a pretty nice pair of songs, and they're followed by \"Suburban War\", a pleasant track in its own right that transforms itself with a minute and a half to go in a pretty awesome way. If the album has a weakness, it's the four tracks after that before the intoxicating \"Sprawl\" I and II. They're nice songs, doing their own unique thing on the album, it's just that they kind of make the whole thing seem a bit overstuffed, and if there were just two of them there instead of all four I think it would flow better.  But anyway, \"Sprawl\" is awesome and the final track brings everything full circle. It's a great album that might have been better with a bit of trimming, but I can't really complain about having more Arcade Fire songs, can I?\n", "val": 0.02005545049905777}

I've played it so often because I have been trying to determine why, after the initial listen, I declared this work, \"brilliant.\"I never judge music after one listen. Like wine, the third sip tells you if the drink is good. The first two help you tongue acclimate to the flavors. By the third listen, I can make a fairer assessment. The Suburbs is different. Each listen endorses my initial reaction. Somewhere around listen ten, I thought maybe the disc had a soft middle. I spend the next few plays trying to affirm that reaction, but I couldn't. There are no weak links. This is a strong, strong compilation of a mature musical team at their prime.In the New York Times last week, an editorial indicated that many fans are calling the band, \"sell-outs\" because of this CD. Apparently, there is a ceiling of sales to qualify a group of musicians as \"hip.\" What these folks fail to realize is that the masses are constantly growing. Creative people are always out front, blazing new trails. When the masses meet the creative, this is a good thing. The level of appreciation has been raised. The listener is better for the experience and the artists can begin again with a new path, in a new direction.Regardless whether you feel this is the first step on Arcade Fire's road to perdition or the logical next chapter after Neon Bible, this is damn fine music from a group simply at the top of their game. Don't hate them because they are good, revel in the fact that we have great musicians making remarkable music. This does not happen that often.\n", "val": 0.014625957235693932}

I admit, a month ago when two tracks leaked in lo-fi, it was a bit disappointing.  This is an album that may deliver some favorites (like Neon Bible did), but it is an album that should be listened to in its entirety in the sequence Arcade Fire has designated for you. Learn to not be scared of the evolution the band has taken, it's not an opposite direction but a stride forward in creating a rock opera without having a cheesy storyline and without having to call it a 'rock opera'. \"The Suburbs\" is another uplifting arrangement brought to you by some of my favorite Canadians.

{"text": "My hope is that the group re-masters this album. I have tried to listen to it from first cut to last, as the album demands, but can only get through a few songs at a time. It's hard work. You have to focus on one instrument or voice at a time to pull it out of the muddy mixes, in order to hear, much less enjoy (if that's possible), what any musician is doing. I suspect that too many locations (studios, homes, basements, whatever) were used to record all the tracks, and the only way to get a \"consistent\" sound on the recording was to mix it 50/50 with white noise. Go see them live, it's the only way to hear what they intended.The only way to listen this recording, on further reflection, is really LOUD. If you have tolerant neighbors and NO plans for hearing in your immediate future, play it at concert levels. It sounds just \"right\" then.Earphones and earbuds, BTW won't cut it. What we have here is a live concert album.  Just add bad parking, 10,000 people and some jerk that stands up in front of you for the whole concert.The Un-staged concert sounds slightly better in sound quality, but the song sequencing on the CD is epic.Arcade Fire has given me what I've always wanted: - the live concert version of new music, when the \"studio version\" comes out.

{"text": "Not since Neil Peart of Rush explored the depths of suburban alienation in \"Subdivisions\" has a band tackled the topic with such insight.Arcade Fire takes listeners on a ride through the suburbs, and each track takes up the theme in some way.For me, \"Suburban War\" stands out.  Lyrically, it tells the story of two friends growing up in the suburbs who ultimately go their own ways.  First, they grow their hair long together.  Later, \"you cut your hair; I never saw you again.\" Musically, it begins with Byrds'-like guitar plucking and ends with impassioned drumming as the story moves to a close -- \"my old friends, they don't know me now.\"  It may not get the radio play of other tracks on the release, but it's clearly the best song.Overall, it's an excellent release for Arcade Fire.  The band's style defies categorization at times.  One song sounds like Kate Bush; others sound like an indie band on its way to growing up.I like most of the tracks but could do without \"Rococo,\" which seems like a throwaway song.

{"text": "Confronting the ever-impending threat of death, Arcade Fire  has never lacked angst or even outright anger in its music.  \"Funeral\" is a very literal reaction by the band after experiencing the deaths of relatives while recording.  \"Neon Bible\" apocalyptically outlined an emergent generation's fears of demise of their nation or greater society. With their latest release The Suburbs, the trend continues with an equally yet more localized destruction, this time focusing on crumbling pockets of isolated community.  But rather than another version of accepting death, The Suburbs is more a declaration of war on dual fronts.On the one hand, it is a not very subtle declaration against certain waning generational forces, namely the baby-boomer generation (as my wife will strenuously assert, I must add).  Songs like \"City With No Children\" describe the anger against millionaires rotting in their decaying private prisons, \"Sprawl\" visualizing endless mountains of illuminated shopping malls, where we are urged to \"quit our pretentious things and just punch the clock\", the insignificance of buildings built in the 70s that crumble without anyone caring, or worse, even noticing.A double edged sword, the album is also a declaration of war on our internal forces.  Generation X has now grown up, and has to face not only the excess of the boomers but perhaps the lack of our willingness to overcome the boredom of the suburbs and mature beyond ourselves. Indeed, in the title track, Win Butler sings of a desperation to avoid something worse than death, not only growing old but having a family as a \"grown up\".  Furthermore, the songs touch upon a future unable to be prepared for: losing friends to adulthood, remembering the glory and perfection of our wasted time in youth, realizing it may have been better to remain a kid on a bus longing to be free than to be an adult and dealing with the all-encompassing sprawl. It has a definite `80s nostalgia but with a 21st century gut-wrenching epiphany of excess.Musically, this is the tightest release yet by Arcade Fire. The vocals from Win Butler seem a little more constrained than Neon Bible, perhaps to rest his voice, but also to follow the psychological tension of the album.  Regine Chassagne has expanded her backup singing and really perfects the vulnerability in Sprawl II.  Admittedly, this is less Americana than previous albums, as the effervescent violin and volatile percussion is distinctly muted, nevertheless achieving its suburban atmosphere. There are too many excellent songs to list, but my favorites include \"Wasted Hours\", \"We Used to Wait\", \"Modern Man\" and the title track.  The Suburbs is a really powerful album, a quietly desperate Brian De Palma suburban gunfight erupting within indiscriminate cul-de-sacs across the country, perhaps right now in your neighborhood.\n", "val": 0.0010086814872920513}

{"text": "Two days ago I got this CD and I must say that I felt in love with it right away. Aracde fire's new album was one of the few this year that I've been waiting for. Of course, this is no way near \"Neon bible\" (2007) and its gothic-indie dark sound which was the reason why I felt in love with this band. I mean, \"The Suburbs\" doesn't posses those magnificent moments nor the big arrangements found in its predecessor but the intention from the band that I got as soon as I listened to the whole album was not to do that again. Instead, Arcade fire put all its money in this \"weird\" mainstream sound a la \"Echo and the bunnymen\" and by moments maybe flirting with \"Joy division\" style.\"The suburbs\" (the first single and track of the record) is a weird, catchy tune played by a band setting up a pop record on their own terms. \"Ready to start\" is the first move the band made here to sound \"easier and more loose\" for the listeners' benefit if they had any problems with their previous records. \"Modern man\" is a great song... very catchy and fun to listen to (for some reason R.E.M. comes to my mind with this song). \"Rococo\" on the other hand isn't exactly one of my favorites but still has this weird vibe that Arcade fire got me used to after \"NB\". \"Empty room\" seemed to be co-written with a Radiohead member back in 1995 (in the whole \"The Bends\" era). Weird, catchy arrangements pointing to total hysteria when actually is just turns out to be another pop number (loved the string sample at the very beginning). \"City with no children\" is the first song that might feel the hardcore fan of the band pretty uncomfortable considering that this track sounds like anything U2 could do in their big shows. \"Half light I\" is pretty cool (darky and somehow freindly to listen to... very 70's vibe on this one with the organ and the strings) and then \"Half light II (no celebration)\" comes back to picks up where \"city with...\" left... another pop song a la U2. I must say that \"Suburban war\" is one of the strongest songs in the record if you ask me. More indie rock is going on here and less synths around the track. From this point on and for the next following four songs the record seems to be stuck in a hole. The songs \"Month of may\", \"Wasted hours\", \"Deep blue\" and \"We used to wait\" don't really offer anything interesting to listen to... a little punk going on here and there, some piano samples and some acoustic guitars now and then make this part of the record a little boring. I'm not saying that the songs are bad 'cause actually they're not. It's just that these tracks don't seem to be in the same level as the first ones were. To me they're just a bridge you have to cross before arriving to another great part of these \"Suburbs\". Once you're on the other side \"Sprawl I\" will be waiting for you with another dark vibe like \"Half light I\" did. And then, \"Sprawl II (mountains beyond mountains)\" comes. The poppiest song on the record. A very 80's sound with bunch of synth samplers going on and a beat that you might want to dance with as well. I liked this song a lot but is not exactly what I could expect from a band like Arcade fire. Finally, \"The suburbs (continued)\" is just a pointless reprise track from the first one if you ask me to finish the record.To sum up, this record is great but as a huge fan that I was with \"Neon bible\" I was expecting the band to dare more and to try something \"more challenging\" for them in order to put their music skills to work. To be more explicit, when Radiohead released \"Ok computer\" (1997) I expected the same from them after that record and what I received three years later was one of the weirdest record I have ever listened to \"KID A\" (2000) and from that moment on they went up hill ever since.

Some time later, i've saw on TV a live performance of Wake Up by them alone and i thought \"Wow, this is amazing!\", but haven't paid attention further than that anyway.And then, came a day, that i was on youtube looking for clips of Potemkin, and then i found the Intervention video.Since that day i've become a huge fan of Arcade Fire.Both Funeral and Neon Bible struck me really hard, no other modern albums struck me as they did.So i was eager to hear this new album.Is it great? Yes. Is it better than their previous albums? No.No, i have to admit, it isn't superior to NB and Funeral, in fact, probably isn't at the same level. But Arcade Fire reached in those albums very high standards of creativity, higher than most of the modern bands albums. So, if you create something that great, clearly, it's higly possible that your next effort will be below them.This happened here, but don't get it wrong, it's a great album anyway, far better than most of the albums released this year (i will not dare to say the better), so i't a really pleasing hearing.Not only is good because it has good song and it's well played, but because Arcade Fire has shown again that they are versatile, it's not an effort to do the something in the vein of their previous albums, it's an effort to do something different and new, and by far, something good. That's what i expect of them, and they filled that expectation.Third Albums are usually a problem for most of the bands, Arcade Fire hadn't that problem, they will pass this test with easyness.Buy it. You won't regret it.\n", "val": 0.023538870736956596}

This is music friendly album, which means its an album that will do no harm nor will it over thrill. An album is suppose to deliver something fresh, something new to the table, original, and this album does none of the above. It sounds very similar of other artist that sounded original and fresh when this was introduced. This is just another add-on album of what was covered already. No edge, nothing distinct, and believe it or not an Arcade Fire fan posted that the slower songs have more definition in their sound and that I agree.If you truly want to test a good album is play it through a couple times, see if its cohesive, see if you are skipping to the next track, and see if its one of the first albums in your collection you would play at a later date or if your returning to the artist previous album.

Though I will keep my original review, for honesty's sake, my opinion of this album has obviously grown tremendously.)\"Suburbs\" is not the same Arcade Fire we have heard in the previous two albums. But just because it's different does not mean it's bad. I guess most critics would consider this a \"more mature\" album than Funeral and Neon Bible. The lyrics are thoughtful and thought provoking and the melodies are moving. No, it does not seem to have the passion and energy of AF's first albums, but each album is a progression into who the band is becoming. I was disappointed after the first couple listens, but around the third and fourth runs through I have accepted that this album does not have a \"Wake Up\" or a \"Keep the Car Running\" I love to blast through my car windows. But it does have the airy and surprisingly bright (considering the lyrics) \"City With No Children\" and the eerie and sorrowful \"Half Light II.\" I don't think many people want the youthful energy and engaging sound they fall in love with to change as bands evolve musically, but that is just the nature of music (unless, of course, you listen to Andrew W. K.). So if you find yourself bored the first couple times through, give it a chance to grow on you. Hopefully you will find it just as satisfying even if it's not as rockin'.\n", "val": 0.05372832342982292}
{"text": "Third albums are problematic. They are often viewed -- rightly or wrongly -- as the make-or-break point for musical artists. Take Bruce Springsteen, for example. His first two albums displayed a distinctive viewpoint and style (or styles: is there anybody that guy didn't steal from?) and lots of promise, but it wasn't enough. His label was ready to drop him. He was discouraged. It had been two years since his second album failed to chart. Then in 1975 \"Born to Run\"  finally propelled him into the zeitgeist. His real masterpiece, \"Darkness at the Edge of Town,\" didn't appear till three years later, but it didn't matter: he was already in the public consciousness.Now we come to Arcade Fire, easily the most exciting act to come down the pike in the last ten years. Anticipation, needless to say, was high after the artistic achievement previously displayed. So what have we got? I defy anybody to listen to \"No Cars Go\" or \"Keep the Car Running\" and say any of the tracks on \"The Suburbs,\" except, perhaps, \"Ready to Start,\" compare to them in any way -- save where they might be similar in structure or melody to those earlier, superior efforts. Disappointing, to the point where a decent 3-star album might get docked a star for being so. However, I will confess that after (1) a few more listenings, and (2) attending one of their recent -- electrifying -- LA shows, which was liberally peppered with this new material, I anticipate their fourth with as much excitement as I had for this one.\n", "val": 0.0007179548847489059}

Here's my 2 cents worth: 3rd album from these Montreal, Canada stalwarts of the indie rock scene is composed of big,  modern, inquisitive pop/rock songs with a near-epic quality, driven by multi-tracked instruments  spread over poignant & catchy melodies with perceptive lyrics that explore the fallacy of the  suburban dream experience.  Organically prodigious, anthemic tunes laid on a conceptual string  that vibrates with the tenacity of driving expansionism.  These songs range from easy flowing pop  structures to aggressive, complex & sophisticated rock--all sealed with a kiss of sincerity.  It feels  like it could be a grower.

{"text": "Controlled chaos.That might be the best way to describe the Arcade Fire and their new release, the Suburbs.Most, if not all, the Montreal based septet are multi-instrumentalists and take some part in the writing of each song, though Win Butler does most of the writing/heavy lifting. But Arcade Fire is creative in ways of arrangements and mixing instruments like no other band.The Suburbs is longer than their first two disks - over an hour of music. It is seemingly more of a combination of their debut Funeral and its follow-up Neon Bible than it is a departure. The jury is still out (with me) as if it is better than Neon Bible, let alone what I would consider the best disk of 2010.Though not billed as a \"concept album\", one might take it that way if so chosen.I can't help thinking that some of the disk is out of sequence if this were a concept disk. The excellent \"Wasted Hours\" would be right at the front of the playlist (\"first they built the roads; then they built the town\"). Then the disk could have kicked into \"Ready to Start\" - and it does kick.With \"Ready to Start\", sometimes it seems this is the song with most energy, passion and sincerity. (\"if I was yours, but I'm not\" or \"I would rather be alone; than pretend I feel alright\", but then conversely Butler sings: \"but to bow down to them anyway; is better than to be alone\".) Yes, life is the suburbs is no picnic.That song really is the killer track on this disk. I have played it dozens of times and am really into it. But I think AF does a great job on \"Rocco\", \"Modern Man\", \"City with No Children\", \"Suburban War\" and \"We Used to Wait\". The latter song takes a while to kind of get going. Hell, the first half of it is two piano keys, but I'm really digging it.I also like both \"Sprawl I (Flatlands)\" and \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\". Ditto with \"Half Light\" I and II.I'll be honest, I was not much of a fan of Rgine Chassagne. But for her work on this disk, I'm at least enjoying: \"Sprawl II\" works, as does \"Empty Room\" \"Half Light\" Maybe on the latter tracks (I and II), she does more singing with Butler. Her songs here are somewhat reminiscent of \"In the Backseat\" from Funeral. I didn't like anything she did on Neon Bible.I want to like the title tracks more. I like the lyrics and the melody enough, but the Joplin-esque piano drives me to distraction. The reprise is somewhat throwaway, yet necessary almost to end the disk.\"Month of May\" starts out incredibly strong, until vocals are put into the mix. I was so excited when it started, but it is hard to sit through for me. But for all their mania, there are a number of slower songs, which while they existed on other disks, they did not seem as sparse.Yes, there is a lot going on with the Suburbs, but the same can be said for all their disks. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. I saw their live-stream Madison Square Garden set and much of this works better live than on album.My current conclusion (always subject to change with further listenings), is that it's a very good disk, but right now, not great. Neon Bible struck me more from the first listen and three years later has held me there. We'll see if the Suburbs does the same thing.\n", "val": 0.011259010061621666}

{"text": "Arcade Fire's latest is less sing-along anthems and more straight-ahead, often retro, rock and roll.  Some of these songs sound like they could have been radio hits back in the days when you could still hear rock music on the radio.  \"Modern Man\" could almost be Matthew Sweet, the bluesy \"Wasted Hours\" could be a Replacements outtake, and in the fabulous \"Sprawl II\", Regine is channeling Heart of Glass-era Blondie.And yet somehow, the album does not come off as derivative.  While it may be more intimate and less orchestral than Funeral or Neon Bible, the epic, heart-on-sleeve emotion that is Arcade Fire's hallmark is still there.  All the conflicting emotions of growing up in the suburbs are given their due - from ambivalence to nostalgia, from the longing for escape to the comforts of the familiar.Upon repeated listens I find some of the mellower songs to be the ones that grow on me the most.  \"Half Light I\" has some of the most beautiful instrumentation I've heard on any Arcade Fire song, and \"Deep Blue\"'s use of spare piano and almost whispered vocals packs an emotional punch.  \"Modern Man\" is simply one of the best radio-friendly pop songs I've heard in ages.I'd say if you loved Funeral and Neon Bible, you will love The Suburbs as well.  However, even if you were one of the few who didn't like the 2 earlier albums, The Suburbs might just change your mind.  Arcade Fire has managed to pull off the difficult feat of progressing while still remaining true to themselves.

{"text": "Let's make no bones about it - like nearly everyone else, I thought Arcade Fire's Funeral  was a debut of startling punch and clarity. I still do. It's an album of dizzying highs thrust between sombre reflections that weren't just there to space out the loud songs, but that took the album's theme and meaning and crafted new textures around it. Hell, I still can't help feeling a bit teary when I remember the Where the Wild Things Are  promo featuring Max and the monsters thundering through the forest to 'Wake Up', one of those near-perfect melds of song and vision that come along every few years or so. And it was only an advertisement for a movie, for God's sake.You might be tempted to say that not much has changed between drinks for Win and the crew. They still seek the Epic, they're still chasing down the Big Themes. Only now, the albums are six songs longer. This ain't so bad if there's a bit of variation for the listener to stretch out into (see Broken Social Scene's Forgiveness Rock), but if you're going to relentlessly pursue a single mood for more than hour, then you better be serving up some A game. And musically, The Suburbs is almost there. There are a couple of missteps ('Month of May', 'Sprawl I (Flatlands)') and although Butler's voice seems to have much less emotional range, there are a raft of cracking tunes.But the lyrics. Here's a sample of what you'll hear throughout: The kids. The kids. The kids. The kids. The kids. It's like being stuck in a ghost train made of Robbie Williams and Kylie. \"So what?\" you say. \"Funeral mentioned children an awful lot. Arcade Fire are writing what they've always written.\" That's true. Funeral's references worked because Arcade Fire were younger, more desperate, more uncertain. They were kids themselves. Now, rather than feeling like Funeral's work of precocious genius, The Suburbs feels like a band that's achieved indie tenure, and worse, that's settled into the role. The constant, knowing drum-banging comes across as trite - even when the lyrics are uncertain, they're certain about that uncertainty.The Suburbs is still a good album. There are depths here to be explored, and most fans will be happy with it (and probably unhappy with this). But it's not what Arcade Fire are truly capable of. It's telling that one of the best songs is the eponymous outro, all stripped down and regretful instead of rah-rah fist-pumping. It's also three minutes shorter than anything else on here.3.5 /5 starsStandout tracks:  Empty Room, Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains), The Suburbs (Continued)\n", "val": 0.002806322881951928}

A problem I had with 'Neon Bible' is that (while it had great songs selected) musically, it lacked a unifying thread/theme--I liked to hear songs from it, but I had a hard time listening to it as one piece of work.  'Best Of' Records suffer from this...as does 'Sam's Town' but not 'Day and Age' (See Killers).  Really loved some of the B-sides from that era, like 'Broken Window'--I really think it was good enough to be on 'Neon Bible'.  IMHO 'Intervention' and 'Antichrist Television Blues' would have served better as a CD single/7\" to tide us over during the 3 year wait between records.  (Those two just didn't seem to fit musically, even though lyrically, they do fit.)'Suburbs'?  I love it.  Mainly for the same reasons I love 'Funeral', only I have to say that 'Suburbs' slightly surpasses 'Funeral'-- it's another mature work that ebbs and breathes, rocks and wanders with absolute balance and precision.  It repeats itself, not as in an annoying chorus over and over repetition-- the theme is reinforced by slipping the a repeated phrase into multiple songs, giving the phrase multiple contexts and conjuring different facets of meaning.  \"First they built the road and then they built the town.\"What the 'White Album' had in eclecticism and style, 'Suburbs' has in theme, writing and complex beauty.  I sincerely hope it goes #1 everywhere, it's just so easy to love.Also, if listening to 'Empty Room' doesn't absolutely thrill you, then congratulations, you must a very dulled musical palate from too much Merzbow in the 90's.

As one of my all-time favorite bands, I wasn't expecting it to live up to \"Funeral,\" but I also wasn't expecting the jaunty parlor piano on the opening tracks or some of the other strange departures from \"classic\" Arcade Fire on this album. By the time I got through the first 6 tracks, the only one that immediately stood out was \"Rococo,\" easily the closest song on the album to their earlier records.After listening to the whole album, it became obvious that the last half is the stronger. \"We Used to Wait,\" \"Sprawl I,\" and \"Sprawl II\" are an incredible close to the album. I started listening to this last half of the album exclusively... and when I returned to the first half of the album, it all suddenly sounded amazingly good and authentically Arcade Fire.I think the important thing here is that you have to get used to the sound of this album (especially if you're coming in to it as a huge fan of their earlier work), and when you do, it all falls in to place and the genius of it all reveals itself.If you're not loving it yet, keep listening to it, especially the second half. But don't give up on this album, because it doesn't sound just like \"Funeral.\" I don't think there will ever be another \"Funeral,\" by this band or any other.Overall, I think this is just another evolutionary stage of what will be the best indie rock band of the last decade and the one to come. When you consider their three records all together, they have probably done themselves a favor by not trying to recreate anything they have previously done and instead have created a beautiful collection of growingly diverse and brilliant styles.\n", "val": 0.03324369713664055}

I associate their albums with fictional events, just because it suits me:Funeral sends me to that moment when I hear the ice cream truck coming. I'm at the top of the big hill with my $2 in quarters in my pocket and my 4 speed bike under my feet, and just then a big smile spreads across my face.  I lean into my handle bars, and rush down as quick as I can, met by all my best friends as I race through the Neighborhood, and its pure bliss.Neon Bible is more like lying on the roof of my apartment, contemplating what I'm really doing in life, when it hits me- it doesn't matter, I'm just a miniscule part of this big machine called 'existence'- and with that I'm freed but also met with the sad beauty of life being 'insignificant'.  Nearly tearful as I leave the rooftop, I appreciate the world more than ever.The Suburbs being a little longer kind of evolves.  I'm at school walking through the halls like I know what's cool, slapping hands with my buds, catching a few glances of the old faces, friends or not, when I get to the door to history class and remember what my grades have been recently.  I know I'm doing alright but it won't be good enough for me to be a doctor like I'd hoped, but life isn't over, there's something out there.  Just as I'm feeling a little lost with how overwhleming things have been lately, my girl pops up and gives me a peck on the cheek.  I know life is big and when I look into her eyes, my worries don't disappear, but it gives me hope.  Graduation is quickly approaching, and it's scary, but I know I'll give everything I got to give my girl and I, a happy life.An unorothodox review for an unorthodox band.

{"text": "I love albums that draw you in....you listen through once, a few songs hit you.  You find yourself playing them in your head all day long.  You listen again, different songs start to come to life.  Soon, it becomes a go-to listen in the car, at home, during a walk on the iPod.  There are different things to find, but there is depth, complexity, and always more to discover.Well, this appears to be such a piece of music.  When the first two teaser songs appeared on some websites - The Suburbs and Month of May - because they were out of context, it was hard to make sense of what was about to be released.  But that first song actually sets up a remarkable experience - in a way, I consider this to be one 60 minute song with different episodes and moods and tempos, but an overall meaning.Rather than repeat some of the excellent reviews already posted - the song-by-song analyses, and the very insightful review that equates the different songs to different periods in recent rock music history (a brilliant analysis), I will just say that this is the best 3.99 I've spent in a long, long time.  All of the songs have merit, and some are positively infectious.  It is clear that great care was put into the instrumentation - nothing is out of place, and just near everything works.  Some of the songs are easy to connect to immediately - Ready to Start, Empty Room, Suburban War, and Sprawl II are near perfect and amongst the best works Arcade Fire have created.  But even what appears at first listen to be a bit of a throwaway song like Month of May fits perfectly in the track order, and builds and adds touches throughout.This music from Arcade Fire is a gift to us all - to all of us who have the patience to listen, wait, then be amazed.  And to a fifty something like me, there are so many touches of nostalgia in different genres of rock I experienced that this music brings great joy and meaning to me.  Bravo!.....So, now I've spent over a month with this CD.  Initially I gave it five stars and thought that it would age very well.  My current feeling is that this is a remarkable album, even better than I realized, and it only grows in its profoundness with time.  The songs I initially loved are now joined by those that took a bit more time - and listening to this entire album in one sitting is an amazing experience.  It has joined albums like REM's Automatic for the People and Radiohead's OK Computer in music that will always be welcome to my ears, no matter how familiar the notes.One more thing - there are a few YouTube channels that are dedicated to live Arcade Fire performances....I just hope I can see them in concert some day!one more edit - because we did see them....small venue in Charlottesville, VA, before their Bonaroo show.  So a few things - The Suburbs hasn't faded with time.  There is still more to discover, even after countless listenings.  What emerges now is nostalgia and wistfulness - this music reaches in and deeply grabs you.  And about the live show - the energy they create is just unbelievable...on a sweltering summer night, they had a few thousand people on their feet and moving and dancing for nearly two hours.  It was an experience my wife and I will never forget.\n", "val": 0.04458346962928772}

I hear new things every time---the songs are complex, nuanced, and beautiful.Some of the other reviews on here are driving me nuts.  These run the gamut from pretentious reviews comparing this band to the second coming of Alternative Music (i.e., exaggerated hyperbole) to reviews that rip them for being derivative of other bands (there is even a positive review on here that compares every song to other bands...\"this song is U2 meets REM\", \"this is Springsteen and New Order\" etc.).The fact is, ALL bands are influenced by their peers (and by music they grew up with and loved).  There really is NO completely original music around anymore free of all previous influences (not sure that there ever was!).  So for me to point out that Arcade Fire rips some of their chord progressions right out of Pixies songs or that Win Butler at times sounds like a cross between David Bowie, Black Francis (Frank Black), and David Byrne...well, what's the point? The fact is, Arcade Fire are currently one of the most eclectic and ambitious bands around.  I like how they can take what sounds like a simple pop song on the surface (\"Modern Man\", for instance) and fill it up with meaning and pathos and lots of little musical touches.  And I love how they are respectful of their influences---yes, there are many nods to new wave bands of the 80's on here---but no, they are NOT derivative.This album is probably a tad long, but its hard to complain when the music is this good.  The songs have been dancing in my head for days and, just like Funeral, I am guessing that the meaning and depth behind them will continue to emerge over time.  These guys really write songs that get into your subconscious---I mean, right now all I have to do is think of the movie \"Where the Wild Things Are\" and I can immediately hear the music and words for \"Wake Up\" in my head.If you have any appreciation at all for their past work, get this album---it's a good one.\n", "val": 0.015763618052005768}

Arcade Fire's latest, The Suburbs, will give thoughtful youngsters of today similar thrills, spills and chills.Win Butler sings his shattered heart out amongst the ruins of modern life. In his mind the safety of the suburbs is a myth. Our honest thoughts tell us he is right. Our eyes can see the damage done with more danger ahead. Win spews thoughtful lines like \"as I hide inside my private prison\" as well as beautiful ones, \"Now the cities we live in could be distant stars and I search for you in every car.\"The styles range from an almost Neil Young-like Wasted Hours to the early rock riffing of Month of May. One must not forget the ethereal gems sung by Regine Chassagne. Empty Room and The Sprawl II are epic and awesome. She is the secret weapon that puts Arcade Fire on top of the rock heap.In an age when music listeners are force fed chest thumpin' hip hop, predictable pop and generic country, Arcade Fire are here today to blaze out of one's iPod and save rock (indie or otherwise.)\n", "val": 0.03582607954740524}
{"text": "This album was well worth the wait. It is simply great. It only comes as a whole after several listens and then it becomes quite hard to peel away from it. Without leaving their unique and very distinct style, Butler and his awesome gang explore new alleys and flood us with new sounds and harmonies that sink deep into our subconscious. The Lyrics are dark but that is to be expected considering the first two albums. Every single song is worth exploring. Some will clinch onto you right away some will take time. Arcade Fire are true originals and more than a few newcomers have tried to imitate their sound, but AF are here to stay and we should all feel very blessed about that.\n", "val": 0.06535414606332779}

Incredibly creative on many levels, catchy, engaging, and unforgettable.I won't go into detail about each and every song on the album (of which there is a plentiful 16 tracks), but as a music lover in general, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh and unique.As an owner of thier two previous albums and having enjoyed them thoroughly, this album was a no-brainer for me, but I can see people of all ages with broad musical interests enjoying this album for years to come.Don't think about it, just buy it.

{"text": "The Arcade Fire set the bar increddibly high for themselves with their first two albums.  2004's Funeral was beautifully chaotic and difficult to categorize.  Neon Bible, the group's 2007 release was a darker affair that was full of anxiety and turmoil.  Both albums were indie rock masterpieces that positioned the band as a major creative force to be reckoned with.  Their newest release, the hotly anticipated \"The Suburbs\" clearly has a lot to live up to.  At first listen, this ablum appears to be the group's most conventional effort to date.  The 16 songs collected here are straight up rock anthems that find the band treading some of the same musical terrain as U2 and Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band.Yet it's never quite that simple with The Arcade Fire.  After a couple of spins through \"The Suburbs\", some suprising complexities begin to reveal themselves.  Thematically, Win Butler uses the songs on this album to ruminate on the uneasy passage from youth to adulthood and the fears and anxieties that go along with growing up.  The Suburbs is populated by characters who are uneasy with modern life and spend a lot of time looking back at their youth wondering how they ended up where they are.  In the title track, Butler cries out that he wants a daugher while he is still young; but if that's too much to ask for then he would like a son.  Elsewhere he sings that he would rather be alone than pretend that everything is ok.  On on of the album's best tracks, Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains), Butler hands over the vocal reigns to Regine Chassagne for an electronic flavored lament about trying not to be swallowed up by a modern suburban landscape that is devoid of human connections and emotion.Ultimately \"The Suburbs\" seems to be about adults tyring to reconcile their youth with their current lots in life.  Compromises were made, dreams were unrealized and things didn't turn out the way they had planned when they were young and optimistic.  If the songs on this album sound somewhat conventional, perhaps it's by design.  Each song still seems to have a ton of passion and emotion rumbling beneath the surface, as if it could all break free at any moment although the band is working to harness it.  This seems to mirror the fates of the adults on this album who still have plenty of dreams and ambitions left, but feel the need to try and conform and act their age.  The result is a constant tug of war.  Maybe it's best summed up by the songs, \"The Suburbs\" and \"The Suburbs Continued\" which serve as bookeneds to the record.  In both instances, Butler repeats the refrain, \"Sometimes I can't believe it/I'm movin' past the feeling\".  The Arcade Fire's thrid album is about keeping the fire burning, even when it feels like the flame is slowly dying.\n", "val": 0.0004318706050980836}

{"text": "If you've loved each of Arcade Fire's albums, you'll still love this one. Starting with the EP, each new turn has evolved from the turn before it, and the same is true with this album. It's not Funeral, and it's  not Neon Bible, and the band is true to itself rather than simply mimicking its earlier successes. And, at the same time, this album is clearly an extension of each of the three previous products, as it takes that storyline of America nearing an apocalypse to its conclusion (for now, at least). Like the EP and Funeral, it's almost a really, really chilled-out \"Ziggy Stardust,\" but like Neon Bible, it experiments with new arrangements and sounds without radically changing the band's style.The album does sound more produced than the previous albums, but why shouldn't it be? They're super rich now. The songs are just as powerful as on the previous records, though they seem at times more mellow and the melodies seem more subtle. As always, the arrangements, the harmonies, and maybe above all else the creepy but familiar lyrics are what make the songs unique and unforgettable. Early in the opening song, Win Butler sings: \"So you're standin on the opposite shore/But by the time the first bombs fell/We were already bored.\" Who starts an album that way? Only them.After the first day with the album, my favorite songs are: \"Empty Room\" - whenever you hear Regine start singing, it's kind of like when you saw Catwoman ride onto the Batman opening credits and knew she'd be in the episode; \"Half Light I\" and \"Half Light II\" - understated rock ballads; \"Waking Hours\" - the melody is very pretty on this one; \"Deep Blue\" - best arrangement on the album; \"Sprawl II\" - I can't even describe this one, it's so odd and so good. And just wait until you get to the very end. It's a surprise, and a cliffhanger. Who ends an album that way?If you haven't already, buy The Suburbs. You're going to like it. It's not a disappointment, just a slight and natural change in expression of the same direction.\n", "val": 0.04447532817721367}

{"text": "Arcade Fire has dropped out of sight in the last several months, so it's nice to see this insanely talented band make their grand reappearance. And their third album \"The Suburbs\" is a rich, retro-flavored expanse of truly transcendent music -- it starts off rather patchily, but soon it becomes a melodic hurricane of shimmering rock'n'roll.It starts off rather weakly with the title track, a rather bland piano-rocker. But things pick up with \"Ready to Start,\" which spins shimmering threads of keyboard around gritty earthy chords (\"Businessmen drink my blood/Like the kids in art school said they would\"). Honestly, this would have made a much better start to the album.And it sets the tone for the rest of the album -- meandering, bluesy rock'n'roll (\"Modern Man,\" \"Month of May\"), the stormy stretches of warbling keyboard and ringing guitars (\"Rococo,\" \"Wasted Hours\"), bittersweet guitar-pop (\"Suburban War\"), the elegant driving rock anthems (\"Empty Rooms,\" \"We Used To Wait\"), and languid indiepop around a catchy core (\"City with No Children\").The best songs of all are the two-part experimental ones: \"Half Light Part I\" is an exquisite twinkling little melody, and \"Part II\" is its darkly glittering counterpoint; on the other hand, \"Sprawl (Flatland)\" is a string-soaked, bittersweet song, with \"Sprawl (Mountains Beyond Mountains\" as its discoish companion.Apparently the central theme of \"The Suburbs\" is urban sprawl... which is not exactly a unique concept. But the Arcade Fire doesn't just explore the sprawl of suburbia with its \"dead shopping malls\" and lonely houses, but the loneliness of growing into adulthood and the life of an artist surrounded by \"normal\" people.As for the instrumentation, it's a little less indiepop and a little more rock'n'roll -- strong, shifting electric guitars and powerful chords, veiled with shimmering keyboard, strings and piano. And they throw in some brilliant flourishes here and there (the berserk strings in \"Empty Room\"). At the center of all this is Win Butler and Rgine Chassagne -- his falsetto voice murmurs through most of the songs, but is sometimes accompanied by her clear sweet one.And their brilliant lyrical skills are evident in every song -- there are some wicked bits of satire (\"They seem wild but they are so tame/They're moving towards you with their colors all the same\" -- take that, hipsters!), and exquisite lyricism (\"Now the cities we live in could be distant stars/And I searched for you in every passing car\").The Arcade Fire's \"The Suburbs\" takes a little while to fully warm up, but it ends up being a lonely, bittersweet exploration of an artist's life in suburbia.

{"text": "I LOVE the new Arcade Fire CD \"The Suburbs\".It might not have some of the innocent charm of the first two albums, but it is so good and so perfectly executed that it will have broad-ranging appeal and will make them into something even bigger than they already are.When I hear this album, the word 'GRAND' comes to mind.  I hear good, full, orchestrated song arrangements that soar and glide; melodic, accessible rock/pop songs that draw me in; and thoughtful lyrics which stir feelings.Win Butler is a very good songwriter, and in this presentation his voice should be less of an acquired taste for many listeners. Less warble, but no less emotional wail.  Joy, sorrow, exhilaration... this album has it all.  Like their first albums this one is a also a tempest in a teapot, just with a more streamlined sound this time.If they sound more mainstream or more produced than on \"Funeral\" and \"Neon Bible\", that is fine with me.  I am not concerned if they are broadening their appeal, because I believe more people should hear this music and get in on just how wonderful the Arcade Fire is.\"The Suburbs\" will come to be thought of by many as a rock and roll classic.  It will be considered one of the best albums of 2010.  And not just because I say so!  Hear it, and you will know this is true.So just go buy it right now!

{"text": "Ok, I realize the year is a long way from over, but I can't imagine any albums are going to be better then this one. A word of warning though, this album is the very definition of a \"grower.\" It took me at least 7 spins before I started to really like it, but in my opinion at least that is always the sign of a really good album.My favorite songs (so far) are the Suburbs, Suburban War, Used to Wait, and the awesome Sprawl 2, which sounds like an 80's song.So is this album better then Funeral? That is hard to say. I love funeral because so many of the songs are so athemic and really get the blood boiling. These songs aren't as anthem oriented and sneak up on you a little more. I think for that reason the album might initially dissapoint fans of songs such as \"Intervention\" (from Neon Bible) or many of the songs on Funeral such as \"Wake Up\" or \"Neighborhood 1.\"My only big complaint is that the album is two to three songs too long. This is somewhat ironic as the two albums I was most eagerly looking forwward to this year were this album and Congratultions by MGMT. I feel that Congratulations is too short and that The Suburbs is too long. There aren't really any bad songs, but I think if they had eliminated two to three songs (Wasted Hours, Deep Blue, Spraw 1) then this album would have benefited as there wouldn't have been any loss of momentum.But this album is so good that it still deserves 5 stars. I know a lot of people have talked about Arcade Fire being the next supergroup alongside Coldplay or U2, but I'm not sure this is the album that will push them to that level just because there aren't any obvious singles that are going to appeal to the masses. In that regard Arcade Fire remain very much an indie band. But regardless of the label, they are one of the best bands out there and the Suburbs continues their evolution as a great band\n", "val": 0.02156514674425125}
{"text": "I often find myself startled by the number of indie rock fans I encounter who rank Arcade Fire's Neon Bible above Funeral.  Why?  I always regarded the album as being emotionally overwrought (bordering on contrived) and heavy handed.  That's not to say I don't love a lot of the songs for their musical composition, but I do regard many of the record's lyrics as being overly dramatic and self-righteous with the way they frequently describe modern life as threatened by external influences (e.g. Religious Faith and Big Business).  Said more plainly, while Funeral did a remarkable job of documenting the individual's experience of emotional suffering, Neon Bible's attempts at naming the sources responsible for this anguish came off as simultaneously bombastic, and a bit hollow.That being said, I didn't have the highest critical expectations for The Suburbs.  Despite many of these critiques, however, The Suburbs is an album that does an excellent job of avoiding many of problems I had with Neon Bible.  Accordingly, it reflects some smart artistic moves made by the group, and most importantly, demonstrates the Arcade Fire as a band actually capable of change.At sixteen tracks, there's certainly a lot of music on the album, and most of it's really good.  Likewise, it's pretty much what you've come to expect of Arcade Fire: Highly expressive rock songs featuring the affected vocals of Win Butler (and occasionally Rgine Chassagne) that receive garnish via unique orchestral flourishes and interesting instrument choices.However, in contrast to the bustling, turbo-charged arrangements of their first two records, at least half of The Suburbs' tracks' are considerably more relaxed, beginning with the easy shuffle of the title track and \"Deep Blue\", to the patient folk-jam of \"City With No Children\", and the militant, slow building \"Wasted Hours\".  Likewise, the languid nature of much of the album's material is thematically appropriate, given that the suburbs are generally seen as offering relief from the risks and stresses accompanying city life: Life in the suburbs is usually less fast paced, in addition to offering comforting distance (both geographic and psychological) from looming metropolises.  Though you can't really expect Arcade Fire to make music that praises a subject uniformly, the suburbs represent a great thematic vantage point for Win Butler's descriptions of emotional unease.There's also a noticeably self-referential quality to the album's lyrics, with Butler occasionally making (less than complimentary) lyrical nods to his band's eminent position on the indie music scene.  The sluggish \"Rococo\" is stinging indictment of current trends in music fandom.  In addition to describing treacherous windstorms impact on a Canadian community, \"Month of May\", Butler unexpectedly includes the observation that \"the kids are still standin' with their arms folded tight\", which is a juxtaposition inviting the conclusion that Butler views hipsters and Mother Nature as similar with regards to their merciless disregard for the efforts of others.Located near the album's close, \"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\" represents a clearly identifiable centerpiece.  Bearing substantial resemblance to Funeral's \"Haiti\", the track features a lead vocal from Rgine Chassagne, a four-on-the-floor drum beat, and a heavy use of electric organs and keyboards that evoke Caribbean environs.  The entire affair is somewhat reminiscent of Talking Head's New Wave-gospel stomp, \"Road to Nowhere\", though \"Sprawl II\" (to its credit) is both more lyrically reverential and sonically expansive.  The track is a triumph in the sense that despite its' pessimistic lyrics that depict the suburbs' as a source of social influence stressing undesirable uniformity, the song's music speaks to the satisfaction of resisting to conform, and the noticeable incongruence between the song's music and lyrics convey this oft-repeated lesson in a manner that proves neither clichd nor trite.In sum, The Suburbs is a very good album that will probably continue to be fairly well regarded within Arcade Fire's catalogue.  Again, at sixteen tracks, the record is a bit lengthy.  Though it's hard to say that much of the album's material is \"bad\" by any stretch of the imagination, it may lack some of the immediate payoff offered by the band's earlier efforts.  The Suburbs may still feature a bit of the didactic sentiment found on Neon Bible, these elements are considerably less predominant, ultimately providing a listening experience more in line with what we want from Arcade Fire.\n", "val": 0.02440820261836052}
{"text": "I come to this as an outsider - I have previously listened to a few Arcade Fire songs (or watched videos) because of friends who like them.  There was a lot of build up to this release, so when I saw it was only $3.99 I thought I would check it out with little to loose.  Just because I won't give it 5 stars, some will hate this review - fine, but this is my honest opinion.I really wanted to like this album.  But I'm not an uncritical fanboy, so I can't.  Sure, I don't hate it, it isn't bad.  But it isn't special like some would have you believe.  Don't drink that Kool Aid blindly.My favorite part of the album as a whole is the overall ebb and flow of pace and style that keeps it at least interesting and listenable.  It is music you can put on while driving down the road, and then tune out while you think of something else. But that isn't what I want in my music.  I want it to grab me, to change me, to make me feel something, but mostly all I get from this is indifferent meh.Some of the tracks really seem like they are trying to hard to be different.  There is nothing wrong with different, but being different just to be different almost never works out unless your name is Beck.1. The Suburbs - solid start, creative and catchy.2. Ready to Start - R.E.M. does this better.  So did The Cure.3. Modern Man - It's like they stole it from 80's Devo and modernized it.  Not bad!4. Rococo - I like the rich musical sound, but the vocals don't add to it.5. Empty Room - U2 meets Bjork.  Not bad, but not great either.6. City With No Children - U2 does this so much better.7. Half Light I - Modern Pink Floyd - really good!8. Half Light II (No Celebration) - Kinda Faith No More cross with INXS - and I really like it!9. Suburban War - a modern take on acid rock?  Wanted to like it, but can't.10. Month of May - This one should be really high energy in concert, but doesn't seem to translate on the album.11. Wasted Hours - Love it!  Catchy, makes you want to air strum along.12. Deep Blue - This is the rich sound like Rococo, but I like it much better. The vocals add to it here. Probably my favorite track.13. We Used to Wait - Like the lyrics, you can keep the music.14. Sprawl I (Flatland) - Good emotional \"feeling\" song.  Easily blends into the background of life.15. Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains) - Ace of Bass?  ABBA?  Really?16. The Suburbs (continued) - Like Neil Young might sound today if he were 35 years younger.  And that's a good thing.  Great end to the album.\n", "val": 0.010373829863965511}
{"text": "After waiting for what seems like a millennium since their last official release, we finally get The Suburbs, an engaging indie rock record full of pop gems.  Here's my track by track take on it...The Suburbs - A weak start to an otherwise awesome album, this song was released as the first unofficial single.  When I first heard this song before the album was released, it greatly lowered my expectations. It's terribly repetitive.  (2/10)Ready to Start - This song marks the true beginning of the album, in my mind.  The Strokes-y drum and bass coordination kick-start the song and drive it into one of the most poignant, catchy choruses on the album.  (10/10)Modern Man - I love a good song with a time signature that throws you off then becomes one of your favorites.  (9/10)Rococo - With its chanted tribal chorus, this song brings to mind memories of their debut album, \"Funeral.\"  It's a good example of standard, epic Arcade Fire fare.  (8/10)Empty Room - This is my favorite song on the album, without a doubt.  The frenzied strings lead you into the trap and then like the distortion kicks in and knocks you out of your chair.  This reminds me of The Rentals.  (10/10)City With No Children - The Springsteen influence once again becomes apparent.  Thank God they know how to use it.  (8/10)Half Light I & II - The first half is not as amazing as the second, but it serves as a good lead in.  (6/10)/(8/10)Suburban War - I've seen some people make the case that this album is overproduced (mainly due to tracks like this), but I'd have to disagree.  It's well produced, but not overly so.  I think this track a perfect example of the right amount of indie/pop production a great Arcade Fire song requires.  (8/10)Month of May - I'm not in love with this song.  It reminds me of the grungier side of Yo La Tengo, but it sounds like one of their tracks I would skip.  (5/10)Wasted Hours - The vocal melody and lyrics immediately linger in your memory long after hearing this song.  (9/10)Deep Blue - The album starts to get a little sleepy at this point.  During my first listen, it was harder to differentiate the songs toward the end of the album, which made them slightly less memorable.  This song trots along at a blues bar pace but doesn't stay with you for long afterward.  (6/10)We Used to Wait - Things are still a bit worn out as this song plays, but a few interesting elements are introduced into the mix, such as a Modest Mouse-like guitar riff that noodles around in the piano hits.  (7/10)Sprawl I - Perhaps the sleepiest song yet, Sprawl I crawls around but its melancholy melody saves it from being a failure.  (6/10)Sprawl II - The alarm clock finally went off.  This could easily be the next single.  The catchy 80's all-girl vocals are infectious.  This track is an obvious standout and an instant favorite.  (10/10)The Suburbs (continued) - Somehow, the lead-out with the same name as the lead-in is at least ten times better.  How?  I don't know.  (8/10)Overall, the album felt a little bloated at times.  But if you sift through the slower songs, there are moments of musical brilliance to be found.  Thanks for reading!***A note to other people on Amazon who have given this album a rating of less than 5 stars: Don't delete your review just because some pretentious hipsters have been clicking the 'not helpful' button!

Although I prefer music on CD, I like getting MP3s for this purpose.  I can pick and choose the songs I want and the sound quality is most likely better than that of the original 45RPM  vinyl record.  45s tended to be pressed on what was called re-grind.  That's melted down vinyl records that didn't sell - ofttimes Xmas LPs.  Sometimes they scraped off the paper label before the melting and sometimes they didn't,  That led to more surface noise on the pressing made from re-grind.  There's no surface noise on the MP3.Anyway, this tune does exactly what it says when you need a little bit o'soul to see you through.\n", "val": 9.043434693012387e-05}

The last one minute and 45 seconds of the song consist of repeating the phrase \"you're the sweetest thing\" over and over, with the kind of soul singer fills you'd expect between repetitions, like \"darlin' I want you to know\".

The best surprise was that several months later I was in Seattle on a business trip and on a whim caught an ad that announced that Brettina was playing at a local concert auditorium that Sunday. So I stayed an extra day and caught the show that night. Wow...what an experience. She opened with a classic Nancy Wilson song and blew the house down on the first number. I was impressed as I am a Jazz affection-ado (used to play a lot of it in earlier years). Then she went into a set comprised of her CD material. The vibe between her and the musicians was so smooth and yet playful. The whole show was almost a surreal feeling...as if you were experiencing one of those \"memorable\"moments of your life. Like \"I remember when I first saw her in concert....\" I as well as everyone else really enjoyed the show and I can't wait to see what she creates next. PS....wouldn't mind seeing that show again.

I contacted Amazon to tell them about my disappointment and had to fill out out a comment box and Amazon was going to forward my questions to the place I bought the CD from (the CD came from a third party) The third party emailed me  and  said that the address that the CD was mailed from was where the mail had always been sent from (Brooklyn) and that they don't know where I got that it was coming from Ohio! (Ohio was where the store was that i was to get the CD from). I feel like I have been suckered into buying something that was misrepresented!

Not just because of the memories, but because the music is so damn good.  Shel Silverstein, Dr. Hook and the others play some crankin' tunes, and it's impossible to feel down when you sing along to \"Polly in a Porny\".Perhaps the most compelling thing I can say about this album is that my ex-wife absolutely hated it (She was the Kenny-G type, but a great \"Thumbsucker\").

{"text": "By profession, Shel Silverstein was a cartoonist and his work has appeared in several American magazines; he has also written poetry, plays, short stories and a number of children's books. His prowess as a song writer came to the attention of the record buying public via the music of a bunch of loonies collectively known as Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show. Shel wrote many songs for this band - the best known ones include : 'Sylvia's Mother', 'The Cover of The Rolling Stone', and 'The Ballad of Lucy Jordan'; Dr. Hook have also covered a number of the songs to be found on this album. The album was originally released in 1969 and it was re-issued on CD (with 3 bonus tracks) in 1999, following Shel's death.Shel's vocal style is an acquired taste and this album typifies that style - he can be heard growling, wheezing and cackling his way through the songs (he also manages to sing on the odd occasion). Instrumental and vocal accompaniment are provided by Dr. Hook (amongst others) - including Dennis Locorriere (or is it Ray Sawyer?) joining in with spasms of maniacal laughter from time to time.With this album, you get a taste of Shel's personal worldview as he turns his attention to popular counterculture of the late 1960s. With some of the songs, by using a combination of parody, satire and innuendo, he proffers a tongue in cheek challenge to the (then) received wisdom of liberal attitudes towards sex and drugs. I say 'tongue in cheek' because I get the distinct impression that he doesn't exactly disapprove either; he is simply being a realist by pointing out that over-indulgence does have its downside - with the tacit implication that anyone who thinks otherwise is ever so slightly delusional. Not all of the songs deal with the themes of sex and/or drugs - there are a good few others that are just plain weird.Some cogitations upon the meaning of life :I GOT STONED AND I MISSED IT - A song which exemplifies the classic dichotomy presented by drug induced oblivion, i.e. on the one hand, by removing inhibitions, you are encouraged to do it; whilst on the other, it means you can't remember what it was you did (or who you did it with).FREAKIN' AT THE FREAKERS BALL - The song revolves around a gaggle of sado-masochists, necrophiliacs and others with esoteric recreational interests; ordinary folks just trying to loosen up a bit after a hard day at the office - with friends like this, who needs enemas?DON'T GIVE A DOSE TO THE ONE YOU LOVE MOST - A cautionary tale of life, love and sexually transmitted diseases; an ode to the man who has been given everything (except penicillin).LIBERATED LADY - A celebration of the dubious benefits of 'role reversal' - misogynists may have some difficulty coming to terms with the song's ethos.EVERYONE'S MAKIN' IT BIG BUT ME - Not, as the song's title might imply, a lament from a guy who is experiencing an episode of hydraulic dysfunction. The song is merely an expression of puzzlement - about why the trappings of superstardom should be so elusive.I rarely play this album now but, at the same time, I would never bin it. It's a memento of a period in my life when things were so very different - those were the days (or were they?). There are various Shel Silverstein compilations, and these cover a broader range of his song writing styles. However, if you are looking for sardonic humour, then you can't get much better than 'Freakers' - but seriously folks, not recommended listening for those who are excessively prudish.\n", "val": 0.0052256197668612}

{"text": "This is a pretty awesome set. My first introduction to the Scorpions was when I heard \"no One Like You.\" There followed several other songs like \"Wind of Change\", \"Send Me An Angel\", \"Raised on Rock\", and several more. I didn't just want a \"Best of\" Compilation with maybe 10 tracks. 2 CD's and 20 tracks pretty much speaks for itself. You get a nice survey while still leaving room for your taste to grow.For some reason the track listing in the item description is not correct. Here is what was on the set I received:CD 11.  Humanity2.  Lorelei3.  Wind of Change4.  Send Me an Angel5.  You and I6.  Holiday7.  Still Loving You8.  The Future Never Dies9.  Moment of Glory10.  Living for Tomorrow11.  Does Anyone Know12.  Believe in Love13.  When Love Kills Love14.  Under the Same Sun15.  The Best is Yet to ComeCD 21.  Raised on Rock2.  Hour 13.  The Game of Life4.  Rock Zone5.  Don't Believe Her6.  No One Like You7.  Rock You Like a Hurricane8.  Blackout9.  Bad Boys Running Wild10.  Can't Live Without You11.  He's a Woman She's a Man12.  Pictured Life13.  Make it Real14.  Rhythm of Love15.  Can't Explain16.  Remember the Good Times (Retro Garage Mix)17.  Wild child18.  Alien Nation19.  The Good Die Young20.  We Will Rise AgainThe sound is really good - a little compressed at times, but not the over-miked, mashed-together garbage sound that is inflicted on a lot of newer bands these days. The case I received was a tri-fold cardboard affair, not a traditional plastic CD double set case.Anyway, love the set, and if you are just getting started on the Scorpions, or looking to get someone started on them, this is a great introduction.\n", "val": 0.007123474031686783}

He has a very gothic look in the video, and he pulls it off very well. Listening to this song can remind you of someone that is addicting to you in a sensual kind of way, and vice versa (you being addictive to them).

{"text": "This is two part review coming from different perspectives.  If you're a Christian looking for faith affirming metal music, part 1 is for you.  If you're not a Christian, Part 2 is for you.Part 1:  The Showdown for sometime has been understood to be a Christian band according to my research.  After hearing this CD, I'd have to say that it would be difficult to convict them of being Christians at all.  The overt focus on Suicide, Evil, Digging your own grave and Hell makes it difficult find a positive message, an encouraging word, or uplifting thought here.  This is the first album from The Showdown that I've purchased, I haven't heard any of the others, if I had it to do over, I wouldn't have purchased it.  The most \"Christian\" lyric appears in the song \"Bring it Down\" which says, \"Respect only to God\" but that lyric isn't expounded on much.  If you're looking for smart Christian metal with depth, give Project 86 a look...Part 2: I do have to hand it to The Showdown, I give this album 5 stars from a musical standpoint.  The riffs are tight and smart, love the harmonics, and the vocals.  The mixing and recording is top notch and I really like the way the drums are miked/processed.  The sharp kick bass click reminds me of old Pantera, well done guys.  I'm not so much into the death metal growling, but that's just personal preference.  I'm in my mid 30's and my metal influences stem back to the mid 80's.  I hear strong Zakk Wylde, Pantera, Metallica, Slayer (just a bit), and others..  From a musical standpoint, this is a fantastic metal album that would be worthy in any heavy metal fans library.I gave this review 3 stars because I expect a bit more from my Christian brothers.  99% of everything I own musically is from Christian bands and when I buy music, I desire a little more depth lyrically than whats here.  I must emphasize though that there isn't ONE SINGLE profane word on this album, and I really appreciate that.  The Showdown, regardless of your spiritual loyalties, thank you for producing a Metal album devoid profanity and sexual references. That alone is worth high regard.\n", "val": 0.009831218980252743}
{"text": "I've had this for about 3 weeks now and it's left my car stereo for only a few short moments. this cd is absolutely amazing and heavy and F***  even the two slower songs ( Take me home and Digging my own grave ) which are both amazing in there own right, but I can't remember when I listened to a cd this many times over and haven't tired of it yet.  there is not one week song on this cd, but I do usually listen to more death metal and thrash, and find it funny or odd that the one song I find myself skipping over from time to time is #3 which i find kind of ironic... but the songs I do love and there are many... A man named Hel - Heavy lies the crown( 2:08- 2:36 ) my favorite stretch of music on the entire cd, heavy as hell catchy and makes me feel like i could tear down a concrete wall with my bear knuckles  - Take me home - Blood in the gears... I could seriously put all the songs on this list, but I will keep it at those ones that stick out a little more for me... If you like any sorta metal then you owe it to yourself to buy Blood in the Gears, this cd bleeds metal out of every pore , I've listened to some good cd's this year but this could possibly end up being my favorite one of the entire year... This cd is a beast... nothing drowns out those kids in there decked out $2000 cars playing there Rap and Hip Hop better then this cd... this cd is meant to be played loud with the windows down... enjoy...\n", "val": 0.0021486023906618357}

{"text": "The Showdown have come a long long way.  I saw them live back in 2004 and they were energetic and fun but hardly memorable.  2008's \"Back Breaker\" saw their sound become honed and refined towards the southern rock spectrum and now with \"Blood in the Gears,\" we are treated to some ultra-macho, chest-pounding, riffs-with-rabies Johnny Rebel groove metal the likes of which we've never seen.The Showdown take nasty, snarling southern riffs and blends them with hardcore energy and urgency, and what comes out of the oven is guaranteed to get every head banging within earshot.  There's groove a-plenty, with a little melody and emotion here and there but this isn't soul-baring metalcore.  Oh no, this is locked-'n-loaded, leather jacket and metal studs man's man metal.  And it is absolutely buck wild.  Not the fastest or heaviest fish in the barrel but the energy is so infectious, I can't get it out of my head.  You'll hear numerous influences, from Metallica to Pantera to Hatebreed, but this is no copycat.  It takes the macho swagger from early 90's thrash and flings in into a 21st century circle pit.

Though it is a much better produced song than her earlier album, and Snopp Dogg was a smart addition in the end it is still a Katy Perry song that will soon be heard only once a quarter on your local \"We play everything pop\" radio station.

{"text": "After four consecutive number one singles, what is a girl supposed to do? If you're Katy Perry, you go for broke and release what you hope to be a FIFTH number one from the same album, a feat unaccomplished since Michael Jackson's 'Bad'.Last Friday Night may not be the finest pop song upon first listen. It's fun, to be sure, but there's nothing particularly exceptional about it. 'E.T.' had it's stuttering bits paired with cold synths, 'Firework' had that soaring chorus, 'Teenage Dream' had Max Martin, which is all an artist really needs, and 'California Gurls' had, well, Snoop Dogg. That's enough about that.Well, Last Friday Night has a freaking saxophone. Yes, prior to Gaga's 'Edge of Glory', Katy was bringing the saxophone back on her own track. That, paired with the chanting and that darn hook make the 'epic fail' lyric not only forgivable but actually okay. This song could jump right out of an 80's movie, which the video exemplifies brilliantly.This song may not have been a number one if not for the fact that it was released just as summer was kicking off, serving as the perfect anthem when no song had claimed the title quite yet. It may not have been number one if not for absolutely amazing video, which jettisoned the song from number 20 on iTunes to number 1. And it may not have been number one if not for that damn saxophone solo.Bottom line: Katy has scored her THIRD song of the summer in two consecutive summers. Well done, Ms. Perry.\n", "val": 0.001916131004691124}
{"text": "Thought this was Kesha when I first heard it (\"...glitter all over the room....\"), and, to tell you the truth here, once I found out that it wasn't Kesha, I branded it instantly as a Kesha ripoff. The glitter reference, the Tik-Tok vibe (and tone)... I thought, \"yeah, that a blatant steal, man. Kesha ought to go right ahead and demand the frigging royalties. ALL OF THEM.\"But the truth is: IT IS NO SUCH THING.You know, it's strange how pop music seems to finds a consensus-theme within the record buying public. FRIDAY is actually the fifth single from Perry's album -- she wasn't trying to copy Kesha at all (check the dates of release(s)) -- I'm just saying that to think she was writing essentially the same stuff as Kesha was at almost the same time, purely by accident, is bizarre.But hey, there it is.FRIDAY is in the headache-to-read key of D-sharp minor (6 sharps!), which means that it was almost certainly written on keyboard... yet the strummy guitars give the track a different vibe (as they're used here) while still holding the headache \"keyboard\" key -- and the final result is damned interesting. The song seems to walk a tightrope between positive & negative vibes: the 6 sharps \"should\" give the song a buzzy, positive vibe (a \"feel\" that the intelligent use of guitar here seems to take away) while simultaneously being held in a minor key throughout \"should\" (again, in theory, here) give the song something of a down-vibe -- which the intelligent use of guitar here also takes away. In other words, it's like somebody sanded down the extreme edges on both sides of a box of chaos, and left nothing but a simple and very cool middle that manages to somehow not sound sterilized. It's interesting that the lyrics (which basically say that, hey... you know, we did all of this stupid stuff... but it's totally cool, no biggie...) strike a positive/negative message, and the music is able to correctly fit that, all because the tambre of the strummed guitar within D-sharp minor permits it. It's some pretty sophisticated thinking, and I absolutely like the result.I consider work like this to be experimental, although I do like it when an artist does try it -- and so few do anymore. She won't be able to repeat this, though... (Stevie Wonder has already done the inverse(s)).It's worth 5 stars: 4 for the track itself, plus an extra star for simply being so willing to throw the rulebook away and take a chaotic jigsaw puzzle of disparate musical ideas and mesh them together so perfectly.Kinda cool to see somebody willing to still do this kind of thing on the big chart (aside from Stevie Wonder, that is).Props.It's good work.\n", "val": 0.0005163973546586931}
{"text": "There is no question that when it has came down to Katy Perry, she has shown that there can sometimes be too much of a sex kitten to make music for. It can be good for some, but in her case it is a bunch of junk. Her latest single, E.T., the 4th single from her sophmore album Teenage Dream isn't really a driven song. She feels more like she is trying so much to be like the music that Lady Gaga. I really didn't like the song at all. It really is even worse than her California Gurls had showed last summer. The single version with Kanye West is also just as bad. I would definitely pass this song up, and go for someone who has a real voice, and not a E.T.Song: D-\n", "val": 9.773357305675745e-06}

The lyrics paint a picture of someone who is slightly guarded until they meet someone that makes them feel comfortable enough to let go and be themselves. Then they have fun together. I haven't actually heard it on the radio in the car yet, but I can picture it being a great song to blast on the radio with the windows down.Don't get me wrong, I HAVE heard it on the radio just not in the car. But anyway, this song is one of the few songs on the album with a pop-rock appeal ('Hummingbird Heartbeat' being the other).The video showcases a bunch of young adults having fun on the beach and in the water, dancing and just doing things that young people enjoy! It is slightly racy but nothing we haven't seen before.'Teenage Dream' gets two thumbs way up.

{"text": "The rating I give is based on how much I like the song.  My opinionI don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.But youtube exists now.

Katy is talented, she can sing, and she likes to write music. I really wish the real artists would stop allowing the pathetic pretentious artists (like Kanye) ruin their music. And yeh, I can judge Kanye. My accomplishments to date surpass his over and over and over and over. In fact, I saw a two kids selling kool-aid last month from their front yard and their accomplishments are far better than what this mule has done.

The nerd has head gear, the jock is in his letterman jacket, the hot girls are covered in makeup and pounds of hair spray. But its not just visually well done, its substance is perfect too. There is needless exposition to introduce the video and it has named characters. It covers many late 80s trends including cameos (Cory Feldman, Kenny G...), a cross over with rebecca black, references, and even has a solo by 80s musician Kenny G.Its hard to hate the flaws in this video... the chants of irrelevant phrase \"TGIF\" had me laughing instead of eye rolling, and the horribly done product placement for Just Dance is so transparent its harmless.Oh yeah and the song is good too.So good.

{"text": "The rating I give is based on how much I like the song.  My opinionI don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.But youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.I guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review... Seriously though, I love the fact that amazon hosts customer reviews, but it's a bit unnecessary for individual songs.\n", "val": 1.9730076019186527e-05}

It's almost as if Katy Perry and the sound department were battling each other and Katy Perry won because the sounds behind her voice are almost timid and don't have an equal relationship to her.

The first single \"Little White church\" is sassy and fun with its cheeky lyrics and contagious hand claps. \"Life Rolls On\" is probably the second-most singable song on the CD and is really positive. I love Phillip's husky vocals on \"All Over Again\" and \"Kiss Goodbye\", it is awesome how they switch up leads and everything clicks so well. Karen owns \"Shut Up Train\", a very simple bluesy song, that is so haunting. And \"You Can't Have Everything\" is a fantastic COUNTRY song that Kimberly sings like a bird and the pedal steel is over the top. \"Lean Into It\" has a great message and \"Why Oh Why\" with its great guitar riffs and tight harmonies. One of the best new CDs this year.\n", "val": 0.047735318541526794}

{"text": "Wayne Kirkpatrick produced 3 albums with Little Big Town.  He produced The Reason Why. Little Big Town's album cuts are as good as their singles. They are awesome with their relentless harmony! Not many groups have 4 lead singers. LBT uses an assortment of instruments: guitars, bass, drums, fiddle, mandolin, banjo, dobro and steel.They incorporate every genre: country, rock, pop, bluegrass, folk and gospel, and they put their own stamp on it. Theirs is the first music I have liked since Shania. There are some fine songs on The Reason Why:1 \"LITTLE WHITE CHURCH\" - In the video, Karen Fairchild struts out of the house, her dominatrix side asserting itself! The others are waiting on the bridge. Fairchild has an intensity about her that makes her the leader. Does she really cock her eyebrow when she sings \"free?\" Suddenly, the 4 are on the bandstand. \"No more chicken and gravy!\" The groom fails to show.2 \"SHUT UP TRAIN\" reminded me of my mother. She hated trains, and so do I. Fairchild sings the lead in an exceptional black & white video.3 \"YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING\" sets the perfect country scene: wildflowers, a willow tree and a driveway leading to a dream house. The only thing missing is love. Kimberly sings this traditional country tear jerker. We know a marriage is in trouble when lonely halls \"weep.\"4 \"THE REASON WHY\" is the title track. It is an upbeat love song, and Jimi and Karen sang it to each other on The Late Late Show.\n", "val": 0.002913081320002675}

{"text": "Loved this album. \"Little White Church\" is good enough and was definitely the right choice for the single, but the overall album offers much more. The harmonies are terrific, and the style of the songs varies from folk-rock, traditional country, and alternative country, all with the polish and sheen in the production that you'd expect from Nashville. It's a little too glossy for my usual tastes, but the songs are very well-written and unique enough that I don't mind. The opener \"The Reason Why\" has a rootsy, Sheryl Crow-esque vibe. \"You Can't Have Everything\" has a more traditional sound, with Kimberly on lead vocal, which is refreshing. Karen's rich, smokey alto may deserve the spotlight it's received, but Kimberly has a sensitivity in her delivery that is equally powerful, especially on quieter songs. I will say that if you like their version of \"Rain on a Tin Roof\", you should definitely check out Julie (not Julia) Robert's version of the song from her 2004 self-titled album. Little Big Town's perspective shift is interesting enough (here, it's sung from the man's perspective), but it's a case where the group harmonies and heavier production overwhelm the longing and lonesomeness of the song's subject matter, which Julie captured perfectly. It's a stellar album, and very fresh sounding for mainstream country music. If all this sounds good, I definitely recommend checking it out. Even if you weren't necessarily a fan of \"Little White Church,\" it wouldn't hurt to sample the rest of the album, because there really is a lot of variety here.\n", "val": 0.034493353217840195}

{"text": "Little Big Town has done it again with their beautiful harmonies and catchy beats and lyrics. One thing great about LBT is that they switch who sings lead based on the song (and then they all sing harmonies) so each song sounds unique.Here's a breakdown of the songs:The Reason Why - A great uptempo love song. You really can't help but sing along and smile. Best showcases their powerful harmonies. 9/10 starsRunaway Train - Personally, one of my least favorite songs on the album, but still relatively solid. Upbeat and fun, but the lyrics aren't anything special.  6/10Kiss Goodbye - The best song on The Reason Why. Sad, yet... so graceful and beautiful. It's really hard to describe; just go listen to it. You won't regret it. 9.8/10Shut Up Train - Karen sings lead on this song, and she does it very well in this purposefully depressing number.  It's pretty good, but harder to relate to because not too many people have spent time depressed, crying on a train... maybe I could be wrong, but I've never even been on a train. Although the song is still good, if you're looking for a sad song, go with Kiss Goodbye. It's better written and is more relate-able. 7/10Why, Oh Why - This is an anthemic, shout in someone's face song. Eh, it's not bad, but has been done better in previous LBT CDs and by other artists. 6.5/10Little White Church - Such a fun song! Gotta love the in your face lyrics combined with the catchy hand clapping. Karen sings lead on this song too. 8/10You Can't Have Everything - Sad song, about someone having the \"perfect\" life, except for the fact that their spouse doesn't truly love them. Kinda interesting in that no one has tackled this subject this way before, but not really relatable to those of us who aren't married or are happily married. 7/10All The Way Down - Love it! I love the old time record sound at the beginning and then how it transitions to a more modern sound. Lead singer switches off. 8.5/10All Over Again - Second best song here. Such a real love song. It's about two people falling in love \"all over again\". Nice unique concept for a love song that isn't done too often... it just seems so real and honest.  9.5/10Rain On A Tin Roof - Great song about how it feels when you know being with a person is a bad idea/hurtful, but yet you can't help but be with them every time they come crawling back. 9.2/10Life Rolls On - Such a happy song! Lovin' the line \"I don't know, but I've been told, if you ain't busy livin' then you're getting old. It always seems to make good sense to me.\" This song is sung to perfection by Jimi. 8.7/10Lean Into It - Great ending to a great album; about how everything will be okay, your problems will go away, and you can overcome anything life throws at you. 9/10If you are already a fan of LBT, I bet you'll enjoy The Reason Why. If you are looking into their music for the first time, I would go with either this CD or A Place To Land is a close second. Although LBT isn't very popular, they do get a decent amour of critical acclaim, and they were recently nominated for a Grammy.  They are so great because of their unique sound, of how they effortlessly blend older country with the more modern style. The harmonies are just the icing on the cake.\n", "val": 0.024793030694127083}

{"text": "Bottom-Line: In the final analysis, \"The Reason Why\" is a solid album, well produced, engineered, and performed, but it draws more heavily from contemporary stimuli than the quartets' previous offerings.The opening track (The Reason Why) for Little Big Town's latest album, \"The Reason Why\" (2010) gave me hope that I was in for the same genre defining music that was so much a part of their last three studio releases.  The lush 4-part harmony was there, as was the sumptuous C&W instrumentation that so mark Little Big Town as a creation of the country's authentic hinterland music.  Yes, there are wisps of The Eagles--or Fleetwood Mac if you prefer--on the track, but this is vintage Little Big Town and I enjoyed the ride.The very next track, Runaway Train, jumped the musical track from contemporary C&W to Pop/Rock almost too seamlessly and there went my enjoyment of this CD, well almost.  The strong vocals were still present, but something else was there as well: heavy electric guitar licks that all but covered up the signature 4-part harmony that has kept me coming back to Little Big Town's music album after album.Perhaps it is the lack of \"real\" commercial success that has caused the quartet to decide to go Pop/Rock, playing the \"if you can't beat em' join em' game.\"  It's a mystery to me why the group with it authentic C&W sound has failed to garner the critical acclaim and commercial success their talent deserves.  After all they are far and away more authentically C&W and artistically capable than Lady Antebellum, Sugarland (sadly), Rascal Flatts, Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, or a plethora of other acts out of Nashville of late that have seen critical and commercial achievement.While some of \"The Reason Why\" holds true to Little Big Town's well-crafted C&W formula, the majority of the CD seems like a deliberate effort to distance itself from what came before, relying instead on (some) over-produced pop/rock inspired instrumentation and solo vocals by the band's strongest soloist, Karen Fairchild; track No. 4 Shut Up Train for example.Fairchild is back as a soloist on track No. 6 Little White Church, which musically harkens back to the group's earlier efforts, making wonderful use of those blues riffs in its verses and chorus.  It was the first single from The Reason Why and I have to say it is one of the best tracks since they broke out with Boondocks some five years ago on The Road to Here.  The track is quintessential Country and is seriously fun to listen to.While Little White Church is the clear standout on the CD, the rest of \"The Reason Why\" is solid, but with a Pop/Rock flavor that just doesn't set well with my musical ear that had readied itself for more of what came before only to be disappointed.  Track No. 7 You Can't Have Everything, earns honorable mention because the song at least makes use of traditional C&W instruments on this decidedly melancholy number.  Anther honorable mention goes to track No. 10 Rain On A Tin Roof, which I first heard on Julie Roberts' self-titled CD.  The groups does a good job with the song, but Julie did it better, if only marginally.In the final analysis, \"The Reason Why\" is a solid album, well produced, engineered, and performed, but it draws more heavily from contemporary stimuli than the quartets' previous offerings.  And the lush vocal performances have always been the calling card of Little Big Town; \"The Reason Why\" proves that no other group has greater skill in arranging vocal harmonies than these four citizens of the South, be they C&W, Pop, or Rock.  That being said I want my old Little Big Town back!\n", "val": 0.0003232629387639463}

{"text": "I've been following Little Big Town since the release of \"THE ROAD TO HERE\" and have been an ardent fan since. Their approach to folkish, rootsy music is a breath of fresh air. Their music is honest and down-to-earth; there is no artificial flamboyance to this band. That all 4 are lead vocalists in this band adds to the wonder. And of course, when all four sing together, Little Big Town becomes a classic example of the sum of parts being infinitely greater than the individual components.\"THE REASON WHY\" continues to retain all of the elements that make Little Big Town so special, plus a little bit more of the major studio magic (given that this is the first official release from a major recording label by the band - all their previous releases were independent).So, what's different?1. The songs have more oomph. \"THE ROAD TO HERE\" and \"A PLACE TO LAND\" had great songs, but those songs lacked development and taking it a further step to brilliance. Current bands that do this well - U2, Coldplay. Now include Little Big Town. \"Shut Up Train\" is a good example, on the 2 aforementioned albums, the song would likely have ended at 3:00. Instead, it gets a 45-second extension that makes it so much more memorable and emotional. \"Kiss Goodbye\" is tellingly going to be a crowd favourite, imagine the sheer epic-ness of the chorus and the song that just continues to build to the magnificent climax. I can already hear them perform this live. The opening track, \"The Reason Why\" is explosive as an album opener.2. Singing is styled to fit the mood of the song. The Western grit is clearly evident in the opening lines and excellent note-holding in \"Runaway Train\", a stomp your feet on the ground country rocker. \"Yeah, I sold my guitar for a diamond riiiinnnnggggg...\"... how can you not just sing along? \"Why, Oh Why\" has predictable harmonies in its opening line \"why, oh why...\" but takes those harmonies one step further in the second line \"lies, your lies...\". What a delightful surprise.3. Little Big Town's true nature and characteristics that set them apart from any other country bands is given stronger emphasis. How? \"Little White Church\" is \"Boondocks\" #2 but given an additional boost and dosage of boots, cowboy hat and dirt.On top of all that, you still get the Little Big Town you've loved so much. Here's why:1. Despite the talked-up major studio touch, Little Big Town has retained its identity. \"THE REASON WHY\" is distinctively Little Big Town.2. I love Little Big Town ballads. Guess what - their here! \"Rain On A Tin Roof\" is an upscale \"Bring It On Home\". \"Lean Into It\" is an improved and tastefully arranged version of \"Stay\". \"You Can't Have Everything\" is a quiet, thoughtful one that reflects the lyrics superbly. It is also delivered with tremendous conviction.3. The voices shine as brightly as ever. More than on any other prior Little Big Town release, all 4 vocalists get to carry songs on their own.So, here's \"THE REASON WHY\" you should pick this one up. Then again, not that you needed any.Liam F26 September 2010\n", "val": 0.01922849752008915}

I don't care if their last CD was a flop It had a song dear to my heart called \"Only What You Make Of It\". The song was comforting to me. OK, Let's get on with reviewing \"The Reason Why\" CD, Let's talk about the songs on it:1. \"The Reason Why\" One of the tracks I heard at the Throwdown Tour. Karen and Jimi do this song as a duet(something Charles and Hillary of Lady A would do). It's also 1 of my fave tracks on the CD!2. \"Runaway Train\" No, this is not the cover of the Soul Asylum hit, Jimi wrote this himself. The song does sound like a train going fast. Another 1 I heard on the Throwdown Tour. Like this 1 too.3. \"Kiss Goodbye\" A song co-written by Hillary Lindsey (Who wrote for Carrie Underwood and Martina McBride among others). Phillip sings lead and plays piano on it. The harmonies for this song sound like it would've been on Little Big Town's first CD.4. \"Shut Up Train\" Another song co-written by Hillary Lindsey. Karen's voice is totally beautiful on this and the harmonies too. I kinda don't get this song. Is Karen telling a train to shut up?5. \"Why Oh Why\" Little Big Town opens their sets with this song at the moment. It was co-written by Jonathan Singleton. Kimberly's lead vocal really rocks on it!Did I mention they start the song a capella?6. \"Little White Church\" The first single off the CD about as big as \"Boondocks\"! It's a catchy song kinda copies \"Single Ladies\" by Beyonce. The hand claps go great with this song and Karen has a strong vocal on this one too. I can't even get this tune out of my head!!7. \"You Can't Have Everything\" Kimberly's voice and LBT's harmonies are gorgeous on this one! Kinda sad It's about losing certain somethings.8. \"All The Way Down\" This one with Karen on lead vocals, is really catchy as well. The beginning sounds like a old record sound, and you might not get the chorus out of your head anytime soon.9.\"All Over Again\" Phillip sings lead on this and it sounds like it would be an Adult Contemporary hit. Not a bad song.10. \"Rain On A Tin Roof\" Julie Roberts performed this song before, but Jimi sings lead on this on the CD. You can learn more about this on the web.11. \"Life Rolls On\" Jimi once again sings lead on this song as well. The la la part is fun to sing along with, and It might help you feel better.12. \"Lean Into It\" I learned that the song was written when Wayne Kirkpatrick remembered the times the group went through, the good and the bad, also a song for people who go through hard times as well.Trust me you will love this CD! take a listen to the samples, and download it or buy it! Thanks for reading! Have a Little Big Day!\n", "val": 0.003894644323736429}
{"text": "As opposed to some of the critics on this site, I loved this album... but was disappointed with their last album.  Not that the songs on the last album were all that bad, but I knew it wasn't going to be air playable.  Like it or not if you can't get a song on the radio the album won't sell.  If the the album doesn't sell, the artist disappears as well.  This group is too good to fade into the sunset.  The new album is a better balance of themes and sound that will hopefully appease the diehard fan and new listener.  Sure... \"Shut up Train\" and \"Lean into It\" are among my favorites... but the mainstream sound of \"Little White Church\" and \"The Reason Why\" will keep this train rolling for some time.\n", "val": 0.004909951705485582}
{"text": "First, I have to say that I absolutely loved \"A Place to Land\".  It's one of my favorite albums of the past 5 years.  Unfortunately, for me, \"The Reason Why\" does not even get close to the level that Little Big Town reached on their previous album.  For me, none of the songs have the poignancy that they exhibited on earlier albums.  The best of the lot in my opinion are \"You Can't Have Everything\" (which really spotlights the harmonies that I love so much), \"All Over Again\", and \"Life Rolls On\".  While it's not a bad album by any stretch, their previous work has set the bar very high for me and this album just didn't get there.\n", "val": 0.0004898399347439408}
{"text": "I have just listened to the new Little Big Town album all the way through and have to say I am sorely disappointed.I have \"The Road to Here\" and \"A Place to Land\" and have always loved them. LBT have always been a cut above other country groups with their wonderful four part harmonies and sly sense of humour (as in \"Welcome to the Family\" and \"Wounded\").It saddens me to say that this album sounds nothing like the Little Big Town I know. Gone are the catchy up-beat tunes that endeared me to them the first time round. Gone are the heart breaking melodies. People seem to be talking about \"Little White Church\" with affection but compared other previous songs it is pretty dull.In fact the whole album is just that - dull. It sounds like the most average plodding middle of the road country album you've ever heard. There seems to be no passion or enthusiasm, they sound quite bored when performing to be honest. There is no zing or life like there used to be. Even the slower more thoughtful songs lack that heartfelt quality that made previous tracks like \"Live with Lonesome\" so poignant.I don't what has happened - maybe it's the old story of studio execs coming in and trying to make them more commercial and in doing so have stripped away all the individuality that made them so great in the first place. I'm afraid my copy is going straight on ebay. I was so looking forward to this album!\n", "val": 8.160352444974706e-05}
{"text": "As anyone whos been following the music of Little Big Town since 1998 should know, this is one of those rare country bands whose lineup has never changed, and who incorporate sounds of old-time Americana in their work to such an extent that you could easily mistake their recordings for something circa 1986. Of course, this may or may not be a good thing depending upon their target audience, but things have definitely improved on \"The Reason Why\", which is on their fourth label (hopefully they stick to this one for a while), and noticeably their most slickly produced work to date.Listen, theres a wide country audience out there that gives equal credit to the likes of George Strait, Brad Paisley & Miranda Lambert, and honestly, Little Big Town is neither better nor worse than those acts. What they do have in spades, perhaps even more than Rascal Flatts & Montgomery Gentry do, is some great harmonizing. Comprised of Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman, Jimi Westbrook, and Phillip Sweet, the equal amount of time given to each singer is commendable, considering that on bands such as Lady Antebellum, or even The Zac Brown Band, there is always one vocalist who hogs the limelight. Not so on this recording.Lead single \"Little White Church\" is ironically the weakest cut here. I was supposed to review this album for a country digest that commissioned it, and spent about two days with my promo copy, post which it became clear that this was a keeper. Not in the sense that \"Revolution\" by Lambert or even \"Whoevers in New England\" by Reba McEntire were keepers, but the harmonizing here is excellent, and brought to mind The Roches, in places.For a fourth album, this hits all the right notes. On a scale of modern country music and its effect on the general public, its ironic that music that I do not consider country by any means (\"Fearless\" by Taylor Swift, for instance), should outsell more rootsy records such as these. While Little Big Town would need more than just this album to hit the big time, this is a great pit stop on their road to further stardom. Sadly, with the likes of Jaron & The Long Road, or even Chuck Wicks clogging up country radio, its hard to imagine that true artistry such as the one displayed on the title track here would get the recognition it so rightly deserves.Four Stars. A worthy addition to the LBT catalog.\n", "val": 0.00957146380096674}
{"text": "After I first heard \"Boondocks\" by Little Big Town I was hooked. Loved the \"Road To Here\" album, but didn't feel that it's follow up, \"A Place To Land\" lived up to \"Road\". Well now with \"The Reason Why\" LBT has released what could be their best album yet. The album has a great set of songs with nothing that would be considered \"filler\". I love the whole album, but the stand out tracks are: \"The Reason Why\" (this will stick in your head for days), \"Runaway Train\", \"Shut Up Train\" (love the images conveyed in this track), \"Little White Church\" (great video and this has got to be a favorite in concert), \"You Can't Have Everything\" (hard core country, sounds a LOT like a Pam Tillis outtake), \"All The Way Down\" (another one that must be great in concert), \"Lean Into It\" (pristine harmony on this one). These for me are the best of the best, the whole album is very strong. This is one of those albums, that you will find yourself starting all over again once it ends. I played it three times back to back the other day!! Little Big Town is one the best country groups out there right now, and this album is \"The Reason Why\"!! (bad pun I know, but it works!)\n", "val": 0.02710871770977974}

{"text": "Those familiar with the show and these songs will know that Phineas and Ferb as well as other characters have \"speaking parts\" before, during and after most of the songs. The songs are still good, but be aware that all of these sound bytes are edited out on the versions of the songs found here. For example:Phineas and Ferb are not heard comenting and complimenting each other on their choice of \"stunt singers\" in Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan. Likewise, Chaka does not ask \"Where's Perry?\" at the end of \"I Believe We Can\".We don't hear Ferb ask, \"So, what do you do here again?\" At the end of \"Rubber Bands Rubber Balls\".That's just a couple of examples - there are others. To me, those two examples to me are hilarious parts of those two songs that I was disappointed to find edited out.For whatever reason it's a common thing with soundtracks from TV shows (and often movies). I'm no entertainment lawyer, but my bet is it has something to do with singing credits and voice credits. If they include these \"speaking parts\", money has to get paid to the voice talents.

{"text": "A little about my music preferences: I am mainly 80's music person  but listen to  pop contemporary billboard songs.  I find myself drawn mainly upbeat catchy songs. Also, it takes alot for me to really like a song nowadays and put it on my permanent itunes list.  That saying, I am not really a hip-hop listener...the only hip-hop i own on my itunes are from early 2000 which includes Houston and Nelly....My take on Nelly:  I find Nelly's songs so catchy and unique sounding.  I like how he blends different tempos/voices together at the same time making his songs really different compared to alot of artists out there.  Crazy as this sounds, i wondered what happened Nelly in the past year or so...and gosh, was I so glad to find out he sang in the Manny Pacquaio-Antonio Margarito fight.  He sang 2 of his classics and this particular song...so i had to hear it.  Yes, so classic Nelly in tune, and am so happy he hasn't changed after these yrs!My take on this song:  Clean song.  Upbeat subdued tempo but not club-dancing tune.  The song is about regret.  He sings that lost a lover, and admits it was his fault...something rare in the genre of love songs out there.  You do sense this 'sad' undertone as Nelly repeats the chorus again and again (which is marvelous to sing to BTW).  I really think this is his most 'sensitive' ballad song...very beautiful in tune and lyrics.  The sample in Amazon is a very good sample.Nelly, i looove this song. welcome back!

When I gave the songs a listen that were available to preview before Monument was released, I was extremely impressed. I was not let down by this album, actually ecstatic that there wasn't a bad/mediocre song on it. Very brutal, very good. These guys are like the east coast's version of As I Lay Dying and they have a new fan in me. Outstanding album.\n", "val": 0.04774239659309387}
{"text": "I do understand the negativity that is directed towards this album.  If you have heard \"Apologies Are For the Weak\", the sound on \"Monument\" isn't much different.  However, I cannot relate; \"Monument\" is beautifully brutal.  This album, in no way, is mainstream.  With the exception of one song, the entire album is relentless.  The songs do not sound the same as the first album, but...  you could play the two CDs back to back and feel as though they are on the same album.  What this album could have used is more explosive breakdowns with guitar solos overlaying them and longer, epic songs.  I would love to hear an eight minute song from this band.  Whatever the case, this album is thoroughly enjoyable and deserves more than one listen.\n", "val": 0.009525763802230358}

{"text": "It's fairly easy to tell if you'll like this album. If you loved their first album, there's a very good chance you'll like this one. If you thought their first album was just OK, there's a good chance you'll either feel the same way about this album, or you won't like it at all. And if you hated their first album, you will hate this album.Where do I fall? I didn't think their first album was all that great. Very generic, predictable breakdown-laden metalcore that climaxes with a clean, sing-song chorus in almost every track. Deviating from this formula would allow them to explore the areas of their music in which they were strong. The band isn't short on actual talent, but in terms of songwriting they are sadly tied to the constraints of the style of music they play.Being a metalcore/deathcore or whatevercore band doesn't mean you have to follow the leader. Bands that progress and take their music in other directions are the ones that will survive in the long run.In any case, Miss May I's sophomore release takes their music in the direction their debut set forth. Is it basically Apologies are For the Weak part 2? You could say that, though they do sound a little bit heavier. There is nothing on this album that is particularly surprising and you know what you're getting when you buy this album. It's not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but they deliver what they advertise.What does this band do well? They're not short on aggression and they do have a good grasp of tempo and rhythm. All of that is evident. I only wish they would've taken the effort to push those limits and transcend the need for untimely breakdowns and auto tune-esque clean singing. Unfortunately I don't really see the desire to deviate from metalcore from these guys.So, if you're looking for that AAFTW sequel, pick it up. If you're looking for more progression like I was, then you might want to skip out on this one. You're not getting anything you didn't get with their debut.\n", "val": 0.00040241735405288637}
{"text": "First i want to start off saying I Love Miss May I. Ever since their first album AAFTW i couldn't stop listening, i finally found a band that is unique and awesome! That saying, i had HIGH hopes and anticipation for their next album, but if i knew this was going to be how it sounded i would have probably lowered my expectations. While this album isn't bad, it's a big step, but in the wrong direction. The songs all sound alike, not counting the ballad \"In Recognition\" which imo was cool because it was different, but it was terrible! The album starts off heavy with the track \"Our Kings\" speeding down your ear drums, but then after that it's all downhill until the final track \"Monument\" which FINALLY brings us back to the band we know as Miss May I. For a very talented band that had a bursting debut, this album really let me down. It's repetitive and having only been out for a week i'm already bored of it. Miss May I has officially gone Mainstream with this album and it really shows. Now don't get me wrong, i'm still going to listen to AAFTW while waiting for their NEXT album, because they still show promise, even though this album was a stinker.\n", "val": 0.0001614089560462162}

{"text": "I've only been listening to Miss May I for a few months. I have known about them since they came out with their first album, but haven't really gotten around to actually listening to them. After being legitimately satisfied with the band's material, I heard from a couple of my friends that they were coming to play in Seattle in about two weeks. They said that they had bought me a ticket because one of them was having his birthday there, so I decided I would go since this band was pretty good, and I had seen both opening acts before and liked one of them. Overall I was satisfied with Miss May I's performance, not something I would spend my own money on but I had fun. I had only heard their first album before that so I bought their new CD since I liked the songs that they played off of it.First off I would like to say that Miss May I is one of the heaviest metalcore bands I've ever heard in my life. They aren't quite as thrashy and ear suffocating as Mnemic (the heaviest metalcore band I know of), but their breakdowns are so brutal I think my heart skipped a beat during one of them. I would like to note something that I think was a horrible decision. And that is that they chose one of the worst screamers to be a guest vocalist on one of the songs. I mean, he is horrible, and if you want to know just how bad he is, read my review on Attack Attack's self-titled album, and message me and I'll send you two YouTube links that I will have you watch. My favorite thing about the overall sound of the album is that there is tons of clean, meaty bass that sounds awesome. The bass blasts are perfect, without distortion. In Miss May I's first album, the vocalist really needed some improvements due to an undeveloped and unpracticed scream and growl. But in this album, damn, his vocals sound astonishing. His vocal frys are perfect and his growls are deep and full. The singing can be a bit out of tune sometimes, so maybe the singer should practice more and remember to take care of his throat and such. One thing that I recently realized is that this band is one of the only screamo/metalcore bands that get regular air time (I don't know about the rest of the world but they sure get played on one of my stations quite a bit), even though there are tons more other bands like that that never get played on the radio, which is something that I've always wondered (which probably why the concert had tons of people there). An improvement that I would make is that most of the breakdowns in the album sound very similar to each other, which shows lack in creativity. I think that the best musician in the band is most definitely their drummer! The drummer uses a larger than usual set and (unlike most drummers that use huge sets) he actually uses it and knows how to use it well! That and the singing are the main downsides to this album.The first song is one of their faster songs, and the band really nails keeping on time which makes the song really cool. The song starts out with pure speed and brutality, and then makes a very smooth transition to a melodic, sung chorus with an excellent transition back in to the speed and anger. The second song is my favorite, despite the fact that it features one of my most hated and unsupported vocalists. The song is very fast a lot of the times, and then has a whole mish-mosh of melodic parts, brutal breakdowns, and other unexpected stuff. This song is really where the drummer shows everyone what he is capable of, huge thumbs up for the fancy drumming! Now the breakdown at the end is one of the most brutal breakdowns I've ever heard a melodic band play, when I heard it, I couldn't stop smiling and laughing because it really gave the song an astonishingly fantastical ending. The pure anger and rage in the whole album is so controlled and beautifully expressed. This album definitely gets a solid 19/20. This album would mainly impress people who are fans of melodic death, metalcore, and screamo. I will most likely buy their new album.\n", "val": 0.005905023775994778}

{"text": "There are just so few singers that today have been timeless because of the sophistication of the voice alone. Hard to believe that so many of them from Soul & R&B music have passed on too young. Unfortunately, it has been over a decade since Luther Vandross tragically passed away, and so far no one has been able to really shine based on the sophistication of the voice alone. There has never been a soulful singer from today's music that has not even been able to scratch the surface from the soulful voice Luther Vandross left behind when he passed away from complications of a severe stroke he suffered in 2005. One of Luther's last songs Dance With My Father is definitely a brilliant classic that still shows a whole lot of heart for a father whom passed on when a child is too young, and all he prays like his mom is to see the light from his deceased parent's eyes again. It is just one of those deep songs I will always think of Luther Vandross for, because Luther really gave his heart on this song. If you have never even heard a Luther Vandross song before, this is sincerely one to recommend going to.Song: B+\n", "val": 0.010146449320018291}

{"text": "Hard to believe that it has nearly been a decade since the world lost one of the nicest soul singers, Luther Vandross. Yet, his body of work definitely belongs in the rankings of the great soul singers like Marvin Gaye, Barry White and Diana Ross. But what Luther was able to showcase, was a defiance in simplicity at writing songs, but also complimenting others by doing great renditions of their work as well. But one his last songs, Dance With My Father showed an absolute beautiful sense of loss, losing his dad very early on in life, but loving the memory of his father with him. The song is definitely a beautiful and soulful song that remains a gem to listen too. It is never possible to celebrate Luther's life and career, without mourning his loss.

Now, Paramore is OK, but I wish they focused more on the pop and less on the angst.  Cassadee Pope and her boys are more my kind of band.  Kind of like a current incarnation of Letters To Cleo...which makes sense as HM parted ways with their drummer, and all drum duties are by one Stacy Jones...the current leader of Boston powerpoppers American Hi-Fi...he was the drummer for Letters To Cleo then Veruca Salt...he's like a cooler Dave Grohl...drummer of Nirvana-turned-bandleader of the Foo Fighters.Anyhoo, this new RELEASE (I cannot call it an album, sorry, as it's only 6 new songs) is a fantastic and fast followup to their full-length Columbia debut \"Hold On Tight\", which came out the tail-end of 2008 with the cool powerpop classic singles \"Homecoming\" and \"How You Love Me Now\" (co-written with powerpop genius Butch Walker)...all 6 songs on \"Beneath It All\" are superb and I wonder if there will be maybe another EP in 6 months??  That would be cool, and in this day & age, more acts are releasing a string of EPs in a calendar year rather than 1 full album once every 2-3 years...not only Hey Monday, but also cool punky Swedish dancepop queen Robyn's \"Body Talk\" EPs and country rocker Blake Shelton with his \"Six-Pack\" series.  Hey, I'll take 3 Hey Monday EPs with tunes this good!!!  Cassadee has the perfect girlpop voice, the band rocks with cool riffs, they have tunes up the wazzoo with heavenly hooks, harmonies to die for, the works...and Cassee is really a good songwriter...I think she's just getting started.Tracks #1 + 2, \"Wish You Were Here\" & \"Wondergirl\" are my favorite tunes here...but the Butch-produced, played-on and co-written \"Hangover\" is almost as worthy.  I would keep an eye on Cassadee's progress as a songwriter...she's got the goods...a kickass mix of great melody, hooks, soul and deep lyrical honesty...she wears her heart on her sleeve even if it bleeds.  On \"Hold On Tight\", 2 songs that really showed this mix well were \"Candles\" and \"Hurricane Streets\", which came from experience, as they are from West Palm Beach, Florida, and get hit with hurricanes on a regular basis.Hey Monday, one of the best bands out today and this new EP is great and inexpensive...BUY it.\n", "val": 0.019577573984861374}

Then continuing the balance of soothing your soul, using carefully selected sounds is presented in the following 3 tracks of the album. Afterward came 'South Wind' which will literally blow away your problems; 'Circle Pray' with the haunting voices will put you in the journey to another dimension, while 'Requiem' (one of my favorites) will remind you of your lost love, desires, creating an atmosphere of lust, compassion and will definetlly give you goosebumps and something to wonder about after the track slowly finishes. And in the end there is the upbeat 'Ritual Winds' with the amazingly displayed rhythm and beautifully played electric violin, which will let you think about the most exotic and most treasured places you have been to, or you have seen.All in all, this is excellent Kitaro release, and highly recommended both to the old Kitaro fans, and also to the newcomers of this genre.\n", "val": 0.032691553235054016}

{"text": "When I first heard FOX was doing a remake of the immortal cult classic, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" I couldn't help but groan and roll my eyes.  In this age of remakes, this gem should not be touched, I thought.  And then they said it was going to be made-for-TV and going to be aired on FOX.  I just about lost faith in the project all together-- there's no way the censors would allow even half the stuff in the show to be done on public television.But then, director Kenny Ortega made something abundantly clear in the interviews about the project.  \"It's not a remake.  We're not doing the movie again.  We're paying tribute to the movie and its legacy.\"  And this got me mildly interested in the project again.  At least, interested enough to check it out.So, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's do the Time Warp Again\" aired and received almost universally negative reviews.  To make a long story short, I didn't hate this as much everyone else seems to (I'm using words like \"almost\" and \"seems\" because there were people who liked it).  My opinion was more mixed; I thought it was very hit and miss.One of the production's strengths, in my own personal opinion, was the soundtrack.  These are the songs we all know and love.  \"The Time Warp,\"  \"Science Fiction Double Feature,\" \"Sweet Transvestite,\" and so on.  I really liked the way the songs were performed.  Initially, I thought some of the orchestrations or performances...odd (and by Rocky Horror standards, that's saying something).  But on repeated listenings, they started to grow on me.  And like I said in the title, if you don't compare them to the original, they are really good on their own merits.So while I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, and I won't be buying the DVD, I did enjoy the soundtrack and the songs and will definitely be adding the soundtrack to my collection.\n", "val": 0.0038299383595585823}

The fact of the matter is, anyone with any type of reasoning can take any piece of information and create several different conspiracy theories from the same information.  Listening to Jon Schaffer's interviews for this project, acting like hes on some holy crusade because he has all the information, is just silly.While I do think the world is messed up and Jon makes some excellent points (especially about people's apathy) on the other hand he goes off on this weird tangent.  The dude is just a metal musician with his own opinion, he has no information beyond what you can read on the internet.  The idea that he wants to great some grand movement with this thing is ridiculous and corny and comes off like some random 15 year old planning world domination.The only reason this gets any attention for it's message is because the guy is somewhat famous.  The links he has on his website are laughable.  Anything with Loose Change credited is just asking to be laughed away and forgotten.  This link here just sums everything up when it comes to conspiracy theories and all that Alex Jones nonsense.  [...]Thinking for yourself, ignoring the media, combating apathy are all great messages and that's what he should of been preaching with this project, instead we get Jon Schaffer telling YOU how HE wants you to think.If you can ignore the cheesy lyrics, the music is very well written and the vocals are very well done.

Since the hiring of a new tenor and replacing Melton at baritone, the Inspirations have bounced back and are still the best Southern Gospel has to offer.

The album has a good amount of diversity as in grabbing all genres of Black Music.  The title speaks for itself.

For me, once u get older and wiser, yes, your music is only gonna be played on certain stations.  This garbage that keeps coming out now gives me a lot of respect for this dude when he throws somthing out.  I was really impressed with his 1st single \"What we do here\" because I love Fender Rhodes and that's how the song starts. I love the Jazzy/r&b joints on here.  The best joint on here is \"Stay.\" \"Your song\" is definitely right behind it.  Really sincere.  I don't understand how know one likes \"Here With You.\" That song is classic!!! Great slow dancing song with ur wifey at home. The only problems i had with this cd is the songs with rappers on there and the songs with the Neo Soul type style.  There are some songs i think he can do that with, but he has to come with better snares, keep his formula of Fenders and play with the key signatures more (like Musiq did on \"Where are you Going\"), and more of a Stevie approach instead of Marvin Gaye.  I definitely can't stnd when he tries to sound like Marvin Gaye.  Only R.Kelly can get away with that.  I also think some songs could've have been longer (definitely \"Stay\")  Everything i do was perfect length and a beautiful song.  Thats the kind of music I miss.

{"text": "I heard from a few people that Brian McKnight's latest album Gemini is his best album in a while, so I checked it out and now I'm wondering why I was misled. Brian was doing fine with his first two albums (his self-titled album and I Remember You), but then came Anytime, which, despite its success, was one of those albums that made you say, \"Well, at least he's releasing the right songs.\" While he did get his groove back and then some with Back At One, his following two albums (Superhero and U-Turn) were weak. And this album isn't much different.It's not that Brian can't sing any more; it's just that there are too many missteps that can't be ignored. Things do start off with a bang, though, with \"What We Do Here\" and \"Everytime You Go Away\". But then comes the embarrassing \"Grown Man Business\", which makes it obvious that Brian still hasn't learned that trying to cater to the young crowd has never worked for him (ever hear the original version of \"Hold Me\" off Anytime?).Things also fail when guest rappers come aboard. I have no idea what Talib Kweli is doing on this album, but he kicks a lame verse on an already corny \"She\". But even worse than that is when Akon, Juvenile, Skip and some unknown femcee help Brian deliver the 106 & Park-ready \"Whatcha Gonna Do\". Brian still struggles by himself, though, especially with lyrics like \"I reach around and grab a little booty/And it feels so good\" (from \"Here With You\"). \"All Over Now\" is another young crowd pleaser gone wrong.While the album comes to a remarkable close with \"Your Song\" and \"Me & You\", this album really show's Brian's vocal skills and not much else. At this point, I'd only suggest you buy Gemini to complete your Brian McKnight collection.Anthony Rupert\n", "val": 6.243395910132676e-05}
{"text": "Brian McKnight was one of the most-prominent male, R&B artists to emerge in the 90s. His sales and success continued to increase towards the end of that decade and culminated with the multi-platinum success of his 1997 Anywhere CD and his 1999 Back to One CD. However, after that, his subsequent CDs, 2001 Superhero, 2003 U-Turn only went Gold and spawned hardly any singles success. Brian has matured and as a 37-year old singer, his audience seems to have matured causing him to only be played on Urban AC stations which really limits one to garner the commercial success that Brian experienced during the 90s. The music is also very mature.What We Do Here-Produced by Brian McKnight, this mid-tempo was a hit on Urban AC stations but very few people probably heard it. Brian sings about what goes on with a groupie or one-night stand should stay \"here\", nobody has to know. The song has a strong drum presence and sounds like standard Brian...nothing new or out of his element. I like the minor modulation in the bridge. A-Everytime you Go Away-Produced by Brian himself and containing one of my favorite instruments, strings. This longing, commiting ballad has Brian expressing his love for his lover in that the fact that every time he goes away him wanting to be around her. Brian's whiny, soft vocals fit this unconventional (at least in these times) conventional ballad very well. This was his second single which unfortunately experienced no success outside of the Urban AC venue. But this is the reason why I purchased the CD. It is an awesome ballad with a guitar interlude and some strong vocals towards the end. Brian really lets loose at the end which is something he rarely does. A+Grown Man Business-Produced by Poke and Tone, this mid-tempo with elements of \"Much too Much\" written by Marcus Miller sounds like one of those old-school cuts or at least something from the early 90s. The song really fits Brian well as he lays down \"grown man's business.\" A-Everything I Do-Produced by Brian McKnight, this song begins with an instrumental that makes it sound like it will be a ballad but once Brian starts in a Prince-like falsetto, the song turns into a soulful mid-tempo. Brian's range and vocal abilities are evidenced on this song as he sings about everything he does, he wants to be around his lover. It sounds like a compliment to Everytime you Go Away. Once again, some good vocals and a different arrangement, very mature. A-Here with you-Produced by Brian McKnight, this mid-tempo sounds old-school and to me, it is boring because it is hard for me to get into this kind of music. It sounds like something from his early 90s material. His vocals are good and the song is good, but it sounds dated. BAll Over Know-Produced by Brian McKnight and Don Curry, on this mid-tempo, more conventional song, Brian utilizes a different register of his vocals at certain points which makes the song different for him. However, the song does come off kind of boring and once again, it sounds like dated R&B. B+She-Produced by Carvin \"Ransom\" Haggins and Ivan \"Orthodox\" Barias, and featuring Talib Kweli, this mid-tempo is nothing new but has some of that Marvin Gaye feel to it in certain parts as it is dedicated to \"she\"/her. Brian sings the song well and the rap from Talib is good, but following some rather boring songs, it does not break the monotony. B+Stay-Produced by Brian McKnight, this jazzy song is boring. Nice vocals but once again it does not break the monotony. BCome Back to Me-Produced by Brian McKnight, this mid-tempo is dated and is boring. Does not break the monotony. BWhatcha Gonna Do?-Produced by Nikki Hollywood and featuring Juvenile and Skip, this new New Jack swing sounding cut finally breaks the monotony, samey sound of the songs before with an energetic opening rap from Juvenile. Probably one of the more commercial tracks on the CD. A-Your Song-Produced by Brian McKnight, although similar to the other cuts produced by Brian, this song does not have that boring, monotonous feel to it as much partly because it follows a different song but also because it has more life to it. But not a standout though. B+Me & You-Produced by Brian McKnight, this religious ballad is the obligatory religious ode that Brian includes on his CD and it is actually a very good song that speaks to the sacrifice that Jesus made for humanity. It makes me think that maybe Brian needs to do a Gospel CD because of all the songs, this one stands out the most. Very heartfelt. A+Overall, this CD almost seems like Brian's sophomore slump as he is in some kind of slump. Most of the songs are very dated, very jazzy which is ok if that is what he wants to sing, but if he is looking for radio to play his songs he needs to revert to other genres of music...not necessarily rap because Brian does not sound as natural, comfortable with guest raps but some well-crafted R&B songs. He should probably stop relying on himself and utilize some underground producers like Ivan Ransom and Carvin Haggins who have produced some dynamite material for Faith Evans, Musiq Soulschild and others. Maybe he should cut a Gospel CD as he has an inspirational-sounding voice. Or he could cut a neo-soul CD, but he needs to experiment and try something different or he is going to be totally forgotten about as a vocalist. He also needs to experiment vocally as he sounds the same as he always has. Try something new, Brian. I guess , with the Gemini, this CD is showing a side of Brian we have not really experienced before or since 1992 when he first came out.\n", "val": 0.003138933563604951}

Brian serenades me with his voice but in this effort I felt he'd \"already done it before.\"  Many of the tracks sounded as if he sampled his own work, laid some new vocals and slapped a new title on it and voila - a mishap.

{"text": "It is a shame that Brian McKnight has lost his fan-base from years ago.  This album truly isn't bad or uninspired by any means.  In fact, it is better than his last release, U TURN.  Brian McKnight has what I consider one of the best voices in R&B. What makes him interesting as a musician is the fact that he combines contemporary R&B with contemporary jazz. The downside of that combination is that sometimes McKnight comes over too contemporary or too urban.The main downside of GEMINI is the fact that Brian McKnight really doesn't try to alter his formula any. Unfortunately, that is one of the reasons that I think GEMINI has bombed on the Billboard Charts,which is said considering Brian McKnight deserves to be going platinum easily.  I think to regain his fan base, his next album will have to be a little different from U TURN or GEMINI, which are very solid albums.GEMINI has several good hits including \"What We Do Here\", \"Everyime You Go Away\" (my personal favorite), \"Grown Man Business\", and \"Here With You\".  Where Gemini loses credibility is when it grows too urban and the songs sound too much alike.  As an album, it's certainly not the album of the year for 2005-06, but it isn't bad by any means.  If you aren't into the dance-pop/club facet of R&B these days (Ciara, Nivea (via \"Okay\"), or Amerie), then this album is probably for you.  This album is in league with Kem; a mix of contemporary jazz & contemporary R&B.  3.5 stars.\n", "val": 0.007707712706178427}
{"text": "Brian McKnight seems to be like fine wine, he only gets better with time. Usually one can blame Brian McKnight for making albums which are often unworthy of his talent (generally his albums are a blend of great songs and filler), but that's not the case here : believe me, this album contains no filler, unlike most of today's R&B releases.According to me, he's one of the rare true Quiet Storm singers remaining today and also one of the greatest \"contemporary Motown\" artists.With his 8 albums, he has proven that he was here to stay.From the first seconds of this new album, you know that you won't be fooled. \"Stay With Him\" is a very beautiful gospel song. The following tracks, \"What We Do Here\" and \"Everytime You Go Away\" sound more like conventional contemporary R&B but are very nice too.The funky \"Grown Man Business\" is also largely enjoyable... like the title say, it's a grower.\"Your Song\" is jazzier : it's definitively a winner, with its smooth jazz irresistible backing. \"She\", which features Musiq and Talib Kweli, and the laidback \"neo-soul\"-ish \"Stay\" are pretty hard to dislike too. Along with the melancholic \"Me & You\" which beautifully ends the album, 2 other gems are the smooth \"Everything I Do\" and \"Here With You\". \"Here With You\" sounds like Bee Gee's \"Love You Inside Out\" (the verses follow exactly the same melody) meets Isley Brothers' \"For The Love of You\" but it is a magnificent track, which could be the album's finest moment.From start to finish, this album is just wonderful!

{"text": "Gemini demonstrates Brian's continuing growth as an already highly accomplished singer-songwriter. There's no denying that he is a superb singer - one of, if not, THE best contemporary r'n'b singers. The intro track of acappella singing instantly announces that Brian's vocals are going to take centre-stage on this set. Tracks such as 'Everytime you go away', 'What we do here', 'Come back' and the mellow, slightly lounge-like 'Your song' perfectly demonstrate his unique singing range. His excellent use of falsetto can be seen on 'Everything I do' and 'Here with you'. Guest appearances come from Talib Kweli on 'She' and from Akon and Juvenile on 'Whatcha gonna do?' and they add to, rather than detract from, the songs. As on previous releases, Brian includes a track that expresses his deep religious faith. On this album it is 'Me and You' and is truly sublime - my favourite track on the album. That said, not all tracks stand out. 'All over now' and 'Stay' are quite average - though listenable - but thankfully they don't in any way taint the album.

{"text": "Brian gets a 4 for DIVERSITY although the CD actually gets a 3.  This is, however, one of the first times I have heard the versatility of his voice. The first 2 songs are really traditional Brian, and once you get to #3 \"Everytime You Go\" you realize he's giving you something a little different than before...Grown Man Business....we'll skip this one....but #5 \"Everthing I Do\" is so GOOD, the \"purple dude\" is probably in awe, then #6 \"Here With You\" is a cross between El Debarge and the lead singer from AWB (if you know old school); amazingly \"Your Song\" sounds like Stevie or George Benson (the guitars make you lean more towards Benson) and \"Come Back\" reminds you of Marvin....What's interesting about this approach is none of the aforementioned artists can sound like one of the others or like Brian McKnight.  This guy's voice is SO OUTSTANDING...what a wonderful instrument!That said, he continues to try to cater to the \"masses\" which doesn't match his talents as they are far more superior than what is considered \"secular\", so I did not like the \"rap\" influenced jams at all.  Once he realizes that he is an R&B singer (and potentially jazz) and puts together a compilation with a \"real\" band and a different producer(sorry Brian)....the sky is the limit for him!!!I sure wish he would hurry up!\n", "val": 0.004684581886976957}
{"text": "Just like many artist, Brian has grown into his music.  Since the past couple of cd's he as made several transformations.  First he was more the surrogate father, bellowing out sappy love songs for couples, then after the divorce he went through a slight thug faze, which did not fit and now he has found his niche as one of R&B premiere crooners, rivaling such artist as Gerald Levert and the likes.\"What We Do Here\" the first single has gotten tremendous airplay and will be an R&B staple\"Every time You Go Away\" reminds me of Jagged Edges' \"Lets Get Married\" and seems to have the same harmony, yet it is a stand out on the cd.\"Grown Man Business\" is a nice mid-tempo jam and sure to be a single.\"Everything I Do\" could easily be a Prince/Maxwell cut.  Brian does a good job at maintaining a falsetto sound without being cartoonish or vocally challenged.  and will probably be released as a single.\"Here with You\" is a mid tempo cut with great vocal range.  It is actually one of my fav on the cd.\"All Over Now\" hits close to an urban sound.  But sounds more like a filler.\"She\" is one the few up-tempo cuts, but a step down from a dance track.  I think McKnight it at his best at ballads. One of the two cuts featuring rappers and this one includes Talib Kweli, an artist I had never heard of until now.\"Come Back\" this track grew on me. Listen closely and you can hear Brian with a Marvin Gaye sound which is very impressive considering Gaye's impact and contribution to the music industry and a comparison of the two saids alot.  Got a sorta \"Lets get it on\" feel.\"Whatcha Gonna Do?\" - features Juvenile and the 2nd cut to include a rapper and Mc.'s attempt to stay mainstream. A comfortable cut after a few listens.\"Your Song\" makes you wonder whom McKnight is singing to...could it be his ex-wife or a past love.  The lyrics deal with his decision to write and dedicate song to the one he loves. On this particular track I hear a hint of Stevie.  But maybe it is just me.\"Me and You\" the one and only gospel cut seems to be a personal testimony to Mc's relationship with his God.  It is nice for those moments of reflection of the love of Christ. Also one of my favorite.I find that Brian has found niche on this cd.  He is romantic without being overt and filthy.  The lyrics are for the mature and those who can appreciate grown folks grime.  He has added a little rap flava to keep the cd balanced and has even included a gospel track on the end.  Besides being one of the finest brutha to grace a cd cover and a finer chocolate' in person, he has great style and music selection.  His voice is versatile and not at all one-dimensional.  I highly recommend spending a night with this cd. Even though this cd is not a masterpiece, it is worth the small amount of cash.\n", "val": 0.013135239481925964}

{"text": "This year of 2005 is very young, a couple of months, but this is one of best I've heard of the new music of the new year! Brian McKnight really tops himself with Gemini.  This album focuses on a live sound and it shows on many songs.  Everything I Do (with its similar Bryan Adams song title in the chorus) is the best song here, as Brian shows that falsetto a lot on this song! A couple of the songs, he sounds eerily close to Marvin Gaye.  Because Brian is so true to his music, writing and producing his own songs, this album is one of his best.  I like his hip-hop driven songs with Talib Kweli, Juvenile and others, and he has his own heavy beats on those songs! Brian does his own Dr. Dre thing on these few songs! The final number is dramatic and very timely for the Lent season of some religions. Brian's song about Jesus on this final song is moving and emotional.  This album just shows Brian McKnight at the top of his music game. I hope this album has a lot of hits soon!\n", "val": 0.07508215308189392}

I would put him up there with the other great artists in Motown history like Smokey Robinson and Lionel Ritchie (Both of them who wrote, composed and sang there own music).

You have once again allowed us within the soul of you and only a true fan will know that Gemini is the very soul of you.  I am ever so glad that you are placed with in new skin.  I commend and respect you even more for the inside view of what the world doesn't allow us to see.  The Rawness, The Humor, The Cries, The Lovemaking, The Peace that illuminates from this album.  It's instruments that takes you away and the words just leaves you speechless and you just find yourself wanting to know.  What's it like to be that in Love, In addition a stepping stones to endure human nature and be accountable for our actions as adults.  It's not just an album it's his Love Letter to his ex wife and all of the women he ever encountered and missunderstood his intentions.  He implements and masters the hardship and struggles as well as Love of a Real Man.  Giving better understanding in knowing that he too is Human.  I have been a fan since his Self titled Album 10+ years.  For all the new comers.  You have got to start from the beginning to Accept and Appreciate \"Gemini\".  Everything else has been so watered down that real music with emotions and sustainance has been lost.  But B You brought it back.

I wrote it on my calendar and was in the store to get it right away.  I put it in my car cd player and prepared myself for the best yet.  Unfortunately, I did not get what I was so looking forward to.This album is lost.  It has no focus, swinging from one side to the other for meaning and depth.  At times, it is almost tuneless.  For one of the greatest talents of our time, it is most certainly NOT one of his best efforts.  But I also think it is really representative of what he is going through in his personal life right now.  He is lost, he cannot find the meaning, he himself is tuneless and colorless right now.After listening to the album, I felt sad for him, and I sincerely hope he works through his own personal grief.  Embracing his saddest and angriest feelings would produce much better music than this attempt that feels like he's trying too hard during a time in his life that he just cannot make music.The only song that had any soul or meaning to it that sounded like the BMcK of old is the last one on the album.  He still believes strongly in his faith and can sing with conviction about it.  That excited me and gave me hope that he will pull through this depressive time.\n", "val": 5.655201312038116e-05}

I heard \"What we do Here\" the first time on the Wayne Brady Show, that was taken off the Air in May of 2004. Moving on....I loved the feel of this album, Brian produced most of the tracks and it gives the album a great flow. The whole time I felt like I was in a small R&B nightclub.Brian's Singing only seems to get better. When a man can do everypart of a 4-part harmony like he did on \"Stay with Him\", he is just talented. His sound is infectious and different then anyone else out there, a big reason he is one of my favorite artists.What happens to this album I didn't see coming. His lyrics feel like they don't have the soul they once and always did. You can't feel there is any meaning behind his words, maybe because he's not married, but somethings missing. He dosen't have any sad ballads on the album either. I miss the feelings he had on all his albums. From \"Never felt like this\" to \"One Last Cry\", \"6,8,12\", \"Still\", \"Anytime\" and \"Kiss you love Goodbye\", the feeling of his words to all this and more was what drew to the songs, everything else fell into place.He needs to find what worked for him before, and put it back in his life.Saying all this, I'm still going to listen to this album over and over again, see if I can find the soul I think is missing, but \"Everytime you go Away\" is one the best songs of his career, especially his best producing.\n", "val": 0.013398129492998123}

I sense that he feels like he needs to get back to \"his roots\" by going more soulful, more slow hip-hoppy.  And while he succeeds on those points, it's just not gonna produce a top 10 single on regular top 40 radio.

{"text": "Recent commericals advertising Brian Mcknight's latest cd, Gemini, aren't even fair. They don't even come close to what Brian exhibits on his latest gift. Who thought of that campy crap anyway? This cd is complex, sophisticated and mature.  Songs such as WWDH (What We Do Here) , Everytime You Go Away, and Everything I Do stay true to Brian's creative insight on relationships and dating with a background of great melodies to support it. In addition, there's always a tune that reinforces that despite his status as a hot R and B Balladeer, he still has religion.  Me and You is a solid conclusion to an already great album.  I should also mention that he does have a couple of  guest artists on this cd but it's not overwhelming to hear them over already great lyrics and music arrangements. In other words, they don't get in the way of what Brian is attempting to accomplish.While other artist might sell their souls to get chart toppers, Mcknight stays dedicated to what traditional R and B fans like -- seductive lyrics and arrangements that are delivered just in time for Valentine's Day 2005.  This one is better than Superhero and a bit more complex than U-Turn.  It leaves you wondering how much of his material is art imitating life? Makes you wonder.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. I just LOVE this album. From the stunning, stunning ballad \"Green\" which sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it, and the beautiful \"Bondage of Fate\" to tracks like \"Pulse\" (the adult nature of which, I have to admit, was a bit of a shock at first!) with its infectious beat.  I've been a fan of OMD for over 30 years and I've always loved their instrumentation, and this is no exception, it's superb. I absolutely love every track and just can't decide which one is my favourite. This is OMD doing what they do best, they've gone back to their electronic roots instead of trying to be mainstream. I've only got one tiny, tiny gripe and that's that Paul doesn't do any of the lead vocals at all. But still, this album is BRILLIANT.

{"text": "...don't judge on just the first taste.On first listen, History of Modern may sound a little strange and disorienting, but after repeated listens it really sets in and is a great album.We start with a euro-pop, sing-songy opening track: New Babies; New Toys. Then, a subdued, radio-friendly, enjoyable, circa 80's, second track: If You Want It. Here is when the album really kicks in, starting with History of Modern Parts 1 & 2. Part 1 sounds like a mash-up of elements sampled from practically every other OMD album (catchy lyrics, driving techno keyboards and moody, ambient, orchestral backgrounds - even the last 30 seconds of the track appears to be ghosts of OMD elements/samples...). Part 2 is similar to Part 1 only slowed down, more epic, dancey and presented from a different angle than part 1. After a few listens, long-time OMD fans should really start to hear the echos of the past in these tracks. Sometimes is reminiscent of the great b-side Sugar Tax and is a welcome change of pace on the album. Rfwk sounds like a glossy, 2010 updated version of something written back in 1980. I personally love OMD songs that start subdued, then build up a ton of momentum and drama, usually ending with Andy McCluskey's heart-felt pleading voice. New Holy Ground is the serious, atmospheric ballad of the album. I love the footsteps providing the back beat. The Future, The Past, And Forever After is pretty good--anthem-y and pretty catchy, but probably my least favorite track (though I imagine a remixed version might be really cool). Ah, here comes pure OMD nostalgia... Sister Marie Says. What an awesome, classic OMD track. I've heard it referred to as the cousin of Enola Gay. Absolutely perfect description of  perfect little pop song. Next comes Pulse. Hey? What is Justin Timberlake doing on an OMD album? On first listen this track feels terribly out of place on an OMD album, but dammit--it's pretty catchy and even though I expect some fans to be really irritated by this song, the more I listen to it, the more I like it. I hear a ton of influence from Apollo (a very strange song on the 1984&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Junk-Culture/dp/B000002GE3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Junk Culture</a>&nbsp;album). (In retrospect: OMD have always thrown a weird track on their albums that make fans scratch their heads--which in my book, is a good thing). Green is also oozing with OMD style and is also a great little track. Bondage Of Fate shows off a mature lyrical style and contains the \"how the heck did they make a waltz beat cool\" vibe from the Maid Of Orleans days. The Right Side? has the feel of Talking Loud and Clear, with a catchy and strange obfuscated sample: \"*something* to the right side?\" Save Me is well, a mash-up. It's ok, but sounds like a B-side to me. If you get the Deluxe version, you get Idea 1, which I absolutely adore. Atmospheric, soundtrack-worthy, minimal, with a simple piano line, sentimental lyrics and interesting samples that make the track very memorable and unique.If you are an OMD fan familiar with their past albums--you will really like History of Modern. If you are a casual or new OMD fan, this album is pretty good, but to gain full appreciation for this album, I really recommend listening to a few past albums for the full effect.

Its great to see the full lineup back togather again, creating magic.\n", "val": 0.06002718210220337}
{"text": "If you are a fan of 80's music or just love great dance-pop, do not miss this one. In my humble opinion it is the best work OMD has ever done. It's as though they have taken their classic synth-pop sound and updated it with a bit of an influence from contemporary electronic artists like Moby, while recalling the song structure of some of their strongest albums like Architecture & Morality and Sugar Tax. My personal faves are \"History of Modern pt. 1\" and \"Rfwk\" but don't skip a single track because you will be missing a compelling song. When the final track arrives, you will be treated to a club-banging single called \"Save Me\" featuring guest vocals from the one and only Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, and if you hadn't already figured it out by then, you will know you have been listening to an \"event\" album.\n", "val": 0.02362111397087574}

Be sure to download the Deluxe edition as it contains 2 extra tracks, one of which is only available on vinyl, as well as the promo video for If You Want It and the EPK.

{"text": "When I first heard OMD was releasing a new album I was excited, as I'd been happy with the past few albums under the guidance of Andy McCluskey - knowing I'd rather have a solo OMD than no OMD. When I heard this new album was going to include all four original members, I was ecstatic.What they've achieved with History of Modern is not only a wink to their past, but a foothold into their future. Saying this is their best album in a few decades is accurate in the way that \"Yes\" was the best album in a few decades for the Pet Shop Boys. It's a return to form. It's a collective example of how a band can use the sounds they've created over the years and breathe new life into them. It's a difficult task for most bands and could have been an uphill battle, but for History of Modern it sounds easy. It sounds natural.Songs like \"HOM Part 1\", \"The Right Side\" and \"New Babies : New Toys\" are absolutely euphoric and beyond anything I'd dreamed imaginable. Others such as \"HOM Part 2\", \"Sometimes\" and \"If You Want It\" are songs that any other band would kill to have in their arsenal of music. Catchy and unforgettable, the songs on HOM are also the best produced I've ever heard from OMD - the production is flawless. No rush job here.With that, I'd say 60% of HOM is outstanding. Pristine pop with one foot planted firmly in the electronic maturity of it all. Another four or so songs are amazingly well crafted and break up the ear candy just enough to let your feet relax and appreciate the depth that this album has to offer. There are a couple tracks that are slow growers, but hey, that's the truth with almost every album - but having a 13-track album of this quality from OMD in 2010? Unheard of, until now. No complaints.What I like most about this album is that OMD have created something that has been needed from them - a benchmark to reflect upon everything they've released in the course of their career while looking forward. Knowing that History of Modern is THIS good, makes me all the more excited as to what the follow up will sound like, as surely this can't be their last album. I'm hoping in many ways this is a new beginning.\n", "val": 0.046156059950590134}
{"text": "There's been a recent resurge of electronic music in the past few years and though it's stayed mostly in UK/Europe and hasn't crossed the pond to the states yet, hopefully with this, the first OMD album in 14 years, that will quickly change!  14 years is a long time but founding members Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys have found a way to bridge the gap of time and produce what could arguably be called one of their best albums of their career. Offering a hybrid of new and old sounds, this gem is likely to not only please the long-standing fans but grab a whole new generation who, perhaps unknowingly, have been listening to OMD through influence in bands such as The Killers and LCD Soundsystem.Opener NEW BABIES: NEW TOYS comes rearing out of the gate with a 'take that' attitude. It's edgier than what many think or remember OMD sounding but easily fits into todays mainstream with its bombastic bass, distorted vocals and heavy, head-bopping beats. It's followed by IF YOU WANT IT, a song written originally by Mr. M. for one of his past girl bands. Filled with a catchy chorus and choral \"aws\" it works, much in thanks to the retention of his valuable vocal quality at the ripe YOUNG age of 51!HoM PART 1 and 2 are definitely OMD in their \"pop hits\" area and PART 1 is, in my opinion, OMD at their best. Mr. H.s synths, earlier described as 'call and reply' play well with Mr. M.s addicting melody, laced with lovely harmonies. I challenge anyone to try sitting still for this one!SOMETIMES is a slower, groovy number with additional vocal samples by Jennifer John to help get across the message of despondent love, while RFWK is one of a couple Kraftwerk-ish songs but rightfully so since it's a tribute to the band and their influences on both Mr. M. and Mr. H. With touching offerings displayed in lyrics \"I loved you when I found you, I loved you like a son\" draped in synthetic, almost whiny keys, it makes one wonder just where these two would be in life had they not been in the crowd at the Kraftwerk show as teens!And then there's NEW HOLY GROUND! This is a definite tear-jerker of a song. It begins with the sound of a woman's high heels hitting the ground as she paces the floor; an absolutely striking element to the song that repeatedly paints a vivid image to match the songs theme of profound self reflection and renewal. Add in deep, cello-like sounds and an achingly beautiful single key melody, along with vocals that crack with emotion and you've got one of the most moving songs on the album! (Plus the fact that it was created in literally hours is just proof of the magic these two can do when in a room together.)THE FUTURE, THE PAST, AND FOREVER AFTER is a quirky little disco ditty that screams Georgio Moroder and could definitely get a dance floor going in both a retro and a modern club. SISTER MARIE SAYS, by Mr. M.s account, was a song shelved way back in the early days for sounding too much like Enola Gay but given new life with modern technology, it's much like the HoMs, good ol' OMD synth-pop!PULSE, ah, PULSE....yes well, to put it mildly, it stands out. It's a song that is probably the farthest from OMD than any can be and will cause many (including myself)to blush or drop the jaw because of it's, shall I say 'adult' nature. It's filled with deep, seductively breathy vocals from Mr. M. with an almost equally alluring female backing track, all layered over an irresistible dance beat. What's not to like?! ;o)After that, the cd takes a slower, more 'back to the beginning' approach. GREEN is in the realm of NHG with it's achingly divine melody and lyrical content that gets matched by Mr. H.s, captivating instrumentation that includes rippling keys and a steady pound. BONDAGE OF FATE is, in many ways, more enthralling than Green or NHG; for some reason it just mesmerizes me. Maybe it's the waltz-like rhythm, or the woman's babbling or the choral sounds...all together it's just wonderful! And THE RIGHT SIDE?, well this is another treasure. Giving one final nod to Kraftwerk, it's plinkering keys and ambient chorals easily make the 8.17 minute song seem to flow by in a smooth, relaxing way.That leaves us with SAVE ME, a track added onto the American release and chosen to be the first single. It's a mash-up between Aretha Franklins Save Me and OMDs classic Messages.  It begins with a computerized Messages entrance followed by a voice announcing \"electronic, solar music\" and that pretty much explains what comes next. Mash-up is a perfect word for this dance hall, hip, and carelessly fun song.I rarely find a cd that doesn't have at least one song I don't like on it but can honestly say I like, and in more cases than not, LOVE the songs here. I'm a longtime fan of OMD so was hoping for a cd I could casually enjoy while rejoicing in the fact they even reformed and made an attempt at new music.  INSTEAD, I got HoM, an absolutely brilliant piece of work that shows these guys still have it and can stand up to any of their counterparts (and surpass them imho).  I think even newcomers to the world of OMD will embrace the caliber of the music on the release. Don't look at this as a 'come back album' from 'an 80s band' because it's so much more than that! It's proof that Mr. M. and Mr. H., who both really never stopped working, can still create wonderous pieces that stand the test of time and conform to the musical world of today while retaining the elements that ARE OMD.  And with the addition of remaining original members Mal Holmes and Martin Cooper and talks of possibly yet another album to follow, I hope to say these guys are here to stay!  A definite 5 stars from me. Welcome back boys!!!\n", "val": 0.030174246057868004}
{"text": "And so the finest band to emerge from the Synth Britannia era return. It is the first studio album since 1986's \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pacific-Age/dp/B0000072OH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pacific Age</a>\" to feature the classic line-up of Andy McCluskey, Paul Humphreys, Martin Cooper and Malcolm Holmes. The original 4-piece split acrimoniously in 1989, following the platinum-selling retrospective, \"The Best of OMD\", the previous year. McCluskey resurrected the brand to varying degrees of success in the 1990s, while Humphreys, Cooper and Holmes formed the ill-fated band, The Listening Pool, after failing in a bid to use the OMD name. Krautrock aficionados McCluskey and Humphreys, the electronic pioneers of such groundbreaking albums as \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Architecture-Morality/dp/B00008NF6J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Architecture & Morality</a>\" and \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dazzle-Ships/dp/B0013E4D9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dazzle Ships</a>\", announced their reunion at a fan gathering in 2005 and consolidated this with successful tours between 2007 and 2009.Many of the tracks had been demoed by McCluskey following his foray into the world of girl group songwriting for the likes of Atomic Kitten and Genie Queen. The current UK single, \"If You Want It\", seems to be a hold-off from this particular period. It was co-written by the girls' vocal coach Tracey Carmen who'd had a hand in the Kittens' \"Be With You\". It is permeated with lyrical clichs, while its musical template is unashamedly deeply rooted on the last OMD hit single, \"Walking On The Milky Way\", from 1996's \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Universal/dp/B000005RQ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Universal</a>\".Perhaps a better choice of single would have been \"Sister Marie Says\", a close relative of \"Enola Gay\" that was part-written in 1981 and later recorded during the \"Universal\" sessions in the mid-90s. It was premiered at the previously mentioned fan event and dusted off by McCluskey for inclusion on the new album - it certainly improves on the original demo and brings the classic OMD sound up to date.And so to the rest of the 13-track album:  On brilliant opener (and future US single) \"New Babies: New Toys\", OMD are fast out of the traps with a New Order-esque track that mirrors the aggressive nature of vintage album openers such as \"Bunker Soldiers\" and \"The New Stone Age\", with its rough-and-ready bass guitar and distorted vocals.  Its lyrical subject is Simon Cowell and the whole `X-factor' and `American Idol' culture (\"It's better with the girls but it's bigger with the boys\").  It has to be taken as being slightly tongue-in-cheek, given that McCluskey was responsible for manufacturing Atomic Kitten!Whilst the momentum is slightly lost with \"If You Want It\", it is quickly restored with Part One of the two album title tracks. Originally titled \"The Big Bang Theory\", it expands upon some of the lyrical themes of the \"Universal\" single and marries the band's trademark choral effects with a memorable synth refrain.  Melodically, it does have some similarities to James' 1992 hit \"Ring The Bells\" but this doesn't detract from what is one of the highlights of this album.Part Two of the title track, the first of three co-writes with co-founder Paul Humphreys, is slightly less memorable, and this particular version of the song frustratingly features some discordant out-of-tune synth sounds which didn't feature on the demo version.Two other Humphreys co-writes, however, rate alongside some of the duo's best work.  \"New Holy Ground\", written and recorded in just a few hours, echoes \"The Avenue\" (the brilliant b-side of 1984's top 5 hit, \"Locomotion\"). It is a reminder of how McCluskey's melancholia used to be the perfect counterfoil to Humphreys' intricate, yet simple, melodies...before the financial allure of America caused the band to implode.  \"Green\", meanwhile, is rescued from the mid-90s vaults by Humphreys who applies some Vince Clarke-esque textures to a great lyric, and a beautiful coda.Kraftwerk's influence is prevalent on at least three songs: Album closer, \"The Right Side?\", is a satisfying 8-minute electro-workout that mirrors elements of the German quartet's \"Europe Endless\" (and samples fellow KlinkKlang enthusiasts Komputer), while \"RFWK\" (Ralf, Florian, Wolfgang, Karl) is a touching love letter to McCluskey's boyhood heroes. There's also a hint of \"Hall of Mirrors\" in the introduction to the aforementioned \"New Holy Ground.\"Elsewhere, the waltz \"Bondage of Fate\", another lyrical highlight of the album, subtly incorporates elements of Hannah Peel's \"Organ Song.\"Whilst there are highlights-a-plenty on this comeback album, there are also a few tracks that don't quite fit in.  I've already mentioned the ill-advised single \"If You Want It\", but elsewhere there is \"Pulse\", a frankly embarrassing attempt at a dancefloor filler which contains breathy, spoken word vocals from McCluskey (with backing vocals from Genie Queen, presumably the song's intended recipients).And then there is \"Sometimes\", which sounds like a Moby tribute track (\"Play\" era), but with a piercing, wailing Macy Gray-like vocal from former Listening Pool backing vocalist, Jennifer John. US versions of the album also feature \"Save Me\", a mash-up of OMD's \"Messages\" and Aretha Franklin's \"Save Me.\"  It's an inoffensive dance track certainly, but does it belong on an album that is purportedly attempting to be \"modern\"?There is also a distinct lack of musical invention on the Moroder-esque \"The Future, The Past and Forever After,\" another track retrieved from the 90s vaults (originally titled \"Wheels of Steel\").Reading between the lines, this is basically another McCluskey solo album with some stylish overdubs and three songwriting contributions from Humphreys, a busy man in his own right with OneTwo, a project he formed with Claudia Brucken of Propaganda fame.The new album lacks the lyrical focus of \"Universal\" and both the musical ambition and creative urgency of earlier albums.  There's an over-reliance on samples and, over all, it's a disjointed effort.  It has been labelled by McCluskey as their best collection of songs since \"Architecture and Morality\".  Sadly, that's just what this album is: a `collection of songs,' and it's certainly nowhere near as cohesive as their flawless 1981 magnum opus.\n", "val": 0.010612426325678825}
{"text": "There are many labels that the band could be pegged with. Synthpop. Electronic. Post Punk. Experimental. Some Trashy Pop Group. That last one was just a tease from the frontman himself. You might only remember the band for their hit single 'If You Leave' - this is at which singer Andy McCluskey joked the above during a live show in 1986: that it took them from the good, old days of dives and Seriously Cool Music to an overnight limelight factory. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were all those things, and more.But why talk in the past? Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark ARE all these things and more. They've steadily built up from a tentative reformation for a series of one off concerts in the mid 00's to an active tour around Europe to promote the 30th anniversary of Architecture and Morality. There have even been a few forays back into Seriously Cool Music with the collaboration of Andy McCluskey, Hambi Haralambous and Peter Saville in The Energy Suite art installation and a glorious show with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra that transformed many of their hits into sublime symphonic seductions.Have I brought you up to speed there? Good. The fine fellows of OMD decided it was time to delve into their creative subconscious once more, to get out a few of those persistently nagging thoughts that musicians often call inspiration. It was the right time. A fresh start after 14 years of radio silence. Not a comeback for the money but a return to the joy of performing music they believed in. This box set is the culmination of that belief and their hard work emanates from every last note. This box set, this album, this cache of songs will entrance the new listener and bring common ground to even the most ardent Seriously Cool Music old fan.Don't come into the listening experience with some idea of how you think they will sound. Pretend it's the first time you've ever heard music in your life. From the opening blasts on New Babies; New Toys to the final echoing refrains on The Right Side?, let your mind walk unfettered through the concept of the music.Imagine yourself turning off your television \"They don't want you, they don't need you, they just use you, they just bleed you.\".Let your cares be lifted \"Nothing stops us, not today\".Posit existence ending \"Everything you take, everything you gave, all the things you found, all the things you made... nothing will remain, cradle or the grave\".Correct your view of the present: \"The last mistake you ever make is thinking modern's new forever\".Wrap yourself in the disquieting truths: \"And it doesn't matter if I say I Love You, no matter how good today is, at the end we just sleep in a bed\".Reach out to that which inspires you: \"The only constant through it all is what you had begun\".Introspection in the city streets: \"There's no way of knowing if this pain will ever fade, there is no denying that this is what we made\".Dance through the shoes and handbags littering the club: \"Like a bullet from a gun it will run, like an arrow from a bow to you, like a speeding train on wheels of steel...\".Consider challenging the religious status quo: \"I don't know exactly what I'd do, if everything she told us would come true\".Know what you like: \"You say that I'm a user, words just confuse ya, it's abuse but that's what you came for\".Accept the way things are: \"And once again the dread, is burning in your head, you try but can't let go, this pain that kills you so \".Embrace commitments: \"it's a beautiful burden, the Bondage of Fate\"Latch onto a lover: \"So which one will you be? The boy who's always broken, the girl in misery?\"The tunes are craftily textured, the lyrics harbor cleverness for sincerity's sake,and the earnest nature of the packaging elevates this project from mere cheers of Still Have It In Them to I Never Knew This Side Of Them. Who needs innovation when revolution is so much more satisfying? Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's History of Modern should be yours today.\n", "val": 0.004964103922247887}

The title track is split in two with part one bouncy and remniscent of their eighties sound, while part two is more sedate but just as catchy.There isn't a duff track; \"Sometimes\" is an enchanting midtempo song, \"RFWK\" (which stands for the initials of the quartet) a rather morose ballad, \"New holy ground\" a rather hymnal ballad with footsteps for a beat, \"The future, the past, and forever after\" a dreamy Dance song with no obvious chorus, \"Sister Marie says\" bouncy Pop with operatic female vocals, and \"Pulse\" is incredibly groovy synth Pop.From here out are synth ballads; \"Green\", \"Bondage of fate\", and \"The right side?\".\"History of modern\" is much more than just nostalgic kitsch.\n", "val": 0.01551520824432373}

{"text": "When I first heard of a new OMD album in 2010, I immediately trembled with excitement, being quite a long-time OMD fan. I read some stuff, listened to the quick listen function on Amazon and bought the album. I was pleased quite immediately and find this a real successful come-back, one of their best albums in years (Andy and Paul even call it their best album since Architecture&Morality).For me, History of Modern is a good return to old relevance and form. OMD are revisiting their past while also taking into account current musical trends and production techniques. I find this album pretty fine and a pleasing listening experience for the most part, albeit not as musically cohesive and brilliant from beginning to end as Architecture&Morality (hence only four stars instead of five).I won't give a detailed song-by-song run-down (that's already been done greatly by rockgirl). My personal highlights here are \"History of Modern part I+II\", \"New Holy Ground\" and \"Sister Marie Says\", all of which contain the ingredients of a brilliant OMD song: catchy synth hooks, great musical arrangements and Andy's deeply reflective lyrics (either positive/hopeful or sad/wistful, but always heartfelt and sincere). Especially \"New Holy Ground\" (my favourite by a small margin) moves me which its perfect OMD minimalism, featuring some sensual female footsteps, beautiful synth string/mellotron arrangement and Andy's deeply emotive lyrics (sad and forward-looking at the same time).The other tracks I find not that great, but there are more little gems interspersed, like the distantly New Order-ish \"New Baby: New Toys\", the lovely Kraftwerk tribute \"RFWK\", or the (lyrically) angst-ridden \"Green\".Apart from some minor disappointments (\"Pulse\", \"Bondage of Fate\"), I really find this a sufficiently good album and fine return to old songwriting greatness. It may not reach the heights of A&M or Dazzle Ships, but it's certainly as good as (if not better) than anything that came after Dazzle Ships.Confidently recommended (at least for OMD fans).btw, the quick listen function on Amazon (e.g. via the Amazon Music Sampler) gives a good opportunity to obtain a first impression of a new musical product and should prevent you from all too disappointing album purchases.When I used this quick listen function for OMD's HoM on Amazon, I was immediately moved by some tracks and ordered the album in no time.

{"text": "My interest in OMD is confined to the first 4 albums and one subsequent single. When they went all chart geared with the bland 'Junk Culture', I couldn't be bothered any further. Even with the albums I do like I find them very spotty, though the most consistent is their debut.Then came the reunion and the new album. I listened to samples of the new album, as well as some interviews, and found that OMD have reassessed their career and also felt their first several albums were their best. Good conclusion. But they also were quick to defend their new album by saying is forward looking without forgetting their past. These aging artists who are clearly trying to recapture the essence of their heyday by having some sort of \"return to form\", only to claim that's not really what they are doing, just need to deal with the fact that you can sound like you did 30 years ago, though with new songs, and still have a reason to be proud of it rather than make excuses for it.With that in mind, I purchased 'History of Modern' with optimism, but was in no way blown away. Yes, they have returned to using some analog equipment, but the songwriting is still a scattered mess. The album opens with the retro analog stylings of New Babies, New Toys, which is an album highlight, but then goes into the awful choice for a first single, If You Want It. We get back to the better material with both History of Modern (Part I and Part II). These are both strong standouts mixing retro with modern with good results. The last truly great song is the 30 year leftover track, Sister Marie Says. It rings of Enola Gay but is more interesting, IMHO. As great as the song is, the video they release for it was one of the worst ideas. Oh well...Aside from the previously mentioned good songs, I find little else on 'History of Modern' to warrant repeated listenings. As far as I'm concerned, it's little more than an EP with a number forgettable fillers. But since I think similar of 'Organisation', I can't be too disappointed...\n", "val": 0.00011073360656155273}

All I have to say about the album is that side one is the smoothest.  The second side starts with \"The Future, The Past, and Forever After\", which I had to get used to, but it segues to the wonderful \"Sister Marie Says\".'Pulse' is another one that takes time to digest.  It's not for everyone.  The rest on side two is great.  I love the last three tracks.  Of note is that the U.S. release that I have has an extra track 14 \"Save Me\" with Aretha Franklin.  The song does stick out because it doesn't sound like the others with only Aretha Franklin singing, but hey it's Aretha Franklin.  How could you not love her.  Actually with that bonus track it segues quite well to the first track when on repeat.With this album I can not believe how they sound.  They sound as if no time has passed since their heyday.  I needed to take a double take.I love this album because they are not trying to be modern.  The inside sleeve has an interesting lesson on the history of modernism.  I love the whole concept.I find it funny that people of my age in their twenties listen to bands that sound like OMD and call them innovative, fresh, new, modern.  But if they listen to the originals like OMD they would call them dated and so 80s.  I hate that.  OMD is awesome and I highly recommend this album.  I would say that I love 95% of the album.  The rest I will get used to.  I can't wait till I love 100% of the album.  I am getting there.  But loving 95% of the album from the first listen means a lot.  Not many album are like this.It is a great new beginning.  I hope more comes from OMD.  Maybe they'll be like the Rolling Stones playing till god knows when.\n", "val": 0.017159150913357735}
{"text": "Wow. Where did this come from? I thought OMD was just another has-been, early eighties, New Wave, New Romantic, Roxy Music clone with a couple of nice tunes from way back when. Then I check this album out from mere curiosity that such a band still even exists, and what do I find but a pop masterpiece that is fully up to the level of the greats of its genre (which is somewhere between Roxy and the equally great Giorgio Moroder).Indeed, this record surpasses its influences in at least one way - the lyrics on this album have remarkable depth for mere techno-pop. The lyrics even seem to be offending some materialist types on this board, which to my mind is a ringing endorsement. But don't even worry about the lyrics, get this one for the sound: still early eighties techno-pop, but with modern production and superb vocals. There are a few tunes on the last half that are too much like contemporary dance tracks, but then again a little variety never hurt and these days it is easy enough to delete tracks not to your taste, and this album has enough great tunes to more than make up for the duds. In fact, I think this is probably a better song collection than this band's greatest hits package. Whoever would have thought?\n", "val": 0.02178039960563183}
{"text": "OMD once wrote a lyric, \"science is never wrong, gravity never fails.\"  Yes when science is done with data driven analysis is it is never wrong, but now OMD writes with lyrics that glorify ignorant superstition, \"set your mind and spirit free.\"  There is no self initiating force in the universe, much less the brain.  There is no spirit inside us anywhere.  We don't have minds.  We have brains and bodies.  We behave!  Based on our experiences and the consequences of every experience we behave AND the cumulative effect of natural selection determines behavior, behavior becomes more or less likely in the future.  That is science.  The miseducation of BS shovelled down the throats of people who have no understanding of the science of human behavior by people that have no undertstanding of human behavior is superstition.  Superstition leads to right wing propaganda and lie after lie of religious controls and mentalistic controls that lead to systems of education. justice, social interaction, health, etc... that all fail because complete stupidity is perpetuated without dire consequences.  The consequences suck! Listening to OMD reject science for BS and spew the same ignorance spouted by every human conditioned to reject conditioning perpetuating problems that are ruining any chance to live long and prosper is just sad and the music is boring.  This production is a tragedy from melody to message.\n", "val": 3.085877688135952e-05}

{"text": "I'm sure there are better informed and more clued in OMD fans out there, but for me OMD's career seems to fall into 3 distinct phases. Phase 1 was the early classic years of moody, dark and somewhat experimental tunes found on their first (classic) album, the totally gorgeous Organisation and the sultry Architecture & Morality. Phase 2 was the 'erm...what are we doing?' period which produced some seriously strange stuff on records like Dazzle Ships and Junk Culture. Phase 3 was the 'we've lost it completely and now write poppy dance nonsense' as found on Pacific Age, Sugar Tax, Universal, etc. History of Modern is from phase 3 and I don't care for it.It's rare that I band I used to absolutely adore can produce something that I absolutely can't stand, but HoM is it. If, like me, you have played OMITD, Organisation and A&M to death over the years, you're going to be scratching your head when you hear the track \"Sometimes\". Seriosuly, what the heck is going on? Some tuneless dirge with a Macy Gray sound-a-like backing vocal. It's truly awful. I should have seen the writing on the wall when they made \"Sister Mary Says\" available as a free download from their website. It could easily have come from any of their phase 3 albums.So, bottom line is, if you loved the early OMD with all their Winston inspired quirkiness and sparse arrangements (think Bunker Soldiers, The Messerschmitt Twins, Statues, Beginning and the End) I don't think you'll find much on History of Modern to entertain you. A comeback wasted. Pity.\n", "val": 2.309038973180577e-05}
{"text": "History Of Modern is the long awaited return for OMD, their first album released in the US in fifteen years. A band that for the most part thought lost in the 80's since the acclaimed \"Crush\" and \"The Pacific Age\", they had a few album released in the 90's that tried to fit the sounds of the time but were for the most part ignored. Mounting a comeback in the 21st century would seem a daunting challenge but one OMD picks up none the less. History Of Modern harkens back to the well produced and thought out albums like Crush. The go back to their signature sounds of electronic strings and chorus-like vocals. Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys high tenor voices sound just as good as back then. They go back to topics they've covered before. Religious themes like Sister Marie Says (available for free at the OMD website) sounds like an updated version of Anola Gay. The refrain of \"New Babies: New Toys (\"It's better for the girls but it's bigger for the boys\") has all sorts of possible imagery. \"History Of Modern part I\" is a techno-dance track with a philosophy of nothing today really matters as the moments move away. Many other tracks song of love and loss. Probably the most catchy song is \"Pulse\" which has a very strong to the classic Laidbach dance track, \"White Horse\". This is unquestionably one of their best efforts. Not a perfect album by any means especially \"Sometimes\" with the constant refrain of \"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child\". But OMD has successfully managed to bridge the decades together to put together a winning and provoking album.\n", "val": 0.0040319873951375484}

{"text": "It's pretty simple. If you are a fan of OMD, especially any of the albums after their more experimental first several, then you should be pretty pleased with HoM. The MP3 samples on Amazon give you a good idea of what to expect, though they don't really do the songs justice. There is a good mix of very good and decent songs, with only one or two clunkers, but taste is subjective and what I like and dislike, you might not. I think it is great to have the whole band back together again and their recaptured (though slightly modernized) sound is proof that even after the so-so albums of the 90s and 00s, they can recapture the magic that made them special.Who is this album not for? Well, I don't think it'll win over many first-time listeners. Not that it isn't good, but it does have a retro sound I don't see getting much airplay these days. Also, the limited edition version w/DVD is only for the completest hard-core fans. Everyone else can save a little money and get the standard edition or download.\n", "val": 0.004023611545562744}

They should have reworked this album until the songs actually solidified.

Why won't they remaster their ENTIRE old catalog instead? That would have bought them more time and earned them extra money from royalties while they reworked these awful and corny tracks.

{"text": "It was 1985, and this song called \"So In Love\" was playing in frequent rotation on the radio. At age 12, I liked it, but it didn't register yet. Flash forward to 1986, \"Pretty In Pink\" is released and \"If You Leave\" shoots up the charts. Great song, now I know who OMD are (or so I think). Flash forward to Christmas 1986, my cousins get me a cassette tape (yes, remember those?) of \"The Pacific Age\" (I know what you're thinking already). I listen to it over and over and decide, yes, I like OMD. Flash forward to 1988, \"Dreaming\" is released, and it is just okay, I think. Then the break-up. I find \"Sugar Tax\" as an import and wonder is this THE OMD? Sure enough, Andy McCluskey pulls a Tears For Fears, and continues on with the band's moniker even though he is the only remaining member of the original band.And so on and so forth. In the early 2000's I get \"Navigation: The B-Sides\" and go back and get everything pre-\"The Pacific Age\", and I am struck by how talented this New Wave band was, and that in America, they were given short shrift, only being known, truly, for \"If You Leave\", when they are so much more than that.2005, OMD re-forms, and promise of a new album starts to percolate. 2010, finally, \"The History Of Modern\"--except it isn't so modern. No, reports state many of these tracks were written before the re-formation, some of them were rejected from Andy McCluskey's pet projects, others were started back in the early 1980's, and still more were started in the 1990's. Hmmm.Well, let's put it this way: I am very happy to have OMD back. It was time for all these current bands who are directly borrowing from greats like OMD, to see how it's done. Bands like White Lies, The Postal Service, Empire Of The Sun, The Killers, Keane, to name but a few.\"History Of Modern\" is the first time in 24 years the original four members have worked on an album together, and the first OMD album in 14 years. With 14 tracks, there are bound to be some great tracks and some weak ones.So let me get the weak ones out of the way first. \"Sometimes\" has to be the weakest track here. The refrain \"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child\" over and over gets real tiresome as moaned by either Jennifer John or Lucy Styles. Very annoying, along with the hip-hop record scratching, this song is the worst track here. The other track, as much as I like Aretha Franklin, is \"Save Me\". I didn't feel like it belonged here, and it didn't. It's a bonus track on the U.S. edition.Now the great songs: \"New Babies: New Toys\" is a great album opener that doesn't just have trademark OMD synths, but some guitar heft as well. \"If You Want It\" is a solid ballad that follows. My favorite track on the entire album is \"History Of Modern, Pt. 1\". This is what OMD does best, and I think to myself, Coldplay gets all over the radio with \"Viva La Vida\", a song that's not that far removed from \"History Of Modern, Pt. 1\", but OMD get no airplay. Hmmm. \"History Of Modern, Pt. 2\" rounds out the first four tracks very nicely. Then we're hit with \"Sometimes\", followed by the okay tracks \"RFWK\" and \"New Holy Ground\".The second half of the album starts with an almost disco sounding \"The Future, The Past, And Forever After\" which is okay. \"Sister Marie Says\" has been compared to \"Enola Gay\", and I get the comparison, but \"Sister Marie Says\" still has enough about it to set it apart from \"Enola Gay\". Still, it's an okay song. Now, I know I'm going to hear complaints about this, but I actually liked \"Pulse\". I thought it was a different style that OMD actually did quite well. In fact, as I listened to it, I thought of Duran Duran, and that \"Pulse\" could have been taken from their 2007 album \"Red Carpet Massacre\" (take note Duran Duran, you're being reviewed in February 2011 with your new album). \"Green\" is good, and so is \"Bondage Of Fate\". My second favorite track is \"The Right Side?\" Sprawling out to eight minutes, this song gets the Kraftwerk treatment, and perhaps the closest track to a Human League track musically (take note Human League, you will be reviewed when your new album is released in March 2011).On first listen, the album sounded better than it actually was. With repeated listening, I felt I came up with a more accurate rating for this album. It has some very good tracks, quite a few okay tracks, and a couple of undesirable tracks. There is a good deal of variety here, so nothing to get bored with. Overall, a very strong return to form for a band that has not worked on an album in 24 years! Also, like always, prior to listening to \"History Of Modern\", and went back to the beginning and listened to each OMD album in sequential order so as to hear how the band changed over the years. \"History Of Modern\" is definitely a mash of up of all different phases of their career with a heavier leaning towards their middle and late career rather than their first four albums (I know this may disappoint some fans, but I like all phases of OMD).So here is how \"History Of Modern\" rates next to their previous works:1980 Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark: Four Stars1980 Organisation: Four and a Half Stars1981 Architecture & Morality: Five Stars1983 Dazzle Ships: Five Stars1984 Junk Culture: Four Stars1985 Crush: Three and a Half Stars1986 The Pacific Age: Three and a Half Stars1991 Sugar Tax: Three and a Half Stars1993 Liberator: Two and a Half Stars1996 Universal: Four Stars2010 History Of Modern: Four Stars\n", "val": 0.0008096554665826261}

Roberts gets excellent support from talented producers and musicians. It's just that Roberts, who has a hand in writing every track, has a heart to console and encourage those weighed down by life. Encouragement may be an overlooked ministry, but it has never been more vital.Hope gets expressed in thoughtful ways. It's a little like taking the lyrics of Cindy Morgan and combining them with the vocals of Jana Long (Avalon) and Nicol Sponberg (formerly Selah). All three of these women could serve as wonderful mentors.The music varies. \"No Matter What,\" released as a single, has a programmed hip-hop rhythm, which works well. There are hints of this elsewhere, but Roberts also uses pop, rock, soul, gospel, inspirational and even club music. Speaking of the latter, \"Outcast,\" is a sassy dance song about self acceptance in the face of being rejected as not good enough by the in-crowd. Cindy Morgan shares writing credits.\"Love Comes Down,\" produced by Brown Bannister, has a small gospel choir that gives it extra punch. The closing, \"Savior to Me (Sing Glory),\" is a song of worship.Lyrically, the words are subtle enough to appeal to non-Christians and could serve as a bridge to faith. The encouragement to never, never, never give up (as John Wesley put it) is universally appreciated.This pastor's daughter succeeds in her stated purpose: \"I want every song to leave people with a sense of purpose - a call to action, a realization of truth, a promotion of hope and healing.\"\n", "val": 0.030322467908263206}

{"text": "What do you do next, when you have done it all before.  Israel, Aaron and Tommy are all very accomplished, and their passion for God and Music is very evident.  Their melodies are often complex, different and, without a doubt, creative.On this disc I believe they sat and thought 'what can we do to make good music, make it different, and get the refreshing message of God out', and hence what you get on this set is more message, than melody; more substance, than worship; more to offer, than more of the same...and I think most appropriate for this time, this season.Whilst as some have stated, the album does not have an instant hit, what it does have is a moment causing the listener to reflect and focus on a message for purpose in their lives.  The songs surround themselves with messages of something that Israel has been saying often nowadays, and that is how can we, how can you, what will we do, what will you do, to make a difference for 'others'.  Case and point is 'Love Rev'.I've always said that Israel is the truth, and by that I mean Israel is anointed to reflect the truths of society, and to encourage us all to make a positive difference in each others' lives.  A time for change.So I say, Be an answer, Be a solution, Be charitable, Give Time to others, Love Hosanna with all your heart, and Love People.The disc has many complex and beautiful musical arrangements..Enjoy...but also hear the heart of the righteous, feel the words that are sung, see the actions of God for this moment as you listen, and I'm sure you will get the true meaning and purpose of this disc.Just as a side, I bought this disc along with Darwin Hobbs' 'Champion' which can be said is good and more in line with the expected worship songs, but as I listened I found myself missing and drawn to wanting to hear the Love God, Love People disc......and I asked myself 'why was this'.  I think the simple answer is...more is being said on Israel's disc.A good disc, not a great disc but one to enjoy for its message, if for nothing else.\n", "val": 0.015446807257831097}
{"text": "This is not a congregational album. This is a return to contemporary soloing, that allows Israel to express wider avenues of his talent and reach others with his calling.Overall, this album was a good listen for me. He could have used the choir to do a medley but he didn't. It just feels like there was so much more he wanted or could have done with this album. It's a sure a keeper for those Israel followers, but I don't think its a strong enough album for those interested in more soulful congregational songs. Go pick up his first 4 albums if u looking for that.My points though.-Definitely more cohesive than Power of One, but some songs choices don't feel like they are as integrated into the overall message of the album.- Songs seem to be very evenly toned..Love God Love People & Yahweh are nice and have the potential to be those run away hits though, but hit or no hit, the message of the entire album is great.-Listening sequentially, to me, it sounds like some songs are missing in between tracks. To me it feels like there could be more. He did really well on making the songs flow into each other, and as always there are a good listen, and even more, the words (message) is great, and yes, u can move to the beat. I still feel like there is more to this album; like some hidden tracks that just weren't included- Hosanna is the My Tribute of this album. like the last album - Power of One- there was no real soulful song until the last track that felt thrown on. the message is good, but I think the attempt at integrating the song could have been worked on. like with the Live albums, there were introductory songs before the great hit worship song, for example. everything that came before Alpha & Omega, on that Live album, was a hit and a nice set up for the stellar - hit Alpha & Omega, there's  nothing like that on this album, nor Power of One before it.\n", "val": 0.006880178116261959}

Israel is one of few christian/gospel artists who cater effectively to a multi-age and multi-cultural congregation, in my opinion. Not only are his songs beautiful, inspired, and powerful for P&W, but most of them are easily modified to unison for new singers that cannot harmonize as well yet. The fact that his songs are so well written is great for the confidence of our singers and makes my job easier (as far as retention and motivation), so Israel is one of my favorite artists to draw from.The chord charts and lyrics are a great time saver on this disc, as I'd otherwise spend hours compiling them myself. And, of course, if you are great at sight reading, the music will save you a lot of time also. I really appreciate that Israel is issuing his music in this form (it's much better than a clunky book. books fall apart). It saves praise & worship directors/leaders a lot of stress and time.

In all fairness, while I'm a Israel & NB faithful supporter, honestly this CD had to grow on me at first.  I was used to the dive-in direction he showed with his earlier LIVE albums... then studio recorded 'Power of One' came out, gave some solid tracks in that same 'AnotherLevel' flow, but he also showed this edgier, experimental side that I was definitely feeling a lot. Looks like he chose to stay in the newer experimental direction with LoveGodLovePeople :) There were really only 3 tracks that had to grow on me (the title track 'LGLP', 'Love Rev', & 'You Won't Let Go'), and only one that i just do not like ('Mercies'). The rest of the tracks: instant love. Best tracks on the album are probably 'Surprises', 'Name of Love', and 'Others'. Used a very eclectic sampler of genres, and 'Name of Love' is hands down the most genre-eclectic track of them all. This album makes a great attempt to stretch our narrowed, scarred perspectives on love: from God to us, from us to others, from us to God.

On track 10 it was great to hear Fred on the bass, great duet, about time. To be fair, I didn't particuarly care for the Kirk Franklin song, track 9 (different audience). Israel has done it again yall. Heavy bass on Name of Love. Track 6, and 7 will move you into a higher place of worship also.I still have The Power of One in my c.d. changer, sorry but Love God, Love People took the top stop. As this review is being written, my wife is being moved with tears, not because of who Israel is, but because of the anointing God has placed on this young man.Israel, stay TRUE TO THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS and He will continue to bless you.GET THIS C.D.

It's easy to get into the presence of God with that song. I also like \"You Hold My World\" that song really encourages me when I need it. It helps me hold onto my faith when life get tough.One of the other things I like about Israel's solo albums, is that you can tell Israel likes to jam. A good example is the song \"Surprises\". I love that song because that's just good music. I'm glad they didn't make it short. I love playing that when I'm driving or relaxing.I bought the MP3 version of this album, so I was given the \"Love God Love People (Incorporated Elements Remix (Bonus Track))\" which I like too. I like it just as much as I do with the original version of \"Love God Love People\".So if you're looking for some good Christian music, that's not typical, you shouldn't be totally disappointed. There's plenty of styles of music on this album for your taste. There's one song called \"You Won't Let Go\" that has a ska style to it.

Steve Gadd on \"Pit\", and Peter Erskine on \"Modern Times.\"  Gadd plays well.  His style is all his own.  And I have to say he is one of my favorite drummers.  But, Peter Erskine is more of a chameleon, choosing styles that differ more for each song.  The difference is most noticable on \"Sara's Touch\", a song of exquisite beauty composed by Mike Mainieri, the vibes player.  I have the recording \"Wanderlust\" by Mike Mainieri with Peter Erskine on drums and Marcus Miller on bass (as I recall.)  I consider this a much more sensitive version of the song.Back to \"Smokin' in the Pit\" - It is nonetheless an exciting session by top notch musicians.  Michael Brecker, Eddie Gomez and Don Grolnik round out the list.  On this session a lot of jamming goes on.  They can be long, but I hasten so say not too long.  This is certainly not a flaw, just different. I just expected more of the ground breaking style of their later recordings.\n", "val": 0.013225692324340343}

{"text": "\"Smokin' in the Pit\" is what every jazz recording should be. This was the first of the Steps/Steps Ahead releases and the best one. This is a jazz recording that is all acoustic (unlike the rest that were fusion). The band is made up of  all-star calibre players. Mike Manieri is the best vibraphonist that I have ever heard(Sorry Mr. Burton). Eddie Gomez is solid throughout the whole disc and fills out the low end. His playing isn't virtuostic in nature but he does what every bassist should do; Be the link between rhythm and melody and he does this extremely well. Don Grolnik is an accomplished pianist and he doesn't dissapoint here. Steve Gadd is one of the greatest drummers to have ever stepped behind a kit and the performance on this disc is his best. This rhythm section makes every tune a lesson in jamming together and creating a groove without getting boring/repetetive. With the grooves that are created by Gomez/Gadd anybody would sound like a Juliard graduate and these soloists sound unearthly. All of these musicians are amazing but the headliner of this set is the sax playing of one Michael Brecker. He is quite possibly the greatest  saxophonist ever and ,at the least, he is the heir to the Parker/Coltrane throne. This man has to be heard to be believed. As for the songs themselves, all are great at the least. The unreal ones are; both versions of \"Not Ethiopia\" of  which one version has Kazumi Watanabe playing a fine guitar solo. \"Recordame\" which is a showcase for Brecker and Gadd. Gadd delivers an incredible polyphonic solo at the end of this piece. The tune \"Sarah's Touch\" is  my personal favorite. It contains Mr. Brecker at his best ,blending speed and phrasing to unveil to the listener one of the most amazing things that they will ever hear. This disc is unbelievable. Anyone that is currently listening to fusion or any other type of instrumental music will find this to be a perfect introduction to jazz. BUY THIS NOW!!!!\n", "val": 0.039926763623952866}

The multiple takes of certain songs shows the evolution and creative fearlesness these artists have to offer both indevidually and as a group. Michael Brecker is such an amazing sax player, it will take you many listenings of this 2 CD collection to even begin to grab his emotion.  His technical virtuosity shines at first listen, but although Michael has said he probably plays too many notes, they all are in the right place at the right time! Mike only plays with the best, and that's evident with this band which was actually formed in a jazz club that Mike and brother Randy (Brecker Bros. band) owned.  These artists are on such a high level of musicianship that is seems like they are reading each others' minds! If you enjoy this double CD and happen to have a DVD player, you NEED to get \"Steps Ahead - Live in Tokyo 1986\".  It will show the further evolution of the band and Mike's sax AND EWI playing.

{"text": "Sufjan Stevens is one of those few artists who can truly stun you with just how passionate and talented he is. Need an example? Take the shimmering, enchantingly lovely \"All Delighted People EP,\" which is actually longer than many full-length albums -- colorful folk pop, warbly vocals, and a strong religious slant.\"Tomorrow you'll see it through/The clouded out disguises put you in the room,\" Stevens sings mournfully in \"All Delighted People (original),\" which drifts between soft, bittersweet folk-rock and an epic song of soaring angelic choirs and sweeping strings.As if the music wasn't good enough, Stevens sings of overcoming inner fear, doubt and hypocrisy (\"I tried my best I tried in vain/Oh! But the world is a mess! Oh! But the world is a mess!\"). There's also  a brass-soaked \"classic-rock\" version of the title track, which sounds far more cheerful despite having the same lyrics.I think my brain would explode if the entire album was like that, so fortunately the next songs are less intense. Instead, Stevens relies on soft piano-led melodies, earthy guitar folk, twinkly soaring little ballads (from the POV of God?), and murky experimental ballads. And it ends with \"Djohariah,\" a seventeen-minute rock epic of squiggling synth,  trumpets and melancholy guitar.\"All Delighted People\" is an almost perfect example of what Sufjan Stevens can do. Without losing sight of his classic sound (the classic rock \"All Delighted People\" made me flash back to his first album), Stevens manages to expand his sound to include some new, spellbinding musical journeys. The first song is a trip all on its own!In fact, there's only one song that didn't blow me away: \"The Owl and the Tanager,\" which isn't bad so much as kind of... musically slow.His music centers mostly on folk-rock rhythms, with lots of acoustic guitar and piano. But many of the melodies are dressed up with colorful sonic garlands -- plucked harp, violins, flittering/squiggling synth, and blasts of brass. And there are those crystalline vocals that soar up in \"All Delighted People (original)\" and \"From The Mouth of Gabriel,\" as if he's getting some angelic backing.Speaking of which, Stevens inserts gentle Christian undercurrents into a few of the songs -- not the \"rah rah Jesus is awesome!\" type, but haunting explorations of sorrow, fear and humanity. The rest of the EP is about love -- rejected love, shattered love , lost love (\"And if it grieves you to stay here, just go... For I have no spell on you, it's all a ghost\"), and love for someone who has been betrayed.The \"All Delighted People EP\" is not only longer than most full-length albums, but it's a layered, exquisite little collection of songs that deserves repeated listens.

{"text": "For those struggling with multifarious bleeps, electronica and 25 minute mini symphonies which comprise the new and amazing Sufjan Stevens \"The Age of Adz\" turning the clock back a couple of months might provide some solace. \"All delighted people\" was released in August 2010 and hit number 27 in the American charts which is remarkable for an EP which is actually a \"front\" for a full album. It clocks in at well over an hour and was probably intended as some sort of overture before the main opera that is \"Adz\". Yet as always when it comes to this wunderkid of modern American music from Detroit, Michigan appearances can be deceiving. This is by any standards a lovely piece of music with songs that have more traditional structures and possibly more melody than \"Adz\" (although not the sheer level of outright originality). In one sense it does have the same sort of feel as the eclecticism of \"Avalanches\" Stevens's album of outtakes and extras from the Illinois album and like that album there are some tracks which are slightly \"wayward\", but largely in a good way.There is certainly no coherent vision to or concept to be found here. The two long versions of the title track present are acoustic and electric versions which together last well over twenty minutes and with a feel that suggest Stevens is developing \"prog\" leanings and lyrics which play with Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Sound of Silence\". The last track \"Djohariah\" (dedicated to his sister) is described by Stevens as essentially \"a 17-minute guitar jam-for-single-mothers\" which on occasions rages like the return of Frank Zappa with a slightly distorted guitar and a choir singing a constant refrain of the subjects name.While all these long bookend tracks are fascinating it is \"the meat in the sandwich\" that should draw your attention. The stellar highlight is \"the Owl and the Tanager\" (previously called \"Barn owl, night killer\") which is a heartbreaking Stevens melody combined with the sparest piano/harp and lyrical references to devil birds, death and diamonds in the rage. It's all very enigmatic, strange, child like and glacially beautiful and one of his best songs ever. There are other songs here that can be traced back to earlier work particularly the feast of banjo led melancholy on the wonderful \"Seven Swans\". Thus, \"Arnika\", \"Heirloom\" and the truly brilliant \"From the mouth of Gabriel\" will have the ring of familiarity to fans of the wintry acoustic songs of Stevens's earlier work. Finally \"Enchanting ghost\" is a jazzy acoustic lament which could have happily appeared on one of his \"Two state\" albums.NME has described \"All Delighted people\" as painfully celestial balladeering self-indulgence and it is true that in parts its lacks focus and direction (it would be a shock if it was coherent!). Similarly the absence of \"Majesty Snowbird\" a song he has performed live which redefines the word \"epic\" is to be regretted. But on considered judgement let us tell the muso's at NME to politely take a hike since \"All delighted people\" will be welcomed by all Asthmatic Kitty Aficionados as yet another intriguing addition to the canon of the most original musician currently picking up a guitar, playing a piano or plucking a banjo on terra firma.\n", "val": 0.0025351878721266985}

Yes, everthing around those 4 chords changes quite consistently, but in the end it's too little pay off for the insane-asylum-inducing repetition.

{"text": "To call \"All Delighted People\" an e.p. is a bit of a misnomer. Since the music clocks in at over 60 minutes - much longer than many \"full length\" recordings (l.p.'s?) - it must simply refer to the relatively few number of tracks (by Sufjan's standards). Many of us probably expected Sufjan to spend the rest of his life finishing his promising \"50 States\" project. It's obvious by now, that aint happenin'. But that is no cause for disappointment. Anyone familiar with Sufjan's music knows that the only thing you can expect from him is for him to defy expectations, anyway. This latest installment is no exception. While it steps back from the edgy, purely instrumental offering of The B.Q.E., it is easy to see the musical ancestry from that recording to this. What strikes me more than anything on \"All Delighted People\" is Sufjan's obvious vocal development since his last vocal offering. Known for his soft, plaintively beautiful vocals, Sufjan actually sounds like he is straining himself to reach new heights on this recording. Combined with his \"everything-including-the-kitchen-sink musical approach, the results are exciting (not always the first adjective that comes to mind in describing his music), pleasing and impressive.

{"text": "I like Sufjan a lot. His lyrics have such a wonderful way of drawing me into intimate stories before yanking me back out to take a look at my own life, America, God, and much more. His music, as he describes it, is often the perfect combination of high art and low art, merging the warmth of folk music with the grandiose of a symphony orchestra. When these elements are at full effect as they are throughout much of Illinois, Michigan, and Seven Swans, he hits me like few others can.Then there are moments where his ambitions seem to run off and leave me in the cold emotionally. Long, flute-heavy instrumentals, while still technically impressive, never connect for me the same way he does in simpler moments like his astounding Casimir Pulaski Day.As you might expect, this EP (which only maybe qualifies as such based on its hour-long run time) leans a little more toward the latter style. The title tracks are a suitably epic ode to the apocalypse, which I can't claim to have fully absorbed yet. The Owl and the Tanager is a gorgeous piano-driven song, and the closing track a 17 minute guitar song for single mothers. The point is, this is some eccentric and wildly creative stuff. Fortunately for fans, it's also really really good once you take the time to get into it.I'd also highly recommend streaming it off his site at [...] before buying it.

In listening to this album, one has to appreiciate the fact that Sufjan wants to try to new things and find new avenues of expression.  Therefore I think it is an interesting intellectual exersize for committed fans, but I would stay away from it if you're a casual fan drawn to songs like Chicago.  But as one who appreciates that Sufjan is always learning, always experimenting, I really look forward to what he will bring out in the future.\n", "val": 0.007698287256062031}

{"text": "i know.  who cares about my personal listening history with sufjan stevens...?  somehow, it seems relevant to me.  i bought \"seven swans\" upon its release all those years ago.  i played it; i liked it.  i liked some of it a lot.  i was not driven to purchase his other releases.  what did i care about michigan and illinois(e)?  then i saw that some magazine had rated \"the age of adz\" as the album of the year.  i was curious.  i bought it.  i thought, \"this guy is either a genius or the biggest show-off of all time.\"  after a few more listens, i was flabbergasted and was forcing people to listen.  i had to know if others heard what i heard....if they would be as overwhelmed as i was...  needless to say, it didn't take me long to go out and get \"illinoise\", \"michigan\", \"enjoy your rabbit\", \"the avalanche\", \"a sun came\", and, finally, \"all delighted people.\"  (i have the christmas set on order.)  (the \"bqe\" will be next.  somehow i know it.)i see the number of reviews some of sufjan stevens' albums have received, and i was shocked to see how few reviews have been written about \"all delighted people.\"i know i've played it fifty times in the past few weeks.  i wonder if people are avoiding it because of it being labelled an ep.  it's over an hour of incredible, intense, beautiful, heart-crushing, unbelievable music.  i think, with this one, i've answered my own question.  he may be a show-off....he MAY be, but, without a doubt, something is going on here.  this man is shocking in his ambition...and he pulls it all off.  i am astonished; i find myself listening in disbelief.  occasionally i have flashes of certain phases of todd rundgren; at other times, i am reminded of van dyke parks' \"song cycle,\" but, ultimately, this is music that, as far as i know, could only have been created by sufjan stevens.i haven't been this musically obsessed in a long time, and it feels really good.  :-)throughout this intense avalanche of his music, \"all delighted people\" seems to be my favorite.  i wonder how different the listening experience would have been if i had listened to each one upon its release instead of bombarding myself with all of it pretty much all at once.  for one thing, i might be less exhausted from the intensity.i vote \"genius.\"\n", "val": 0.011788150295615196}
{"text": "Why is this classified as an EP, I ask you? It is more full of ideas, beauty, pathos, experimentation, and yes, length, than many releases nowadays. I have loved all of Sufjan Steven's work ever since picking up Seven Swans years ago (though Sun and Rabbit are not quite as quality filled, in my opinion), but even I did not expect the effect this cd would have on me. Being an older music fan, longer songs have always appealed to me (yeah, my prog love is showing), and this cd is stuffed with them. But, they never wear on me, I never grow bored...I just want to put on the headphones and tune the world out. I have listened to his cd so many times since buying it, I cannot even begin to count...sometimes several times in a row.An added bonus is having my 10 year old daughter, after overhearing it in my studio, becoming just as attached to the cd as I am (and even branching out into Simon and Garfunkel because of the repeated homage in one of the songs). After exposing her to more Stevens, she is probably the only 10 year old repeatedly listening to a beautiful song about a serial killer (John Wayne Gacey, from the Illinois album). Is that a good thing? I think it is.This is the music I want to soothe me on my deathbed.\n", "val": 0.009429404512047768}

{"text": "I don't always enjoy everything that Sufjan performs, and I'm STILL not on board with the ADZ album, cos of the electronica is harsh, and not the most original sound right now either. However, Michigan, Illinois, A Sun Game, became favorite albums for me...at least most of the songs were hits on my stereo. ALL DELIGHTED PEOPLE ranks as a true breakthru from MY perspective. (OK, its not a symphony with a film, but it IS filled with top notch songs, filled with Sufjan's  amazing music.) Buy this album for two songs, DJOHARIAH, a 17 minute song dedicated to Sufjan's sister, and the \"classic rock\" version of ALL DELIGHTED PEOPLE. Actually, I downloaded DJOHARIAH and listened to it so much, i bought the whole \"EP\". While most of the songs have the common folk elements in much of his music, the choirs, the banjo, the religious imagery in the lyrics, the post rock song structures, etc, there are also the rock songs, that truly stand out. FROM THE MOUTH OF GABRIEL ranks as the best of the folk songs, with little bits of electronica seeping in, like in many areas of the album. However, its those two \"ROCK\" songs that place this title as a VERY important work in his repetoire. DJOHARIAH works, like those long, trippy rock songs, that incessantly build, as some total freakout guitar playing screams on, from the late 60s/early 70s. (PICTURE: the guitar solo from FUNKADELIC's MAGGOT BRAIN meets FRANK ZAPPA's HOT RATS.) Once more, Mr. STevens assimulates a style and transcends it concurrently. NOTHING about this song is dated, unlike some psychedelic styles that hung on from the Classic Rock period. Four chords, wordless voices, and a TOTAL FREAK OUT guitar solo that just keeps coming at you, and coming at you, while DJOHARIAH is repeated like a mantra guarenteed to produce musical transcendance. Maybe 8 or 9 minutes of this incredible build up during the song, with the guitar solo just growing more insane, until the tension breaks, and the song changes gears, for a few verses to discuss the situation at hand. After we find out what's up with Sufjan's sister, we go back to the empowering blow out guitar solo, while EVERYTHING builds up around it, right to a bottomless abyss of psychedelic soundscapes. Those 17 minutes of song glide past timelessly, and takes the breath away. WHen the song ends, after your mind returns, your first thought might be \"OH, it ended TOO SOON!\", which is exactly what a 17 minute song SHOULD do. The other BIG NUMBER is ALL DELIGHTED PEOPLE (I enjoy the CLASSIC ROCK version). That song begins in a folk vein, vocals and banjo, with little rock instrumentation. The second verse contains horn charts, rhythm section of bass and drums, and the backing vocals. Again, this song's textures build, and contain a wonderful horn chart solo. Interestingly, Simon and Garfunkel's SONG OF SILENCE gets quoted during the song's lyrics repeatedly. Then, the last two minutes of ALL DELIGHTED PEOPLE has that FREAK OUT guitar solo, like what's on Djoriah, but overdubbed with a sonic blast of ambient, atonal electronica.If you are a Sufjan Steven's fan, I don't think you can go wrong with this album. Personally, I find it closer to his \"classic\" style from the state albums, especially with the way his textures work, from thick to thin on the turn of a dime. For his long term fans, its the LONG composistion itself, and the freak out guitar solos, that mark this album as unique, and a step beyond Sufjan's music previous to this album. (Plus, this album points the direction he took towards the electronica in ADZ.) So, don't think of ALL DELIGHTED PEOPLE as a minor piece, an \"EP\". The album version of this \"EP\" is two records long! Between the melodic folk songs, and the psychedelic art rock experiment dedicated Sufjan's sister Djorahiah as a single mother, you will be, DEFINATELY WILL BE, BLOWN AWAY.\n", "val": 0.01794729009270668}

Other things, though, are a bit overdone - see the final track. But on the whole, I still find everything by Stevens worth having.\n", "val": 0.05266733095049858}
{"text": "Usher did himself some favors by releasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Raymond-v-Raymond/dp/B002RAREAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Raymond v.

I was one of few (it seems) who liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Here-I-Stand/dp/B0015519VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Here I Stand</a>&nbsp;, though I never considered it superior to Raymond's exceptional&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Confessions/dp/B0001F7UHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Confessions</a>, his very best album.  Raymond v. Raymond was not my favorite album of 2010 by any means, despite being an avid fan of Usher, however as I've stated already, it did help to re-establish his fan base after many faded between the four-year hiatuses between 'Confessions' and 'Here I Stand.'  However, 'Raymond v. Raymond' underwrites Usher's vocal talent with clubby and sometimes sub-par material.  In other words, lyrical substance and overall substance of that album seem empty.  The accompanying EP&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Versus/dp/B003V6L932/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Versus</a>&nbsp;just might be worse.  A nine-song set tacked on as a separate EP or as the second disc of the reissue of Raymond v. Raymond, it is no 'Confessions Special Edition'.  From the packaging, one instantly sees that this was a rush deal and that while some of this new songs are enjoyable enough, they ultimately possess even less substance than Raymond itself.\"Love `Em All\" opens the album smartly with solid production work ala contemporary R&B and a strong vocal performance by Usher.  It is by no means `the second coming,' but it works and it does establish Usher better than the odd \"Monstar\" did on Raymond vs. Raymond.  It fails as being a strong opener like \"Love in This Club\" (Here I Stand) or \"Yeah!\" (Confessions), but you take what you can get with this EP.  \"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love,\" featuring Pitbull just doesn't really appeal to me.  I don't feel that Usher's voice is best reflected with a euro-pop styled production as the canvas underlying it.  Usher pulls it off - I hardly think anyone would deny him that - but it just seems like \"sell-out\" given his prodigious vocal abilities and natural talent.  It's average or just the slightest bit in my mind, but that's not saying much for the man who has given the R&B/pop worlds numerous memorable songs and performances.\"Hot Tottie,\" featuring Jay-Z is ok.  It's not horrible but it's not great.  If anything, it is a bit odd; the production work is interesting, the hook is incredibly wordy, and Jay-Z's guest spot is ok, if less than stellar.  I like it well enough, but then again, I don't love it and I feel that the sheen will quickly wear off, as much of generic R&B and pop does these days.  \"Lay You Down\" adds some `ummph' to the album returning Usher to his 1990s glory days with a traditional, contemporary R&B production supporting him.  Solid, \"Lay You Down\" will be the cut everyone will pass over on this EP that is probably better than all the rest.\"Lingerie\" is a bit of a throwaway completely in my mind that is NOT catchy in my eyes.  Usher sounds good, if uninspired as the combination of his brilliant falsetto and the wordiness of the hook make the lyrics almost impossible to decipher.  I don't connect to this song, but when the track is entitled \"Lingerie,\" it gives a connotation of \"sleaze,\" which is unfortunate.  \"There Goes My Baby\" is filler material considering it appears on 'Raymond v. Raymond,' though it is also a smart addition given the fact it is probably the best cut, hands down.  My favorite club cut that is the most genuine to me is \"Get in My Car,\" featuring Bun B.  The production work is strong without compromising Usher's style as much as \"DJ Got Us Fallin in Love\" and it is enjoyable without growing annoying.\"Somebody to Love [Remix],\" featuring Justin Bieber is a bit weird.  Maybe it is because I'm used to `the Biebz' singing the majority of it and it just doesn't completely fit Usher (maybe there's a reason!) I give it a B... I supposed.  Closer \"Strangers Come\" comes over as a `stranger' as the track isn't that memorable.The problem is that Usher seems to be conforming too much, as many R&B artists are today.  The problem with this EP is that there is no cohesiveness.  It is all over the place with no connection, much like some of Raymond v. Raymond only the effect is times ten. I'm sure \"DJ Got Us Fallin in Love\" will aid in sales, but I'd like to hear the Usher I came to know and love with hits like \"U Don't Have To Call\" or \"Burn.\"  2 1/2 stars/C-...\n", "val": 3.121496774838306e-05}
{"text": "After 2008'S underrated  Here I Stand, Usher returned this past spring with the double platinum selling Raymond Vs. Raymond.  With the club bangers Lil Freak, the pop orientated OMG and the slow jam There Goes impacting radio, Usher was ready to reclaim his thrown as the King Of R&B/Pop.  With Versus, Usher displays more of the lover man swagger that was evident on Raymond Vs. Raymond, gone is the married father who sang about being a one woman man on tracks like Here I Stand & Something Special from 2008's Here I Stand. On tracks such as Hot Tottie feat Jay-Z and the album's opener Love Em' All, Usher croons about his love for all of the ladies. Unlike the recent albums from Dru Hill & R. Kelly, Usher doesn't use the voice box, instead he lets his natural do what it does best. My only complaint with the album is the reuse of There Goes My Baby from Raymond Vs. Raymond, Usher could have easily given another slow cut to go along with the excellent Lay You Down. Versus is a worthy companion piece to Raymond Vs. Raymond with a little something for every musical taste from Grown & Sexy R&B ( Lingerie) pop ( DJ'S Got Us Fallin In Love & Somebody to Love ) and southern Hip Hop ( Get In My Car feat.

{"text": "Even though it has only been five months since the release of \"Raymond V. Raymond,\" Usher has done the right thing by not resting on hits like \"OMG,\" \"Lil Freak\" and \"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home\").\"  Singing \"I'll be knocking till you let me in\" on \"Versus\" (\"Stranger\"), Usher comes hard with a nine track disc filled with at least seven previously unreleased songs and one of his strongest singles to date (\"There Goes My Baby\").Seemingly obsessed with Hot & Cold throughout the effort, as he spends much time talking about keeping his love interest warm on a cold and lonely night (\"When you're cold, I want to be the one that keeps you warm; I'm so cold that I need a hot tottie\"), Usher kicks off \"Versus\" (EP) with what you could call `The Trinity' -- three songs that will make you want to pick up the album or at least download them.\"Love Em All\" leads with the newly single father of two declaring \"Ladies Get In Line, I'm gonna take you back to school\". Credited to Esther Dean and Prettyboifresh, among others, \"Love Em All\" is like Usher's official press release -- \"I'm a free to get at every girl kind of guy\". In case you didn't understand that, Usher breaks it down on \"Love Em All,\" singing \"lately I've been an oh I'm in love kind of guy, now I'm a single, beat it up kind of guy.\"`Hot Tottie,\" a song released earlier this month (Aug. 6), is the defining track on \"Versus\" however. Following \"Love Em All\" and the equally club friendly \"I'm single and ready to party\" lead single \"DJ Got Us Falling In Love (Polow Da Don), \"Hot Tottie\" features contributions from Esther Dean and Jay-Z, the latter adding lines like \"Big ballin' is my hobby, so much they think I'm down with the Illuminati\" -- \"my watch do illuminate, my pockets are Gottie but, I'm God ya'll better ask somebody\".Picking up where he left off on \"Love Em All\" Usher goes beyond \"I'm so cold, you're the hot tottie,\" singing \"I'm a wild boy, you tryin' to tame me baby -- claiming you're a bad bit*h, show me baby\" on \"Hot Tottie.\" One of his best singles to date, comparable to the equally daring \"Lil Freak\" (feat. Nicki Minaj), Usher is at his best on the chorus singing \"I'm like ooh kimosabe, your body is my hobby, we freakin', this ain't cheating, as long as we tell nobody. Tell your girls you leaving, I'll meet you in the lobby.. I`m so cold that I need a Hot Tottie\".Taking a break from the club, Usher slows it down on \"Lay You Down.\" Produced by Rico Love, also behind \"There Goes My Baby,\" \"Lay You Down\" is not Usher's best but nonetheless is a solid effort with him utilizing his falsetto singing \"This ain't bump and grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down\".The remainder of \"Versus\" includes previously released singles \"Somebody To Love (Remix) with Justin Bieber and the June/July 2010 hit \"There Goes My Baby\".  While Usher does a solid job on the last song, \"Stranger,\" a song produced by Drumma Boy with words like \"Sorry you put your trust in strangers and they let you down and I'll be knocking till you let me in -- I want the title of your closest friend, I no longer want to be a stranger,\" the other two songs \"Lingerie\" and \"Get In My Car\" can be bypassed unless you're a freak for sexy lingerie or interested in hearing a long rap from Bun B and Usher stating \"there's too many women in here to waste all my time on you -- what you going to do?\" -- \"You tuggin' my front, I'm squeezing your butt.\"Overall, \"Versus\" is a solid effort worth a buy, or at least a (legal) download or two, after the success of \"Raymond Vs. Raymond\" and its diverse singles, including \"Lil Freak\" and \"Papers\". Afterall, Usher seems to wrap up this successful era on \"Versus,\" letting it be known \"If you not going to finish, don't start no stuff\" (\"Get In My Car\").If you must download, the stand outs are \"Love Em All,\" \"Hot Tottie,' \"DJ Got Us Falling In Love,\" \"Stranger\" and \"Lay You Down,\" that is if you've already downloaded or have \"There Goes My Baby\" on \"Raymond V. Raymond\".\n", "val": 0.00026775297010317445}

Along with the sensual ballad \"There goes my baby\" (originally from Raymond VS Raymond\") and a remix of Justin Bieber's rather cheesy upbeat Dance/Pop \"Somebody to love\", there are 7 new songs.Leading the new songs is Usher's current US top 10 hit \"DJ got us falling in love\", a Techno-ish Dance number (with a perfunctory rap by Pitbull) in the vein of his recent US & UK #1 \"OMG\". Other standouts are \"Hot tottie\" which features Jay-Z and is skeletal with a booming bassline, \"Lingerie\" which is an upbeat Michael Jackson-channeling R&B number produced by Jam & Lewis, and the ballad \"Stranger\" with swirling synths which is similar to songs like \"Burn\" or \"Moving mountains\".The other 3 songs are rather throwaway though, which is a shame as it seems just as he is stepping out of his comfort zone and trying something new, he rushes back to the safety of bland generic R&B sounds. 3 and a half stars.\n", "val": 0.00025786535115912557}

{"text": "Since he disappeared due to marriage, I know a lot of his fans have wondered if he could pull off another \"comeback.\" It seems to me as though the more Usher disappears, the more he is loved when he comes back into the music industry! Thats what I respect about this man! Too many artists have the misconception that they have to be any and everywhere all all waking hours (i.e. media, videos, parties, magazines, commercials, new products, etc). In all actuality, that is how people become bored with you and tired of seeing your face. Every few years or so, Usher will disappear and we won't hear anything new from him for a year or two, but to be honest, thats what makes us (as listeners) crave his music even more! Raymond Vs. Raymond was okay, but in my opinion, Versus is sooooo much better. I must admit that it disappoints me to see so many R&B artists steadily migrating to pop because not too many artists can pull it off, but surprisingly enough, Usher has the versatility to be both! On \"Versus,\" I felt as if he wanted to show the world he can crossover to \"pop\" at anytime he wants to. My favorite tracks on the album are:\"Love Em All\"\"DJ Got Us Falling In Love\"\"Hot Toddy\"\"Lay You Down\"\"Lingerie\"\"There Goes My Baby\" (even though the radio has OBLITERATED any of my interest in the song now---overkill of the song)\"Get In My Car\"\"Somebody To Love\"\"Stranger\"I do not consider myself a fan of Usher, but I do enjoy his music. Over the years, I feel as though Usher has developed an egotistical persona about him, but not to the point where he has abandoned his idea of what music should be. Honestly, the only disappointment was the fact that his album was extremely short. I feel as though Usher should have had a few more tracks on this album, but overall...it wasn't bad at all!

Love 'Em All -- A real cool track that starts Usher on the right foot. He is basically just saying there are too many women available, so he's gonna love them all. B-2. DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love (Feat. Pitbull) -- Not a bad dance R&B cut. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about this song, but it really isn't bad. I'm sure after you hear it too many times, it will get annoying but it's really not bad. Pitbull's part is OK. Something you can definitely dance to. C+3. Hot Tottie (Feat. Jay-Z) -- The beat isn't bad on this track. However, you would think the track would be better considering it's with 2 of the game's hottest superstars right now. Jay-Z's verse is pretty good though. B-4. Lay You Down -- Finally. A slower jam. I usually like Usher's downtempos because they end up being a bit sensual. 'Can U Handle It' is still his best slow song, in my opinion (out of all of his catalog. Yes, I said it!). This one isn't bad. It's just not as good as that song. Not even as good as 'Seduction'. I like the piano though. C5. Lingerie -- This song is a freaky one. However, it's also kind of filler. Not much to say. The beat ain't that great and that's what Usher is about these days so... C-6. There Goes My Baby -- I'm getting tired of this song. However, as a whole, it's not bad, especially considering it's a radio song. It's just played out by now. If you didn't realize, it was also on his album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Raymond-v-Raymond/dp/B002RAREAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Raymond v. Raymond</a>&nbsp;and served as the 4th (and final?) single. C+7. Get In My Car (Feat. Bun B) -- The beat is kinda lazy on this effort, but this song ends up not being bad. There's something about it. It feels like a marching band of some sorts. Usher's lyrics on this are similar to what the subject on 'Love 'Em All' is. Just not as good a song. C8. Somebody To Love (Remix) (Feat. Justin Bieber) -- This song is a bit out of place, lyrically. The beat fits in with the likes of 'DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love' but the words to the song are about being faithful and wanting someone to love instead of flirting and getting your freak on with. Justin only has one verse and sort of gets put in the background towards the end so his part feels tacked on when it's originally his song. So that was kinda crappy. But all in all, this is one of the better songs on the album along with 'Love 'Em All' and 'Hot Tottie'. B-9. Strangers Come -- He saved the last track to be totally serious. And it's a good song. It's about trying to get a girl that has been hurt and doesn't take any of his advances. Usher doesn't give up either. C+This EP was totally worth checking out even though I think Usher hasn't been putting his all in his projects since 2004's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Confessions/dp/B0002ZYDKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Confessions</a>.

Not to mention, even if you don't believe in Global Warming, the song is meant to bring to your attention what we as a society do to the planet that we live on! Think about that, or in the words of Disturbed \"The time bomb is ticking and no one is listening\".

{"text": "In WINTER'S BONE, the young people play today's country and album-oriented rock. The old, traditional tunes are performed primarily by and for the elders of the community as a nostalgic lament for days gone by when residents of the Ozark hill country may not have been living high on the hog, but were content, faith-based, independent, self-sufficient and could earn an honest living without corporate fat cats meddling in their local economies; and where 'white lightning was still the greatest thrill of all' (to quote Merle Haggard). I was born in southwest Iowa in the late 40s. In WINTER'S BONE, seeing and hearing Meredeth Sisco sing the 'Missouri Waltz' a capella resurrected sweet memories of my early childhood when Mom sang this song to me at bedtime. Today, I live in northwest Arkansas (which is also Ozarks) and take occasional trips into backwoods territory. I love the people I encounter there. Tough as a spiny cactus on the outside but, for the most part, tender and sweet on the inside. As for WINTER'S BONE, this simple, suspenseful but also heartwarming motion picture is a fairly accurate portrayal of the hill folk but WINTER'S BONE is also a profound social commentary on our nation's technologically-advanced but morally-and-spiritually challenged character, not just in the Ozarks but in urban areas as well.

{"text": "With all the shlock (is that a word?!)coming out of female-fronted bands of the \"Metal\" genre these days (the latest crap by Lacuna Coil comes foremost to mind) it is refreshing to hear some quality sounds from Tristania.We all know that Vibeke is gone.  And along with her an ethereal voice of astounding range.Enter Mariangela.  Although she does not have near the range of Vibeke she can still belt it out with the best of them.It would be a huge mistake to compare Rubicon with any of Tristania's earlier recordings.  Rubicon stands out by itself.  And admirably so.My favorites are 'Year of the Rat', 'The Passing' and 'Amnesia'.An excellent release by the updated line up of Tristania.\n", "val": 0.019302599132061005}
{"text": "There seems to be a fair bit of resistance to Mariangela, Tristania's new female vocalist (replacing Vibeke).  While I can understand that, having been a fan of Tristania since I first heard \"Beyond the Veil\", I have to say I'm already easing into Mariangela's camp.  While Vibeke's voice was more ethereal (and better suited to the early material), Mariangela's is more personable, with more force of character; in short, less clinical.  I have no problem with the new vocals, and was pleased to see from the liner notes that Mariangela has already thrown herself into the songwriting itself.With that out of the way, if you haven't been following Tristania's long evolution, this album will come as a shock to you.  \"Rubicon\" is not nearly as heavy as some previous endeavours, nor as haunting.  It's much more straightforward, with a couple songs barely over three minutes long, so you could forgiven for mistaking some of the tracks on \"Rubicon\" for a number of female-fronted \"gothic metal\" bands.  With that mild disappointment aside, I still feel there are some strong tracks on display here from the opener \"Year of the Rat\" to the punchier \"Patriot Games\", \"Magical Fix\", and  \"The Emerald Piper\" (challenge: try not to cringe at the line \"you act just like a dumdum boy\") to the brooding eight minute finale, \"Illumination\" (a track you'd think was better suited to their album \"Illumination\", but hey, what do I know?  I guess we can expect the song \"Rubicon\" on the next album).So: not nearly the strongest Tristania album, but still very enjoyable; alternately rousing and easy to drift to.  I look forward to see what this \"new\" Tristania can do once the lineup settles down a bit (male vocalist Osten Bergoy has also quit the band).I'd actually give this 3 1/2 stars rather than four, just because there's definitely a fair bit of filler here. But hey, Amazon doesn't allow that, so I'll be generous.\n", "val": 0.006727500353008509}
{"text": "I've been a fan of Tristania for about 10 years. Their music has been my favorite in the realm of goth/metal. After the release of their album \"Illumination\" I read about Vibeke Stene leaving the band to pursue her teaching. In my eyes (and through my ears) she was Tristania to me. Her voice wasn't something that could be replaced and I was greatly saddened by this news, although I do wish her the best in her future endevors. I later read that Mariangela Demurtas joined the band as the lead female singer. I decided to give her a chance and see what she could bring to the table...I'm amazed.Rubicon is quite a bit different than any of Tristania's previous albums. It's not a bad thing, it's just a different thing. A few of the band members have changed and the overall sound is a bit lighter than usual. Don't begin listening to this album expecting the heavy tunes and deep metal voices of previous albums. If you come in with an open mind and give Mariangela a chance to show you what she can do I'm sure you'll be as impressed as I am.The album opens with, what I believe, is the best example on the album of what the new line up can do. \"Year of the Rat\" gives us a great introduction to Mariangela's voice and the tune the band is looking to give you.I strongly urge you to put on some headphones, close your eyes and let Tristania tell you a story of a magical battle between good and evil, man versus gods and demons, choice and consequence.\n", "val": 0.022344578057527542}

{"text": "This was an album that I was really looking forward to getting my hands on this year.  With the great voice of Michael Kiske teamed up with a very competent female vocalist, plus band members Magnus Karlsson (Allen/Lande, Primal Fear) and Matt Sinner (Primal Fear, Sinner) on guitar and bass, it was an album that promised much.  The songs have been written for the most part by Karlsson and Sinner and consist of a mixture of melodic metal, hard rock and some lighter rock leaning more towards AOR, and whilst nothing ground breaking they are extremely melodic & catchy.  Sinner and Karlsson have both been around for a while now and have found the winning formula in terms of song writing with their other bands and projects, and as you would expect their playing is first class.  There are some great solos on offer here from Karlsson and Sinner provides some pounding bass rhythm throughout the album, which has been produced to perfection.  Each instrument sounds full and rich, yet clear and don't overpower the vocals, because after all the dual vocals are the whole point of this album.  As far as the vocalists go, both complement each other very well and in contrast to Karlsson's Allen/Lande project there are no songs on this album sung by only one of the vocalists.  Each share parts of all of them, but some obviously have one or the other as the primary vocalist.  Amanda Somerville is very pleasant on the ear, singing in a very melodic way with no operatics.I think the album starts off with a bit of a fizzle though with Nothing Left To Say which musically is great, and both vocalists also sound great, but the song just seems to fail to have enough energy with it in terms of the pace of the vocals to be a winning opening punch in my opinion.  Track 2 is the single Silence and I think it also suffers from the same fate.  In fact, whilst I can't fault the performance or production, the melody or the hooks, in terms of the pace of the vocals over the entire album they hardly ever shift out of second gear.  Almost all the songs are sung at the same pace, that being medium.  I say almost because there are some ballads where you expect a slower pace, and track 5 End Of The Road is a fine example of a great ballad, as are track 7 A Thousand Suns, track 9 One Night Burning and track 11 the more AOR oriented Second Chance.Kiske does get going a little bit more in tracks 6 Don't Walk Away and 10 Devil In Her Heart which are two of my favorites with the former sounding more like the stuff he did with Place Vendome, but for my mind I would have liked him to unleash a lot more as he is no doubt capable of doing.  (If you have heard the songs Cross The Line and Streets Of Fire from the Place Vendome albums you will know what I mean.  That is how Kiske should sing more often).  The last half of the album is better than the first, and in general the music on this album does have a harder edge and bit more bite to it than the music on both Place Vendome albums.  But I wouldn't really say that it is better.  Just as good but different would probably best describe how I feel about it.  But I did expect it to be a better album than what it is, which is quite strange really when I can't really find much wrong with it except for the pace of the vocals.  Certainly though it is not as good as either of the Allen/Lande albums released to date.  I think in terms of being a quality recording it is certainly right up there but ultimately I just don't find it to be fully satisfying and therefore can't give it a 5 star rating.\n", "val": 0.0009069302468560636}
{"text": "`Frontiers records' has come up with some rather original ideas for melodic albums but this one is really genius. `Kiske - Sommerville', as the title suggests and most are already aware, is a melodic hard rock/metal album based on vocals duets of legendary German vocalist Michael Kiske and female vocal authority Amanda Somerville.I suppose there is not much reason to go into details regarding the abilities and approaches of the two singers as they are both metal idols at their own right while their contribution on this album has been very much explored by other reviewers. With that in mind I would like to stand on the other factors (beyond Michael and Amanda) that make this album such a musical success and for that matter are just as important as the names on the front cover.A key success factor was bringing to the project possibly the most capable songwriting core of `Frontiers records' that of bassist Mat Sinner and guitarist Magnus Karlsson. Both have been known for delivering amazing melodic works in the genres of melodic AOR, hard rock and metal; and the collaboration of the seasoned Mat with the younger Magnus ideally balances old school and modern influences on the album. The album features additional songwriting by Keyboard player Jimmy Kresic and Amanda, the material they come up with is more mid tempo and symphonic/orchestra-oriented. So closing the songwriting part, the listener does enjoy a variety of rock and metal styles throughout `Kiske/Somerville' while all songs are consistent in big melodies and stellar production.In terms of performing line-up the project finds Matt Sinner on bass guitar, Magnus Karlsson on lead guitar, Sander Gommans also on lead guitar, Jimmy Kresic on keyboards while drum duties are divided between Ramy Ali and Martin Schmidt.Instrument-wise this project continues to surprise as Sinner's bass is louder and more aggressive than one would expect, Magnus' solos are instantly recognizable and never compromised in their length, while the drumming is far more intense than anyone would have anticipated, referring not only to the double bass attack but to the very technical stick work that is to be found throughout the album.Yes, \"Kiske-Somerville\" does capture the best of Michael Kiske and Amanda Somerville still it goes on to offer the listener much more that simply an all star project. It is impossible to find any fault on this album:1)The concept is original 2) The songwriting is diverse yet consistently melodic 3) the singers live up to their reputation while uncovering much more of their vocal abilities than expected 4) the performance on instruments unforgettable and 5) it is all topped by possibly the greatest production ever.The limited edition features a 12th bonus track `Set Afire' and a DVD with the two breathtaking promo videos for `If I had a wish' and `Silence'.\n", "val": 0.01662398874759674}

The band does not take a back seat to the two singers, they are there to play, and play hard.All in all, its a great album to listen in every facet.\n", "val": 0.022589165717363358}
{"text": "The \"Kiske / Somerville\" project was promoted as being the melodic metal debut album of the year. While not exactly true, this is an enjoyable duet album with a lot of hooks, exceptional vocal performances and several outstanding songs.The idea of bringing Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween, Place Vendome, Unisonic) and Amanda Somerville (Aina, Avantasia) together to form this project was conceived by the president of the record label Frontiers Records. The songwriting was assigned mainly to Mat Sinner (Primal Fear) and Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear, Allen/Lande), with further input from Sander Gommans (After Forever), Jimmy Kresic and Amanda Somerville.The self titled debut album finds the two vocalists dueling with one another and singing together in unison, in a diverse sounding project. The music includes melodic rock tracks, melodic metal numbers, ballads, AOR moments, along with some symphonic touches as well.Just to get things out of the way, the vocals throughout the album sound amazing, with great trade off lead passages as well as harmonized choruses. Both Kiske and Somerville give their best, delivering diverse vocal performances and working with one another as if they had sang together for years. While neither singer tries to overshadow the other, or to display his/her full range, they still manage to individually shine throughout. The instrumental portion of the album is also solid and filled with memorable guitar riffs, wonderful solos, orchestrations and great drumming by the numerous participants.Highlights of the album include Silence, Arise, End Of The Road, Devil In Her Heart, If I Had A Wish, Don't Walk Away and Set A Fire.The single \"Silence\" is a melodic power ballad with some of the most memorable vocal performances on the album. Violin backing, keyboards, guitar riffs and energetic drumming provide the backbone for both Kiske and Somerville to interchange both emotional lead vocals and harmonized choruses as well. The addition of orchestral moments together with some keyboard soloing gives us one of the stand out songs on offer.\"Arise\" is a groovy hard rock number. The song includes impressive guitar riffs, squeals ala Zakk Wylde, nice bass lines, soft verses, a fitting guitar solo and an infectious chorus, carried mostly by Somerville and finished in a higher pitched mode by Kiske. This is one of the heaviest, more up-beat and more memorable moments of the album.\"End Of The Road\" is a symphonic ballad done in a magnificent way. Emotional vocals, orchestral parts, some heavier outbursts and an addictive chorus provide the recipe for one of the best tracks on the album.\"If I Had A Wish\" is a strong melodic metal track and another stand out song. It starts with a melodic intro and continues with catchy guitar riffs, impressive drumming, nice guitar solos and exceptionally well sang verses (but suffers a little from a somewhat uninspired chorus).\"Devil In Her Heart\" includes a bombastic arrangement, a catchy double chorus, memorable guitar/keyboard solos, along with a lot of vocal transitions and trade offs. A very well done melodic rock song, which brings to mind the most impressive duets of Meta Loaf.\"Don't Walk Away\" is an up-beat AOR track, which resembles the happier moments of Kiske's Place Vendome project. An uplifting tempo, Kiske's flawless higher range vocals, a catchy chorus, a simple but fitting guitar solo and you've got another good track.\"Set A Fire\" is the heaviest song on offer and closes the album in a powerful way. The track is characterized by heavy guitar riffs, emotionally sang verses by Amanda, fitting backing vocals by Michael and a heavy chorus with high notes by both vocalists.\"A Thousand Suns\" features Amanda on the vocal lead and it is her shining moment. Melodic guitar leads, emotionally driven verses and an outstanding harmonized chorus, provide the elements for a good but not great power ballad.\"Second Chance\" is your standard mellower ballad. While nothing spectacular, the song is emotional, includes deeper lower range vocals and is a memorable offering.The down side of the album are some weaker tracks, one of which seems rather strange as it conveys a mixed feeling of trying to be both a little heavy and mainstream at the same time. The inclusion of some generic choruses, doesn't help the weaker tracks either.Fans of Michael Kiske, Amanda Somerville and Place Vendome will surely love this effort. Fans of Mat Sinner's and Magnus Karlsson's songwriting will also enjoy most of the songs. Hard core metal fans will probably like 2 or 3 songs and hate the rest. The majority of the album features truly great tracks, excellent musicianship and amazing vocal performances.(This particular edition comes together with a bonus DVD.

Despite the song's absence, there is a lot to like here. All the songs have a decent soulful feel to them as only Skinner can deliver, but they suffer form not quite sounding like they were written for Skinner himself. If Skinner gets a second album, and I hope he does, his record producers would do well to match his vocal talents with a song writer who is better suited to his flavor.

What really gets me about this CD is that Talib is so skilled, HE is the one that made me REALLY listen to the CD from a lyrical perspective and NOT by how smokin' the beat is.  Once you do that, this CD is ridiculously good.  From Just Begun, to Back Again, to The Ballad of Black Gold to City Playgrounds, Talib delivers \"knowledge\" and \"perspective\" that makes this 5 stars in the intelligent Hip-Hop scene that we should ALL pay attention to.  The only reason why I wouldn't give this CD 5 stars is because I wanted the beats to be better.  But, all in all this is worth the money, not the bootleg.\n", "val": 0.04391860589385033}

As a deep rooted fan of hip-hop especially during the Rawkus Records movement, I've seen Talib and Tek grow, and mature their styles before my eyes. the first Reflection Eternal is merely a prelude to what they have created here. This is music for your soul, and it speaks directly to that part of you that attaches itself to sounds and rhymthms and rests there. This album is not a recording but a reminder. To those of us who thought that when all hope was lost and we had mis-placed hip hop to drugs, weapons, sexual promiscuity, etc. We have two men who transcended beyond the confines of the common, and expand their sound.  I write this as I listen to the Outro. With a million and one thoughts trampling through my mind, and the song thumping out of my Skull-Candy headphones.

{"text": "I'm glad I got this cd. Damn this cd is a classic.  17 songs and they all sound different and good and are in depth with lyrics and beats that sound creative.  I'm not going to give a song by song.  Instead, I'll say Kweli's lyrics have been pretty good to me always but his delivery, hooks, voice, and beat selection bothered me too much to pick up most of his cd's, even though i did hear them. This cd is different than his last efforts.  This one, is his best or at least next to the last Reflection Eternal.  This cd is not commercial. Talking about oil spills, revolution, naming names of unknown or unpopular revolutionaries, and intricate storytelling, rhyme schemes used and this vocabulary is not commercial. I wish commercial artists did sound this good. Commercial artists I thought were about rapping songs where noone could be offended and only saying what is popular to say in society today or rappers scared to make a statement against the status quo and writing lyrics with no depth of thought to fully expand on a point beyond just an analogy or simile, cliche or quote.  I thought commercial was to not challenge the listener.  This album is great and if his name wasn't Talib it would probably go platinum like Lupe's next cd will.  No knock at all on Lupe, I'm just saying when you've been in the game this long and people think they know who you are and your sound (like Talib), and then your sound sounds rejuvenated, people like me can slip up and miss it cause we wrote you off and categorized you as that dude who has nice lyrics whose subject matter repeats itself, flow is weak, and has that nasal voice and is old.  It's rare as rare can get to hear an old rapper with as many cd's as he has come back this strong with this many different styles.  It's like Hi-Tek breathed all the ingredients he'd been missing into em'.  I didn't expect it.  Straight up to Kweli, put all your money on promoting this cd.  Don't think about the future. I wouldn't wait to promote the next one cause I've heard his stuff and unless he sticks with Hi-Tek I don't know if he'll ever do a cd better than this one. So bottom line if you've been like me who likes two or 3 songs off each of his past 6 cd's but no more, then just know that this cd is different and artistic and I liked all of it.

{"text": "After a decade apart, Talib Kweli and producer Hi-Tek- collectively known as Reflection Eternal- return with a new album, the aptly titled \"Revolutions Per Minute\". This new album is a sharp left turn from its predecessor, their 2000 debut \"Train Of Thought\". On this project, it's decidedly more commercial which can be attributed to them being on the major label Warner Bros. Records. The album starts off with the rather slow \"City Playgrounds\" which would have been better suited for being in the middle of the album. \"Back Again\" features the long absent RES sounding noticeably different. Both tracks \"In This World\" and \"Long Hot Summer\" feature background vocals from Belinda Lipscomb, lead singer of the 1980's funk band Midnight Star. \"Got Work\" is a song in which fame is likened to a drug addiction, while \"Ballad Of The Black Gold\" addresses the controversy and conflict over the ever-present oil crisis. The song \"Lifting Off\" is, by all accounts, a weed song complete with an equally smoky sonic backdrop.Talib handles primarily most of the lead vocals with the exception of the song \"So Good\" which is the lone track in which Hi-Tek actually performs on. The album's best song \"Strangers (Paranoid)\" shows Talib Kweli getting upstaged by Bun B of UGK. There are a few setbacks on \"Revolutions Per Minute\". The songs \"Get Loose\" with Chester French and the Estelle assisted \"Midnight Hour\" are just plain mediocre, while \"In The Red\" suffers from rather mundane production. Overall, Reflection Eternal crafted a good album, but it's a little too radio friendly- even for them.\n", "val": 0.0001642031711526215}
{"text": "Can you really say that everything that Talib Kweli has his name on is a classic? Well we all did when he came out with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Black-Star/dp/B000067CLT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Black Star</a>&nbsp;with Mos Def, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Reflection-Eternal-Train-of-Thought/dp/B000067CLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Reflection Eternal/Train of Thought</a>&nbsp;with Hi-Tek. Yes in a time of crisis when hip-hop is under construction (as most would say if not worse) this album would be. Fortunately here most of everything here is on point. Talib's strong lyrical perfomance and Hi-Tek's great production here in 2010, and signed to a major record label WB (and loosing most, if not all the artists on your roster: Jean Grae, Strong Arm Steady, etc.) could you expect anything less?To start with the bad first, unfortunately, Revolutions Per Minute (RPM), is nowhere near as good as the first Kweli and Ti-Tek colab. Not to say it's bad, but when you set the bar so high for fans, it's easy to make a less quality follow up together. Some of Hi-Tek's production sounds empty, and some songs have not so good hooks. For example \"Back Again\" with RES (where she been?) doesn't sound right with her vocals. \"In The Red\" and \"Long Hot Summer\" both suffers from forgettable production from Hi-Tek. On the latter song, even Talib sound weak.The good about this album are songs like \"Lifting Off\", the catchy \"Get Loose\" with Chester French, and the classic appearances from Mos Def, Jay Electronica, and J. Cole on \"Just Begun\". The latter song is certified classic material. Other notable songs on this album are \"Ends\" with Bilial, and \"My Life (Outro)\". Songs not mentioned are neither good or bad, but were not really worth noting.Sure we can all say that the bar for these two were set a decade ago, and to follow up with that is very hard, but that is like that with most artists. RPM is definately refreshing material from these two and I'm glad that it was finally put out to fans after such a long wait. If anything, I don't want to wait another 10 years for another colab from these two (even though they've made so many songs together on seprate albums). This one is greatly recommended, but my warning is not to approach it with high expectations. Peace.Lyrics: B+Production: B+Guest Appearances: AMusical Vibes: A-Top 5 Tracks:1.

{"text": "So... you don't know Talib Kweli? You've never heard of Hi-Tek? Well thanks to the dynamic duo, hip hop will still be in good hands if Soulja Boy makes platinum on his next album. The Ballad of Black Gold, Just Begun, are just two tracks that bring a sense old school hip hop, and new style blended. Midnight Hour featuring Estelle blends hip hop and 1950's style music to bring a very good track to the album. This album is unique is more politics and current events than the last collaboration. In This World is more brutally honest song, but never the less; it shouldn't be ignored. Lifting Off more of a soft sound, but still never losing it's theme to the album. Strangers(Paranoid) featuring Bun B is the one of the more popular songs on the album, which very well clarify the theme to this album. If your only going to buy one song off this album, make sure its Strangers(Paranoid). Any new comers to this collaboration, it's not disappointing. Any known associates, buy it.\n", "val": 0.029525281861424446}
{"text": "It is Talib & Hi Tek at their finest. Well overdue in the midst of all this same song, cookie cutter artists.May not be as deep as the first Reflection Eternal (classic IMHO) but it is up to par with it as far as lyrics go.This is the equivalent of that in the times we are in though.

{"text": "Reflection Eternal are a duo comprising rapper Talib Kweli and DJ/producer Hi-Tek, and \"Revolutions per minute\" is the follow-up to their 2000 debut \"Train of thought\". Refreshing lyrics combined eclectic sounds making for one of the best releases this year.The sunny \"Back again\" features the breezy vocals of Res singing the chorus. \"Strangers (Paranoid)\" is Dub with a triumphant horn section and features Bun B. The bouncy Doo Wop-style \"Midnight hour\" featuring Estelle and the similarly bouncy \"Get loose\" featuring Chester French will get you moving on the dancefloor.  \"Lifting off\" is languid Jazz/Funk-inflected as is \"Just begun\" featuring Jay Electronica, J Cole and Mos Def.Some lyrics touch on real deep issues. The glitchy spartan \"In the red\" finds Kweli rapping \"Shame how our heroes is broke/We call them stars/It's because when they falling to Earth/They falling hard.\" as he talks about his music heroes Michael Jackson and James Brown working till their last day as they were broke.\"Ballad of the black gold\" talks about exploitation by oil companies and governments, using Nigeria as an example and mentioning the attack on the Ogoni people, the killing of Saro Wiwa, and the resulting militant's kidnapping of oil company workers. \"Never see, happy hungry people that ain't rational, They blastin through the gates and they attack you at the capitol, Run up in your palace, find the heads of state and crack a fewGet a taste of power then, they become fascists too, The fiscal, conservatives, don't know what they purpose is, Put money on the war then they cut your goods and servicesMurderous corporate monsters is breakin records, Exxon is at 40 billion a year, they rakin in record profits - stop it! How they bankin while the auto industry is tankin? Leadership is sankin, oil pollution in the water stankin, Loyalty, to petroleum royalty spoil the economy, We won't get it poppin 'til we oil free, If you're oil rich then we invadin, They call occupation but we losin jobs across the nationDrill baby drill while they make our soldiers kill baby still The desert where the blood and oil spill...\" Pretty apt these days, especially with the BP oil spill imbroglio.The soulful \"Ends\" features Bilal, while closing cut \"My life (Outro)\" is sublime with skittery beats.This year has seen incredible releases in Hip Hop by The Roots, Nas & Damian Marley, and Big Boi to mention a few. \"Revolutions per minute\" more than lives up to its name.

{"text": "Maybe because it's all been done before, or because it \"died\" (it didn't, but it might be molding), or maybe because American capitalism has finally swallowed big and small acts alike, no one can deny that hip hop has changed not from \"bad\" to \"worse\" or from old-school to new-school to new-old-school, but to just plain mediocre.  Maybe 808s have just outworn their welcome, maybe someone needs to invent a new piece of beat machinery.  Either way, what was once a common enemy typified by Tribe's Show Business, the almighty machine of Record Company People and their adoption of anything that sells, has left the music somewhere beyond left field (maybe the hot-dog vendor?), in a business routine well beyond any EPMD album title, in some no-man's land of lackluster, sporadic, occasionally-inspired mediocrity.  What seemed so vital, so necessary, so passionate in 1993 feels over-produced, under-produced, or auto-produced in 2010, although one could make the argument it was already beginning when Rawkus nose-dived into a spotty caricature of its former self, if it ever was anything more than a couple of folks in the right place at the right time who could only ride the coattails of luck so long before they learned to love the bomb ride down, Dr. Strangelove style.  It's not that this new one from Hi Tek and Kweli is awful, that would be easy, even preferable.  It's that it fails to move me in the slightest while managing to avoid all of the typical gaffes that at least provide for some moments of sarcastic relief.  Just when the beat in Midnight Hour starts to work its magic, it gets squashed. Just when I start nodding off during Lifting Off, I start ignoring Kweli's chorus of overdubbed punch-ins and start following Hi Tek's bassline, weaving in and out of subtly-plucked strings and tonal undercurrents.  It's that it feels like Kweli and Hi Tek still have something to offer us, still have talent between the ears, still find small moments of solid connection, that its so frustratingly average when all is said and done.  I have a love-hate relationship with Train of Thought, but Kweli has always been a gifted lyricist, and I can even get over dry-cleaning he did to his delivery, trading in that once uniquely divisive, rushed, unpredictable flow for the standard hit-every-quarter-note gravelly tone he puts out these days.  Everybody's entitled to switching up their style, it's not that Kweli changed, or that he changed for the worse, its that he didn't change enough, for better or worse, and I keep hoping some late release by Kweli or Mos will somehow turn in something truly inspired and well-crafted, and unfortunately, Revolutions Per Minute ain't it.  I'd take Memories Live, or even More or Less from Eardum, over just about anything on here.  Ballad of the Black Gold is a decent track, but there's always high hopes for these two, maybe the bar was just set too high so many years ago.  It doesn't knock (come on hi-tek! wtf?), it doesn't take you off into magical lala land, bring you to tears or pour champagne down your earholes...it just..kinda...goes.\n", "val": 2.8352167646517046e-05}

{"text": "Somebody told me that music is cyclical and in time the dance/funk sound of the late 70's and 80's would return.  I just didn't think it would happen to such an extents of perfection. Hot Mess can be considered a \"Classic Song\" and by that I mean it has the capability of withstanding the years.  I spent the peak period of my life during the decade of the late seventies and 80's, my Twenties.  I can attest that it is that period of time that an individuals taste of music becomes embedded within themselves.  Also it should be known that I own well over 2,000 CD's spanning the decades from 50/60's doo-wop, Motown, Teen 60's pop, Beatles, Stones and the other bands that made up the British Invasion, 70's music from the likes of Robin Trower, Disco, Grateful Dead, 10cc Godley Creme, Paul Simon, Carly Simon, Electric Light Orchestra.  Then came what is now know as 80's music at a time when I entered my 20's along with falling in love and eventually married.  The music scene evolved in that decade and is now simply referred to as \"80's music\".  Cars, Duran Duran, Madonna, Pointer Sisters, and a slew of one hit wonders took synch pop and added a dance beat for a decade of happy dance hits.  Stewing in the background like some some plot to kill bubbled RAP, which I refer to as CRAP.  I never understood the derogatory type of music that is vulgar, with a mix of ranting blasphemy and brain washing messages where profanity and hatred towards women, or anybody or thing is the norm.  Although I do like Eminem to some extent.  Other than him.  Rap to me is CRAP and has been removed from my extensive music collection and is avoided like the plague.  I did enjoy some 90's music with the likes of Violent Femmes, 10 thousand maniacs, R.E.M, Toni Braxton, Enigma.  But the decade was not as vast as earlier decades in variety.  To me, it was as if music entered a stage of rapid makeover and decline. Then hit the new millennium. If AIDS killed disco then RAP killed just about all forms of music besides teenage pop like my much hated Britney Spears and whatever DISPOSABLE music these girls nowadays are listening to on their Iphones.  I had pretty much given up hope on every music returning to the upbeat dance music with catchy hooks.  I happened to be researching the return of 80's sound on the internet and came across several groups.  Not liking 80's Glam Rock and Hard Rock, I found Cameo.  I swore the music was straight out of the 80's, yet sounded as if it matured in a very positive way.  I had found a band that made refreshing music that upon listening instantly stands out as different and catches you off guard with eyes wide open followed by and instantaneous purchase of all their music while on the back in excitement thinking \"can this be real\".  It is.  I just hope they don't run out of juice too soon because they have breathed new life into new music.  Keep at it Chromeo!\n", "val": 4.738789357361384e-05}

{"text": "I discovered Chromeo on Daryl Hall's web series \"Live From Daryl's House.\" When I saw them perform songs like \"Waiting For You\" I knew these guys were something special. Their music has clearly been influenced by Hall & Oates, among other 80s pop musicians. Their last album - Fancy Footwork - was flat out awesome! So, I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of \"Business Casual.\" I've been listening to it all day, and here is what I think of it.\"Business Casual\" is a very solid album. It has many incredibly catchy songs like \"Night By Night\" - the BEST song on the album! \"I'm Not Contagious,\" \"When The Night Falls\" and \"Don't Walk Away\" are all amazing songs as well. Almost every song on here is excellent. I don't think it topped \"Fancy Footwork,\" but \"Business Casual\" is more of the Chromeo I've grown to love. It did not disappoint.One thing I really like about Chromeo is that they truly care about the music they create. If you listen to their songs multiple times, you'll pick up on different instruments you didn't notice before. That's because they spend a great amount of time adding multiple layers of incredibly effective music. If you your hips or lips don't start moving by the time this album is over, you might want to check your pulse because you're probably dead;)\n", "val": 0.035553839057683945}

{"text": "Chromeo are electro-Funk duo Patrick \"P-Thugg\" Gemayel and David \"Dave 1\" Macklovitch from Canada, and their retro sound is redolent of eighties bands like Zapp, Hall & Oates or Cameo, not to mention that David's vocals recall Ray Parker Junior.The songs are bouncy catchy fun; the falsetto-sung \"Hot mess\" with great drum breaks, \"I'm not contagious\" sounding like Zapp (thanks to P-Thugg's vocoder sounds), while the galloping \"Night by night\" is groovy with a great guitar solo. \"Don't turn the lights on\" features a choppy and slippery bassline, while the epic 7 minute long \"You make it rough\" is Prince-meets-LCD Soundsystem with its lengthy electronic-laden breaks.The light Funky \"When the night falls\" is enhanced by Solange's vocals in the chorus. Highlight has got to be \"Don't walk away\" with an incredible Disco-style string section and lyrics about a changing relationship. \"J'ai claque la Porte\" is a lilting ballad sung in French over delicate electronic beats, spare synths and tenderly picked acoustic guitar.\"The right type\" is 80s Pop while closing Glam/Pop \"Grow up\" reminds one of Adam Ant.

It will send chill bumps down your spine. And that same \"River Deep, Mountain High\" is included on The Concert Of Love CD. Buy this CD.

Darlene continues to leave us in awe with her impeccable timing and flawless ability to make each and every song her own.  With a mix of some of her best hits from the 50's and 60's along with some amazing new ones, there is also Darlene's show stopping, standing ovation performance from her memorable role as Motormouth Mable (sorry I am not good with names...I could never forget the performance which I saw 8 times, but might have be a little off as far as her name in the play)in the Broadway play Hairspray in which she wowed audiences during her several year run.  I for one, have been waiting years for the chance to have the once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to watch this classy lady perform night after night right in my own living room.  RUN!!!!!..don't walk to get your own copy of one of the best concerts you will ever see.  Read her autobiography, read the never ending reviews of her performances all over the world and see what all the fuss is about.  My only two problems with this DVD is #1..I have actually already worn my copy out and need to replace it and #2..the taping of the concert was not in my area and I was not able to witness it in person.  But I have been lucky enough to see Darleve live many times and if ever given the opportunity to find her performing in your area don't miss out on seeing her.  I guarantee you will not regret it.  And finally....GO BUY THIS DVD...and experience Darlene in concert for yourself!!!  This is the kind of raw talent that is very hard to find these days.  ENJOY!!!!!!\n", "val": 0.025708496570587158}

{"text": "Darlene Love: Concert of Love. A live solo concert CD by one of America's greatest, under-recognized, singers, finally, as of 2011, voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This is a sassy, spirited, spontaneous performance by Darlene Love, a woman whose voice has been heard on literally hundreds of hits, as she brings down the house with her many audience favorites.  And, before we go any further, let's agree that she's surely no spring chicken these days, but I don't think her voice has lost a bit.Music legend Phil Spector himself hand-picked Love as a singer.  He also suggested she take \"Love\" as a stage name: she says she always mistrusted Spector, we now know with very good cause, so she later legally changed her surname. She was, in fact, born Darlene Wright, a preacher's daughter, and is actually the sister of Betty Wright, who also sings a bit. (Wright is a one hit wonder: she had a monster in \"The Cleanup Woman,\" which, I understand was the first U.S. hit set to a Caribbean beat.)At any rate, Love's  is widely considered the voice that launched a hundred hits. During the 1960's mega girl-group era, she sang backup for artists like Sam Cooke, Elvis Presley, Doris Day, Nat King Cole, Cher, Dionne Warwick, the Righteous Brothers, Tom Jones and many others. She is surely also on some of Spector's greatest hits: every voice on the supposedly Crystals' \"Da Doo Ron Ron\" was hers; as was every voice on any Bobby Sox and the Blue Jeans hit. She played Maybelle Motormouth for three years in the Broadway production of \"Hairspray:\" (Queen Latifah took the part in the film.) Love co-starred with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in all four of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lethal-Weapon-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00000G3PL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lethal Weapon: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;1-4 [Blu-ray] films. She also appeared in the last film made by Elvis Presley,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Change-of-Habit/dp/B00006674X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Change of Habit</a>&nbsp;[DVD] [1969], with Mary Tyler Moore. Love has long been a favorite of American TV personality David Letterman's; she has performed on his Late Night Christmas special since 1986. Her music has also been featured on over 22 movies soundtracks.Some of the songs on this DVD are:Da Doo Ron RonHe's Sure the Boy I LoveHe's a RebelToday I Met the Boy I'm Gonna MarryWait Til My Bobby Gets HomeI Know Where I've Been (from \"Hairspray\")River Deep, Mountain HighShe's a great, longtime favorite of mine, and I've managed to read her autobiography, long out of print, and hard to find, unfortunately:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/My-Name-Is-Love-The-Darlene-Love-Story/dp/0688156576/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Name Is Love: The Darlene Love Story</a>. I've also managed to see her several times. At least twice at New York's late, lamented club, the Bottom Line (a site now absorbed into New York University), doing her Christmas show with Ronnie Spector, another of Spector's great stars, and also a long-time favorite of mine. And at New York's Central Park, in an open-air show with Nona Hendryx. At that show, I found myself standing by the path that had been set aside for the artists to exit, surrounded by autograph hunters. As she passed me by, she gave me a look that us New Yorkers would call, \"so nu, what are you doing standing here without an autograph book?\" Hey, I just wanted to breathe the same air as her for a second.

While previous bandwagon CDs tended to be driven by a concept, this CD is just straight forward playing by the trio.  Bandwagon is made of up Jason Moran on piano, Nasheet Waits on drums, and Tarus Mateen on bass.  In my opinion Jason is the top jazz pianist playing today.  Of course there are many other pianists equally deserving this title, but for my taste Jason is the best.  His technical ability is phenomenal.  He can solo equally well with both hands, and can solo with both hands at the same time.  He has his own distinct style and personality which you can hear not only in his compositions, but also, in his arrangements of standards.  His style is modern sounding, primarily post bop, but with a touch of free jazz, and avante garde.  From both his playing style and compositions you can tell he is a deep thinker.This is my favorite Jason Moran CD to date.  The CD features 6 songs written by Moran, 1 co-written by Moran and Andrew Hill, 1 by bassist Mateen, 1 by Thelonious Monk, 1 by Leonard Bernstein, 1 by Jaki Byard (a former teacher of Moran), and 2 versions of a song written by Conlon Nancarrow.  The CD has a good mix of up tempo songs, and ballads.  The only area I see for improvement would be to write some bigger parts for drummer Nasheet Waits.  He plays great throughout the CD, but doesn't really get a chance to show off his skills.  Typically you see more opportunities for the drummer to show off their stuff in a piano/bass/drums format.  Overall a great CD and a must have for fans of the piano/bass/drums format, pianists, and Jason Moran fans.Song Highlights:Gangsterism over 10 years - This song has a raucous Wild West swinging feel to it.  It is more or less the bandwagon theme song.  It features some wild soloing from Moran.  During one flurry he probably hits every key on the keyboard.To Bob Vatel Of Paris - This Jaki Byard song opens with a solo statement by Moran.  The song has a very happy, \"walk in the park\", early 50's bebop sort of mood to it.  After Moran's intro the bass and drums come in with a nice walking bass line.Crepuscule with Nellie - In this Thelonious Monk tune, Jason Moran injects his own personality while still staying true to the original Monk tune.  Mateen has a great bass solo in the middle of the tune, where the song almost turns into a blues vamp for a few bars.  The song starts of very true to the original, then veers off for a little bit, and comes back to the original with a nice recap statement at the end.Blue Blocks - This song starts of with a Sunday morning sort of feel, and picks up pace as it goes along.  At one point there is a section with a barrage of cascading chords that is just wonderful.  The mood again is up-tempo and upbeat.  This is another great new composition from Moran.\n", "val": 0.018110457807779312}

{"text": "I had watched his comedy central special and had to buy his CD because they usually cut out some of the best parts from the half hour special...and they did!  If you've seen him on any of the comedy central roasts, then you know his comedy is hard hitting.  His dead pan style and in your face punch lines make him one of the best comedians working today (in my humble opinion).  He's on par with Steven Wright's style but much more in your face with his punch lines like Daniel Tosh.  He jokes about subjects that people have trouble even talking about, and that's what's appealing to me about Anthony.  He's not fun for the whole family, but he's certainly worth the entertainment buck!\n", "val": 0.021587776020169258}

{"text": "Comedians have been addressing social taboos since the dawn of the profession. George Carlin made a career out of it. The differencce between Carlin and Jeselnik is that Carlin had a personality. He had a soul. Jeselnik just comes up with short, sometimes well worded, jokes that are often offensive and meant to push people's boundaries. That's fine. I can do that. But I don't detect a lot of personality in his material. It would work better if his was a distinct voice. But the most i could tell you about Anthony Jeselnik is he's either actually or at least acts arrogant. Not enough.\n", "val": 6.03682165092323e-05}

{"text": "I wouldn't bother. Mitch Hedberg he's not; Bill Hicks he's not. Every joke is simple classic misdirection -- sometimes it works, most times it doesn't. There are exceptions, however. I liked this one: \"When I misbehaved as a kid, my dad would take off his belt. It scared me to death, because I knew there was no way to stop him .. from shooting heroin.\"Alas, a good deal of the bit is jokes about domestic violence and sex. The material isn't really racist or sexist, but it flirts with these areas. Some of the jokes are as intelligent and clever as the title implies,  but most of it seems designed to appeal to the Steven Lynch crowd.\n", "val": 0.002576608443632722}

Anthony's dead pan delivery of these wry quick jokes that go very dark completely do it for me.

{"text": "I'm a huge Godsmack and Sully Erna fan, so naturally I went out on my lunch break and got his new CD, Avalon. The title alone has much spiritual significance and symbolism that fellow Wiccans/Pagans will immediately understand. It's a fairly quick listen, but packed with soulful, beautiful music that really seems to be his best work to date. As Sully has said, this is quite a departure from typical Godsmack fare. The way he incorporates elements from tribal, folk and even gospel is genius. Most notable songs are Avalon, 7 Years, Sinner's Prayer, My Light and The Departed. My Light has been on repeat for the past few hours and as a parent I love it more each time I listen. It feels like he literally poured his heart and soul into this album. People who love music that has real, significant meaning they can relate to will love this CD. Blessed Be Sully!\n", "val": 0.03431326150894165}

Each song is different and so it doesn't have a chance to get old since it is not repetitive. Much like you have heard, a lot of the album is very tribal and Earthy (the song The Rise has the sound of crows cawing), but everything works and it works very well. My personal favorite song on Avalon is probably \"My Light\". It is the more commercial sounding song of the album but still stays in the theme of the record. \"The Departed\", \"Eyes of a Child\" and \"Cast Out\" are all great too. So many great songs, that overall, Avalon will be in my regular rotation of music that I listen to. I love it and I can tell it will only get better with age.\n", "val": 0.034372903406620026}

{"text": "This is really a great album with a deep spiritual message. It's probably the best stuff he's done in my opinion. I love all the godsmack albums but they lacked that spiritual and contemplative depth. This album has the wisdom of some of the Pearl jam or tool albums which is hard to find. The song structures are different on this one, some 8 minutes long and a lot of tribal sounding instruments and strings are used. It doesn't have as much of the heavy metal sound that godsmack has. I wish godsmack would have evolved in this direction rather that holding on to that old sound, holding on to the shallowness of youth. Sully has a lot of deep thoughts and a humble soul, he's just hidden it from godsmack!\n", "val": 0.007043303456157446}

{"text": "It may sound odd, but, the main reason I purchased the entire album and not individual songs, as I usually do, is that the production quality on this album is AMAZING.  Every song is a pleasure to listen to through headphones - the instruments are all beautifully arranged in the mix and the sound just fills your ears in the most natural, gorgeous way.  A big reason for this, I believe, is the fact that acoustic instruments are used over synthesized and it makes all the difference.  The lyrics are outstanding & I love the somewhat dark & brooding nature of most of the songs.  The drums are out of this world good and every beat is crystal clear without overwhelming the mix - kudos to the producers & engineers who did such an excellent job.  I wish production value were as good on more artist's albums, but sadly, most of it today just stinks.\n", "val": 0.014386999420821667}

When I heard a sample of the music, I rushed out to buy the CD without hesitation but wish I would have heard more beforehand.Sully's vocals are ok on some of the songs but after a while, it just sounds monotonous and boring. I kept listening, hoping there was going to be something to pull me in but I felt left hanging. To me, even the lyrics begin sounding the same from one song to the next. Yes, there are some nice storylines in some of the songs but for the most-part they reminded me of many of his past (lost soul, isolated-self type) writings.Had I known that every song was going to sound almost exactly the same as the one before, I would not have bought this CD. I respect the album for what is but unfortunately, I can only listen to a couple songs at a time before I have to swich to something else. Musically this is 5 STARS.

When I heard about a solo album from Sully, I was fearful to be quite honest in that I was expecting a rehash of Godsmack material (a la Dropbox) and just repackaged to make a buck.  As a loyal fan, I should have known better.  This album is amazing, from the insight Sully provides with the album insert, to the lyrics on tracks like 'My Light\" and \"Eyes of a Child\".  The addition of Lisa Guyer both vocally and musically is a nice touch. The middle eastern influences and tonal qualities are refreshing.The album is by no means a hard rocking jaunt to your ears, rather it is a journey through the mind and emotions of Sully and is a pleasant change from all that is harsh and loud in the world of alternative and hard rock.

Musically and vocally the cd is AWESOME!

Being a fan of Godsmack, especially Sully, I was very much interested in getting my hands on a copy of this album and listening through the whole piece. I was not disappointed at all; every song is beautiful and completely hypnotic, calming me every time I stop to listen to it. The use of drums, cello, and other assorted instruments are amazing, and while I do not pretend to be a music expert, this is totally unique and wonderful. Some people of course, especially those who are searching for the style of the band Godsmack, will not care for it, but even my country-loving mother (who detests rock in almost any form, and would cringe at the sound of Godsmack) thought Sully's voice was haunting and neat (she compared him to Scott Stapp for some reason). All of my friends who tried it loved it, despite being pop fanatics. I highly recommend this CD and strongly believe very few people will dislike it.

I'm glad I checked out the clips and decided to buy it, because this is an absolute gem of a release. \"Avalon\" takes you on a whirlwind of eclectic sounds and eerily smooth vibes. No \"hard rock\" tracks on here; if you're a fan of more mellow Godsmack tracks like \"Serenity\" and \"Voodoo,\" you'll love this album. Sully's lyrics and vocals are meaningful and full of emotion. He's joined on the album by Lisa Guyer, who aptly performs backup vocals on most tracks, and fills the lead singer role beautifully on the thundering track \"The Rise.\"\"Avalon\" genuinely smacked me from out of nowhere and left me wanting more. Although it is relatively short at 10 tracks, every single track fills a purpose and provides a unique aural experience, blending together to provide what might be one of 2010's best albums of any genre. Standout tracks are \"Avalon,\" \"Broken Road,\" \"Sinner's Prayer,\" and \"Eyes Of A Child,\" but there is not one single weak track on the entire album. Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.03156961500644684}
{"text": "Avalon is a great work from an extremely talented man.  If you are buying this album looking for a GODSMACK clone sound you will be disappointed.  That being said, Sully really shines in this album.  It has a strong tribal sense throughout the entire work.  You can feel his power and emotions in every piece.  Sully remarked (and I may be paraphrasing here, its not a direct quote), you should listen to this with the lights out, some candles lit, and some incense burning.  I have to agree and it definitely added to the ambiance.  The biggest difference between Sully's solo work and his great work with Godsmack is the strong presence of the female vocal.  Lisa Guyer (who sang background vocals on The Hollow from IV) has a beautiful, haunting voice that gives great depth to already great songs. She especially shines in The Rise, my only complaint is that Sully is hidden in the background and is almost imperceptible.  Avalon is a strong opener for the album. This is a delicious mix of oriental and tribal rhythms with haunting female vocals.  7 years is the longest track that features female vocals, bass guitars and a nice consistent tribal rhythms. This excellent combination blends perfectly. The song also contains some great electric guitar work merged with cellos.  Broken road is a beautiful piano melody piece complete with a perfect percussion. The song gives me chills and it is one of my favorite.  Sinner's prayer is a great choice for a glimpse of mood for the album. This is a blend warm medium tempo tribal rhythms with eastern influences. The melody remains in your mind when it is over. very enchanting.  My Light features a dominant eastern acoustic guitar complete with flutes and an ambient sweet percussion. The melody is captivating throughout the song.  The Rise is a great combination of african tribal rhythms and cellos with Lisa Guyer's vocals.  Until then is a mixture of piano and cellos highlighted by Sully's vocals, simply gorgeous and sublime. The different parts blend beautifully. Another of my favorite from the album.  The Departed features a sensual atmosphere (because of Sully's vocals) with an acoustic guitar at around 3 :30. It combines eastern ambiance and tribal rhythms. I had the sensation of being in Prince of Persia`s movie.  Eyes of a Child is an excellent combination of flutes, acoustic guitars, modern beats, classical oriental rhythms and cellos. It also contains a nice guitar solo work.  In Through Time is an instrumental piece, very quiet and peaceful. Just beautiful.  Cast out (Spirit Ceremony) ends the album. It is a fantastic track that incorporates aspect of indian culture from tribal rituals.\n", "val": 0.03764159977436066}

{"text": "Granted, 2010 was not the best year for music (or anything else for that matter). But, when I first heard this I was stunned, excited, and most of all I was happy. Sully Erna put in some serious work with this one as you can see from the amazon video. What really surprises me about this record is how much of a departure it is from what he's done with Godsmack. This album is better than any Godsmack album by the way, although I love Godsmack and what they've done over the past 11 years. I can't exaggerate enough how awsome these lyrics are (particularly on 7 Years, Sinner's Prayer). Godsmack, although a very talented band, were always known for their hard hitting sounds rather than deep, resonating lyrics. Sully Erna brings it home on the songwriting front with brilliant compositions and truly heartfelt lyrics. The other musicians he's brought in also do a wonderful job, particularly the female vocalist and the cello player.There's really so much more I could say but then nothing would be left to the imagination. If you're skeptical, listen to \"Avalon\" (song) and see what you think. I'm absolutely serious, best album 2010. It's perfect.\n", "val": 0.016933318227529526}
{"text": "I'll start off my review saying that I didn't even know this was coming out. Last week, I was looking for Godsmack's release from earlier this year, but I stumbled upon Avalon and noticed it had just come out earlier in the week. I previewed the tracks and by the third track's sample, I bought it (on iTunes, but that's another story). I didn't even have to listen to the rest.As it started to download, I had a moment of buyer's remorse. \"What did you just do??? It couldn't be that good.\" By the time the previews had finished, even though I had only heard bits and pieces, I knew my instincts were right on the money.I am a casual Godsmack fan, by no means a fanatic, but I do like them a lot. I don't think liking Godsmack is a requirement to love this one. The style is sufficiently different from Godsmack, while at the same time familiar. I don't agree with the one lukewarm reviewer that only Godsmack fans will enjoy this record. For one thing, this is not a metal record, nor is it hard rock. It's still rock. It's mellower musically... but at the same time, it is sung from the heart and with power.This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Every other review you'll read here (except for one, but hey, there's always someone that doesn't get it) got it right. It is an epic. The songs are textured and rich. The vocals are perfect, and \"Until Then...\" may be one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. This is an outstanding solo effort and I really hope that this one catches on because it would be a tragedy if it didn't. People need to hear this one.\n", "val": 0.022541310638189316}

{"text": "I'm a die hard Godsmack fan.  One thing that has always stood out to me about that band is Sully Erna is a musical genius.  He's quite the lyricist and can play any instrument he gets his hands on.  Very talented and creaticw musician indeed.  Anyone who has ever seen Sully solo or with Godsmack knows he's a perfectionist and puts on a flawless show.  I've greatly been anticipating his solo album. Although I prefer heavier types of music such as Godsmack, I've been mesmerized by the talent displayed in Avalon.  The song \"My Light\" was written for his daughter Skylar.  It brings a tear to the eye.  Such a refreshing thing for a musician to bear his soul to the world today.  My favorite song is \"7 Years,\" but they're all spectacular.

You just have to hear this for yourself cuz I don't know how to explain it. I will vote this album for rock album of the year. NOT 1 song on this album is bad. My fave is \"The Departed\".....but every song is unreal. I can't stop listening to it.I can't say enough about AVALON....it's almost a surreal thing when listening. It sucks you in and you want to replay it over and over. If you have ever been to a VEGAS \"Cirque Du Soliel\" show.....u would think this is a soundtrack to one of there shows.

{"text": "I had read quite a bit about this solo release and how anticipated it was. Having been a Godsmack fan since day 1 and having experienced all of their amazing live performances on DVD, I was really chomping at the bit waiting for the release of \"Avalon\". With this CD Sully has taken everything that makes Godsmack what they are and simply stripped it all bare. Now don't be mistaken , this is not a rock record, far from it in fact. It's the voice but there is just so much more on offer here. The vocal talents of Sully and guest vocalist Lisa Guyer are simply breathtaking, interwoven with the tribal rhythms at play and the amazing cello and percussion courtesy of classically trained cellist Irina Chirkova, and percussionist Niall Gregory of Dead Can Dance. Each song becomes a journey and the entire album is complex musically but very listenable. Apparently Sully has featured some tracks off \"Avalon\" in his solo live performances throughout 2008 and 2009. So, if you like your music broad and have an open mind beyond the realms of rock or metal, this is for you. If you are expecting a downtuned Godsmack record, look elsewhere, but hey, it's still Sully Erna and his amazing voice is worth at least a listen....and no doubt once that happens..... you'll wanna buy \"Avalon\".\n", "val": 0.011696592904627323}

{"text": "I read all these reviews and as much as I respect their individual opinions, I couldn't help but think \"unless you are a fanatical fan, there is no way you could love this entire album\". I could be wrong, but my guess is the only people who will take time to write a review are the people who admire or completely despise Godsmack, so I thought I'd weigh in with a slightly less biased commentary--of course, in the end, who am I to judge another man's work. So I try to avoid \"criticizing\" and I try to just observe and \"comment\", but no one can remain completely unbiased, so please keep that in mind...After hearing The Departed as a bonus track on The Oracle, I lowered my expectations for Avalon, not because the song was bad--it's not. At all. I just don't like Lisa Guyer's vocals, and, unfortunaterly for me, she is ALL OVER this album--in fact, the song The Rise is almost all her. Please realize, if she wasn't on the album so much (or at all), I'd probably rave about it because the music varies from interesting to amazing, and never boring.Many of the songs are slow and very emotional--Broken Road and Until Then... are among the saddest of the lot. Lyrically, some of it is very well written, but other parts border on goofy.  I can't personally comment on Sully's personal ideology, but when the lead singer of the multi-platinum selling Godsmack sings \"resurrect me Jesus Christ\" on Eyes of a Child, I can't help but giggle--the chance that he might be serious when he sings it has me full out laughing. I realize how the line applies to the song (about children dying of AIDS), but still... I, personally, dislike religion in my music, especially when the singer was (and perhaps may still be) a \"devout Wiccan\" (a duo- or polytheistic religion that does not acknowlege the myth of Jesus Christ).I have yet to hear the bonus track Cast Out (Spirit Ceremony), but so far I can say I like a little over one-half of the album (hence the 3 stars). Another reviewer said it nicely when they suggested that Avalon's moodier vibe balances the guitar-heavy Oracle album by Godsmack. I respect Sully's disire to distance his solo career from Godsmack, but I can't help but feel songs like Seven Years and Sinner's Prayer would fit nicely alongside songs like Sinner and Saint, I Blame You, and Shadow of a Soul. At least, that's how I'm setting it up. If I lose The Rise and My Light in the process... well, no love lost.\n", "val": 0.0003940378373954445}

{"text": "Not necessarily being an actual practicer of Wiccan i have always had an interest in it and what attributes it has. Having a large background in Indian heritage i can always say i have had an obsession with forests, water, the earth, and a closeness to nature in general. This album is a brilliant masterpiece of haunting ambient beauty and basically steals your soul and doesnt give it back until the album is over. All the songs are very in depth with much emotion but each one being its own entity. Staring off with Avalon (The Goddess of the Sacred Landscape) you really get the feeling sully puts his heart into it, also with the really great female vocalist he uses, its clear to see why the song is so beautiful and effective. 7 Years being one of the strongest tracks on the record is really a great song in itself, clocking in at just under 9 minutes it has a very powerful and moving vibe to it. I'll study more into what it means but i'm pretty sure it's the death of someone close, he's dealt with for 7 years. Broken Road is a great song very reminiscent of Geoff Tates solo song \"Someone Else\" only without the annoying high range vocals. The song sends chills up your spine and is obviously very personal mentioning Sullies father. Great track. Sinner's Prayer is a great Indian vibed track complete with chants, and orchestra which most songs on here consist of. Sully and the female vocalist(Lisa Guyer) whom i'm not familiar with, really help round out the entire album and as i said every song is great, at first they may seem to sound the same but give it a few listens, and you'll be hooked. I was on the first few listens, but since i only got it yesterday, its still fresh to me, will it stay that way? I'm sure of it.Most albums can take a while to get use to and some if you get hooked to quickly it will get old fast, i found this to be the case with Nevermores-The Obsidian Conspiracy, which i wore out, but still is great. Many people will probably dog the albums Wiccan theme as they do Slayer with there Satanic themes, oh well to each there own. The songs on this are just superb and it puts you in a very relaxed, meditative state in which you won't want to return from. Thats something few albums have, let alone try. The theory of Reincarnation is something i have been interested in all my life, so as i study it i truly love to listen to the songs here, The Departed and The Rise being the ones closest to the subject. So even if your not interested in any of the spiritual type aspects of the album, buy it anyways, you'll be happy to just relax, and take a departure away form the grind, and the usual music we are stuck with. Also yes the name Jesus Christ is mentioned about twice in the record so for all the believers this won't be a problem. You'll especially like the track \"My Light\" if your a fan of gospel, and if you get up and start singing with it, who can blame you? Nothing wrong with that. So hats off to Sully, at least someone has the balls to bring in there personal and spiritual beliefs back into music. And as far as i'm concerned this is in a category all its own. Godsmack are a great band, and i'm glad they do so well, but i always did like songs like Serenity, Voodoo, Voodoo Too, and Spiral, so i'm glad Sully took the time to venture out on his own and try something like this. I think people from all walks of music will appreciate this CD, and it will go down as the best album is about 20 years or more, for the kind of music it is. Also its great for fans of Conjure One, Deep Forest, Enya and even Tiamat. So enjoy, i do.\n", "val": 0.015453445725142956}

Is there such a thing as too literal? Well sometimes her songs are. Yes, I like autobiographical music, but something in Paula's later work just doesn't click for me-its maudlin and depressive and not in a particularly poetic way. I am glad others continue to enjoy her later work, but clearly me and a lot of other fans have become disinterested. I love Paula, but I can't get into her recent releases.

This is a beautiful album with all that is expected from Paula intact.Standout tracks:Music In MeElegyCome On InsideSomething I've Gotta SayViolet EyesP.R.E.N.U.P. is a very quirky, cute song.Waiting On A Miracle reminds me of a later Kate Bush.Music In Me was chosen as the lead single. I disagree with this choice, and would have picked either Come On Inside or Something I've Gotta Say.Sex is the perfect song for a romantic (or lonely) rainy afternoon.This album definitely deserves more praise and attention than it has been given. Paula Cole sounds absolutely amazing and hasn't lost any vocal power, which is rare for a woman her age. I highly recommend this album for anyone. I also recommend viewing the EPK, which has been posted around online. Paula seems content and peaceful with her life. Its beautiful to watch.\n", "val": 0.03428409993648529}
{"text": "THIS IS AMAZING. That's what I gotta say, what an album. I rekindled an old romance with this album, my romance with with Paula. I, like everyone had heard the gorgeous I Don't Wanna Wait over and over through the Dawson's Creek days, but she was and is far more than that song.Ithaca is deep, it's etheral, organic and just a pleasure to listen to.The standout for me is of course 'Somethin' I've Gotta Say'...it has been on repeat, I absolutely fell in love with this song after hearing only a small part on the amazon preview...also in the albums EPK, which I recommend watching, it draws you into what Paula wanted with this album. Another standout is The Hard Way, it's reaching chorus and the almost regretful feeling throughout the song is brilliant, when I listen to it it almost feels like a snapshot of what she has gone through over the last few years.I am so glad this was reccomended to me by amazon as I hadn't thought of Paula in a while, but now I am once again an avid fan praying she will tour Australia, here's hoping.\n", "val": 0.029893886297941208}
{"text": "Back in the mid-1990's there was a strong female singer/songwriter movement in popular music with Tori Amos, Liz Phair, PJ Harvey, Sophie B. Hawkins, Fiona Apple, Tracy Bonham, Alanis Morissette, Jewel, Ani DiFranco, Joan Osborne, Sarah McLachlan, and, of course, Paula Cole.Now, I had been exposed to Paula Cole before I actually knew who she was. I went to see Peter Gabriel on his \"Us\" tour in the middle of 1993, and he had a special guest--Paula Cole, before her debut album was even released. It wasn't until 1997 when \"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone\" that she re-entered my consciousness and set up shop permanently.I'm sure I was like many others after the release of \"Amen\" in 1999, in thinking 'whatever happened to Paula Cole?' She then re-emerged in 2007 with \"Courage\", and I was glad, but less than satisfied with her musical direction.Enter \"Ithaca\". Much in the same musical family as \"Courage\" with a nod to her first three albums in places. \"Ithaca\" is, plainly speaking, dull. I was not inspired by her arrangements, and her lyrics were not compelling. Her first three albums were compelling, setting soul baring lyrics to appropriate musical arrangements, creating a very satisfying experience. Now, we have gotten easy listening Cole. I understand she's older now, more mature, more centered, but this is not necessarily reflected in her music. Instead, I find Cole treading the same lyrical waters, just set to elevator music. I can hear \"Ithaca\" playing gently over a cup of coffee all over the country in the Starbucks chain. Self analysis is only interesting if you take it to interesting places musically.The strongest song here is \"Come On Inside\" which echoes \"I Don't Want To Wait\". This song has a strong musical hook, the strongest on the entire album, followed by \"Somethin' I've Gotta Say\" and \"The Hard Way\". It seems to me Cole's ballads used to really invite you in, but here \"Elegy\", \"Violet Eyes\", \"2 Lifetimes\", \"Waiting On A Miracle\", \"Sex\", they're just listless, bloodless pieces.\"Ithaca\" is my least favorite Paula Cole album. I went back and listened to all of her albums in sequential order, and I found that I even liked \"Courage\" better than \"Ithaca\". Still, I found a noticeable shift in the quality of her music after \"Amen\". The other thing I concluded is that Cole has never made a five star album. She always throws something on every album that detracts from the greatness of each of her first three albums. \"Courage\" and \"Ithaca\" are, perhaps, more cohesive, but they also lack energy, spirit, and focus.I want more from Cole than coffeehouse music. Maybe next time.Here's how \"Ithaca\" compares to Cole's previous works:1994 Harbinger: Four Stars1996 This Fire: Four Stars1999 Amen: Four Stars2007 Courage: Three and a Half Stars2010 Ithaca: Three Stars\n", "val": 6.971257971599698e-05}

{"text": "When a band's lead singer goes solo, it is usually to express musical ideas different from those of his/her band.Opening Brandon Flowers' debut CD is the theatrical ballad \"Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas\" (\"Did nobody tell you, the house will always win\"), not too far in sound from the day job. In fact, the album is produced by Stuart Price who also produced The Killers' last \"Day and age\". Not a bad thing if you, like me, are a fan of The Killers. However, the album is a patchy listening experience. It's filled with ballads, a good number of which are desperately ordinary, not doing justice to Flowers' exuberant voice, (\"Only the young\" for example) and filled with copious mention of angels and demons, salvation, and other vivid biblical imagery.Still it has its moments; the Countrified \"Hard enough\" is a duet with Jenny Lewis and sounds like Bruce Springsteen, as does the bouncy \"Jilted lovers and broken hearts\". The Country feel is felt also in \"Was it something I said?\" and \"The clock was tickin'\" with spoken Jack White-channeling verses.\"Crossfire\" is a nice ballad Coldplay or Keane-style, while the hymnal \"On the floor\" is a spare ballad. The midtempo chugging \"Right behind you\" has lovely reverbing guitars. Standout has got to be the Americana \"Playing with fire\" with a bruised Flowers sounding strangled in the wail-like chorus to stunning effect.I'm a big fan of The Killers and I must say, even their album of B-sides \"Sawdust\" is stronger and more cohesive than this. Still, this has its moments which are very good too. 3 and a half stars!\n", "val": 0.007415411528199911}

{"text": "When The Killers took their brief hiatus from touring and recording during this period,  their lead singer- composer Brandon Flowers have decided to record and release a solo  album in 2010 as this first-time solo recording became an instant hit for this charismatic  and highly acclaimed rock composer.  Named after Flamingo Roadjust located in Las  Vegas where many pivotal events on his life occurred (Sams Town Hotel And Casino is  located on the same street and also met his first wife at a thrift store), Flamingo gives us  a brilliant solo performance by this great artist whose voice and songwriting have left an  indelible mark on the music world and gave the rock scene one of the most original and  most acclaimed rock bands to make its mark on the music world.  Directly tied with Los  Vegas in both showmanship and ideology, the deluxe edition of this highly versatile hit  is showcased with sparkling, stadium ready tracks which start off with the opening track  Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas, as it proceeds well on Only The Young, Playing With  Fire, On The Floor and The Clock Was Tickin.  Plus, you even get a solid pair of tracks  that Brandon had teamed with Jenny Lewis, one of the finest rock composers, like Hard  Enough and Was It Something I Said? (with whom they both co-wrote together), as the  entire album run its successful gamut range from expert pop excursions and blues-rock  to forlorn-driven electronica and gospel sounds.  I have to highly recommend Flamingo  in its deluxe form, because it delivers a lyrical performance filled with heart and soul.\n", "val": 0.02846408821642399}

Most of the other songs on this album might fill like fillers are just forgettable, though they aren't bad. They are nice to listen to when you feel like playing the album from top to bottom. Also, if you get this album, get the deluxe edition. It makes the album feel more complete and includes the two excellent songs \"Jacksonville\" and \"Right Behind You\". Two tracks that should have been in the standard edition, in my opinion.

{"text": "I turn 60 this year, so keep that in mind that my musical experience spans over half a century.  Please, please, I'm not saying that makes me smart or that my opinions are more valid because I'm an old fart.  All I'm saying is that I am perhaps not as given to being caught up in trends.  Fair enough? (Skip to the last line if you want ONLY a review)When I first heard of the Killers I thought that, with such an inappropriate name, how could they be anything but a messed up bunch of young people.\"  So when my wife's young co-worker - who has good values - asked for Hot Fuss for her birthday, I was surprised, and my interest was piqued...after all, I'm always looking for the next legitimate contributor to music.After listening to Hot Fuss I felt it was not only great music, but that the band had the potential to last.  The potential to last comes from the songs, for sure, but it is primarily due to the fact that Brandon Flowers is fun to watch, has thought provoking lyrics, and his voice isn't the usual bland, affected, auto-tuned voice you tend to hear with so many bands and performers these days. But, at the end of the day, it was that his voice is terrific, and very interesting to listen to.  He tells stories.I thought it was a joke when someone told me Brandon Flowers is a Mormon, so I checked it out at lds.org and found that it was true.  But the video he put on that site has Crossfire and another country sounding song as background to his voice.  I loved both of the songs I heard.  Below his video it talked about how he had released a solo album in the fall of 2010, and I was surprised that I hadn't heard about it, so I watched and listened to the video several more times and, liking the songs, bought the album.My review is that Brandon Flowers, uh, delivers.  His songs are thought provoking, as I've said, but there is a yearning in his lyrics that I relate to.... that feeling that he sees things clearly in his life - people, places - and tells stories about them....that there is always something missing, or that he doesn't understand, but he observes rather than judges for the most part.  He does get personal at times, perhaps justifying his approach to life, spirituality, people, etc.  But it is sincere and interesting.As a songwriter I always start with the lyrics, so the fact that his lyrics are so good enhances my appreciation of his compositions.  If you listen to popular artists such as Coldplay you'll hear some interesting lyrics, but Chris Martin gets a little lazy and repeats his 'good lyrics' on occasion rather than come up with additional lyrics that are just as good.  It's not a cardinal sin but, to my way of thinking, it is lazy.  You can repeat lyrics but slightly change them and it's good enough, but to repeat verbatim....not good enough, at least to me.  Brandon Flowers is at 'another level,' and his voice is so very interesting, yet unpretentious.  This is not to cap on Chris Martin, but these are two important singers of our time, so comparing Flowers with Martin helps me to make a point (I like Coldplay a lot, so this is just my way of pointing out what I like about Brandon Flowers.....).Chris Martin writes a lot of songs where he sings in falsetto for most of the song.  He has a nice falsetto, but he is, after all, the composer, and can write a song in any key he chooses, so why not write it in a lower key?  To me, he does it to show that he can sing falsetto and, again, to me, it is pretentious to write songs where he is in falsetto most of - but not all of - the time.  The purpose of a song should be to deliver a message through music, not to say \"look what I can do.\"  And the fact is that, as good as his falsetto is, when any singer goes into, then pulls out of, falsetto, there is a difference in tonal timbre.  It is distracting to the melody, at least for me.  The first popular artist to use falsetto on almost every song was David Gates of Bread.  He used it to make the music more interesting (singing in that upper register to expand the range of the melody), but not to 'show off.'Now back to my review of Brandon Flowers: his voice is at once rich, gritty, baritone, tenor, but always - always - expressive in a way that expands the power of the lyrics and music.  He is, to me - as opposed to Chris Martin - a pure musician.  No weird graffiti on his keyboards or other instruments, just pure, American music.  His singing, even his little flirtations with falsetto, seems authentic - yes, they are done for effect, but the effect relates to the song, not to the fact that 'he can do it.'In closing, it is interesting that many people thought the Killers were European at first (and they've been, if anything, more popular in Europe than anywhere else, so the impression, while unintended, was genuinely derived).  I love most great music, from sacred to Peter, Paul & Mary, from Steve Winwood to Iron Maiden, so my biases are limited.  But, if I had to say one thing about British music vs. American rock it is that British music tends to be more sophisticated, the harmonies tighter, the lyrics less whimsical, the arrangements richer unpredictable, as opposed to being a platform for an inevitable lead guitar solo preceded by 2 verses, followed by a verse, a bridge, and a final verse.  These are a few of the more refined qualities that I see in British bands, and I find them to be present in the music of the Killers, and I think it is a compliment that they were seen that way.  Brandon Flowers take this one step further, and assimilates these elements so they authentically flavor his work.Everyone is influenced by the music they hear, the artists they see perform.  So, at some level, imitation is always a part of the recipe.  But I find the Killers' music to be genuine because, as opposed to mimicking these elements, it integrates them into the personality of their work.  These influences are therefore not karaoke-like, but have been ingested such that they become part of the fabric of their music.

{"text": "First, yes, I'm a little biased because I love the Killers and Flowers' voice. I found this album very similar to Sawdust and Day and Age in sound but also a step forward for Flowers. It's layered with a hint of arrogance, but that's ok because Flowers should be. He is one of the more unique and interesting (and successful) artists around. Great songs but with only 10 tracks, 2 of which are meh (tracks 5 and 10 although both do pick up), is what leaves me to only give this album 4. Those 8 tracks are great, fun, moody, and stick in your head. My wife was singing along within a few listens. Pick up if you enjoy the Killers newer stuff and you won't be dissappointed, but it's also enough deviation to enjoy it as something new.  I don't think it will convert anyone though.\n", "val": 0.018969552591443062}
{"text": "If you love the Killers, it is likely because of the killer voice of Brandon Flowers. Nothing great about the Killers is lost on this album in my opinion. He still has that great voice that makes you smile, the fabulous electric pop sound that keeps your arms up, and beats that spur movement! I listen to it when I workout or when I'm driving. Now, some of the songs are more lulling in pace compared to what the Killers produced, but all the soul and sound is there, so those are the best parts for me.\"On the Floor\" has a good 'ol Vegas/Elvis vibe, but it is really slow and introspective, whereas \"Magdelena\" is more upbeat and has a similar feel to \"I Can't Stay\" from the Killers' album Day & Age, with all its southwest-Mex imagery.Now there have been many a time when I like an artist because I have heard a couple of his or her songs on the radio, so I go for the album only to be disappointed that out of 10 or so songs, the two I heard on the radio are the only ones that I really liked, but that is NOT the case here. Unlike those other artist's solo albums, you will like many of the songs on Flamingo- I strongly dislike the name \"Flamingo,\" but absolutely love the songs! Check it out and enjoy!\n", "val": 0.015755554661154747}

{"text": "I am not a huge fan of today's music scene; in fact, I am quite out-of-touch. Brandon Flowers and the Killers are the exception, though. I find Flowers' writing style and very presence quite an enigma on the music scene. In an industry that glamorizes hedonism, excess, and self-indulgence, Brandon not only remains in touch with his spiritual roots, but goes so far as to openly explore them.I know that a lot of people who are not religious may have found this album a bit too much, but in my estimation, it was another chapter in his own spiritual journey -- a journey which I have found fascinating since the release of \"Sam's Town.\" Given the enormous part that religion plays in his own life, I was expecting at least some spiritual content on this album. Boy, was I surprised -- and pleasantly so. This album is literally saturated in spirituality. Given my own Christian beliefs, I very much appreciated this effort, although I guess I can understand why some people might be turned off.Even so, this album not only entertained me, but moved me, spoke to me, and made me think. I find it quite courageous that Brandon is even willing to explore such things. He bares his soul and touches on subjects that most people would deem too \"controversial\" for mainstream. Not since the late, great George Harrison has an artist (at least a secular artist) come forth so boldly and proclaimed his beliefs so openly. Of course, Brandon has never been one to keep his opinion or feelings to himself.My favorite tracks on this album are \"Only The Young,\" \"On The Floor,\" and \"Swallow It.\" It is a refreshing listen after the disappointment (IMO) that was \"Day and Age.\" The only songs that I really don't like off of this album are \"Jacksonville\" and \"Right Behind You.\" While I do not agree with his belief system, I still find myself personally enriched by this work.\n", "val": 0.027964947745203972}

But then I was. It reminded me of Queen. Now I love it.Magdalena was supposed to be a good track so I sampled that. Liked it.Went out and got the Deluxe Edition and kicked myself for not getting it earlier and letting total strangers talk me out of getting it.Flamingo doesn't have the stadium sound that the first two Killers albums have but it's not a band album, it's solo and it's very imtimate.The Killers Day and Age (their best in my opinion) toned the rock down a notch and Brandon's toned down even further here.We're left with a bunch of personal songs that are catchy and dynamic.There are Killers flavors of course but a Killers album couldn't be this heart felt.Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas is a great sweeping opener.Only The Young is an awesome track. It has many layers and a welcome break form the standard pop/rock fare that hits our airways.Hard Enough doesn't do a lot for me. It's one of two weak ballads on offerJilted Lovers is highlight. Probably the song closest to The Killers.Playing With Fire is the other weak track. A bit country. Does build but donesn't go far.Was It Something I Said? is a cracker. Poppy and massively catchy.Magdalena is a up great up tempo balladCrossfire is just awesomeOn The Floor is a slow burning corker. Took some getting into initially but is a favorite - one of many includingSwallow It which is a another corker. (Corker is a good thing by the way if you're not used to that expression)I feel bad for anyoe who doesn't have the Deluxe Edition because two of the four songs are just brilliant and the other two are great.The Clock Was Tickin' took some getting into (for a non-country liker it was very off putting at first) but when you listen to the lyrics, it just hits you and hooks you in. Right Behind You reminds me of early 80's Robert Palmer and is one of the best songs on the whole album. I can't believe it was left off the initial 10 track selection. Truely brilliant song.Jacksonville and I Came Here To Get Over You are the other two bonus track and are both worthy additions. I Came Here is a great track also. Catchy. Has a Bob Dylan vocal thing going on in the middle. Lesser so Jacksonville, which is a great bonus track but not really album worthy (given the other material here - for the majority of other artist it would be worthy).Don't compare to The Killers (hard I know) but buy it as a stand alone release.\n", "val": 0.018545659258961678}
{"text": "This year was a big year for Killer's fans.  While the Killers decided to go on break lead singer Brandon Flowers recorded a solo album called Flamingo in early September.  The Killers are my favorite band and I was excited to hear any new material even if it was only from one of its members.  I followed the release very closely finding live versions of many of the songs before the official release.  Having a good idea of the main concept of the album I had a good feeling about things to come.The album drops and to my surprise it was awesome.  In terms of how it sounds compared to the Killers it is missing that stadium rocking sound however, the sound and meaning is still present.  There are a few songs that sound straight from a Killers album such as Crossfire and Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts.  Flowers is responsible for most of the song writing for the Killers anyway so there isn't much of a leap in his solo work.  The appeal of the album for me is the lyrics and music produced by Flowers.  While many of the songs start off soft and low, they usually build up to a more energetic climax near the end.  One in particular, Playing with Fire, is fitting used for Flower's closing song in live performance.  A majority of the songs replace that Killers guitar sound with synths and acoustics, but the songs themselves could easily be adapted into the Killer's repertoire.  The is also one song that I have to commend for its amazing lyrics.  The track entitled Magdalena is a song written by Flowers inspired by a religious pilgrimage in Mexico.  If you can a chance I urge you to give the song a listen, and more importantly look up the lyrics.  The lyrics are truly dynamic, and if read without music it would sound like something out of a novel.  In addition to the 10 tracks the deluxe version of the album contains four bonus songs.  The two stand outs are The Clock was Tickin and Right Behind You.  The Clock was Tickin is actually the original version of another track on the album called Was it Something I Said or Did.  Listening to those two tracks side by side is pretty interesting.  Right Behind You has become one of my favorites on the album which is why I included it at the bottom of this post.  That track has a more genuine Killer's sound to it, almost as if it could have been released on Hot Fuss their debut album.Anyway let me get on to the live performance part of this review.  I have seen Brandon Flowers live twice now.  And I feel it is safe to say that his performances are awesome.  I had first seen him play at Highline Ballroom in Manhattan.  This was actually before the albums release, which was a little weird because no one knew the lyrics to most of the songs, except for the people like me who studied the YouTube live videos beforehand.  The concert was relatively short. especially since there was no opening act.  However, he ended the night of nicely with an acoustic version of When You Were Young.  After the show I actually got to meet the two female background singers and snagged a picture with them.  The highlight of the night, for me at least, was when I got to meet Brandon Flowers and get his autograph.  I never thought I would ever get to meet him, or even be within ten feet of him for that matter.About a week ago I went to see him at another performance in Manhattan this time at Hammerstein Ballroom.  I had a much bigger crew with me the second time around I an was anxious to see what the \"newcomers\" thought about the performance.  Now I will admit that I am extremely biased when it comes to anything that has to do with the Killers, but I feel confident in saying that anyone would have enjoyed that concert.  The guy played great music and he fun to watch on stage.  This second concert was much longer than the first.  It included almost all of the material from his album.  The highlight of the night was an encore performance of a medley of Read My Mind and Only the Young which then led into Mr . Brightside.  Overall the concert was one of the best that I have ever been to, and it only got better when we got some Halal food after the show.Let me get to the point here because I am getting distracted from watching Dexter.  I am not sure how I will be rating albums on here.  So at this point let me keep it simple and say that Flamingo is definitely worth listening to.  As for the concerts if Flowers ever comes back to New York I highly recommend going to see him live.Check out more reviews at [...]\n", "val": 0.013426435180008411}

{"text": "I am the biggest Killers fan - all albums I love and value the difference in them.But, be aware when you buy his solo album, sweet but almost too sweet. I understand Europe, especially the UK has a different spin on him, and he is lovely, but I was a little let down, considering he did mention that some of these tracks were meant for The Killers, and I wonder what direction and sound they would have produced with them. Secondly, I needed to hear some a mix of beats and themes in his music writing, too much one way is not enough value for entire album purchase. But luckily, this album was priced lower, and I think the label understood this and his popularity in the U.S. market, that is why you see him do more shows in other parts of the world, where he clearly has The Killers market behind him, now he really needs to get the band back together in reality. Two good songs on this album: Flamingo: Crossfire and his duo \"Hard Enough\" which no radio station or college alternative plays. But that is the music industry - and that is individual taste. Welcome to America and our ability to like what we like. I give it two stars, fitting for the most I found in this album. I would really love to see his solo performance to get a better perspective.Let's face it, there are so many bands out there producing and I just don't think this album was up to standards (producing) to where Brand Flowers or BR of The Killers should be. It was elementary for him and for world know record label.Saying all that, I like the two songs and love BR/The Killers. I would to see BR solo tour and of course, I would love to see The Killers back being a band and jointly producing some great music. (ps. I spent over $15,000 in the last 4 years seeing TK and even saw them making their DVD at the Royal Albert in London, so I am fan and proud of it.)\n", "val": 0.0027713014278560877}

I'm a huge fan, but my point is I didn't just buy this because it was Brandon Flowers. This is one of the very few CD's that I felt it was necessary to buy. Usually I just go for a digital download or something along those lines, but this I felt it was necessary that I own it.On this Album Brandon Flowers does his own thing for sure, but I still feel that it has a bit of that Killers flair. So if you're looking for something to sound exactly like what you've been hearing on previous Killers albums, you might be disappointed. If you're looking for something great, and something that has the same sort of feel as what you've heard on Killers albums, you might find yourself enjoying this CD. Like on previous Killers albums, the lyrics are compelling, and the sound is original.I disagree with the reviews saying that the only decent song on here is \"Crossfire\". Although it's one of my favorites on the album, it's certainly not all the album has to offer. The album opens with \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\". This does a great job of setting the tone for the CD. Some of my other favorite tracks would have to be \"Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts\" \"Magdalena\" \"On the Floor\" and \"Swallow it\".I STRONGLY suggest buying the Deluxe Edition for the bonus tracks. I LOVE all four of them. Though \"The Clock was Tickin'\" has a different sound that might not be appealing to some, it's lyrics are incredible.

Comparisons of \"Flamingo\" to the Killers will ultimately be a waste of time because they are comparisons of music made by four men, to music made by only one of those four men. If you take a musical quartet and remove (or replace) three of the members, you shouldn't expect the same sort of result. What this album shows us is that Brandon Flowers is not the The Killers; it's not Brandon and his backing band. Before hearing this album, I believed that Brandon Flowers was what made the Killers, and that \"Flamingo\" would be, essentially, another Killers album. I was wrong.Personally, I did enjoy this album. By no stretch of the imagination can it be placed on an equal level with the albums of the Killers, but that is not immediate grounds for condemning it. Placed next to \"Hot Fuss,\" it's rather weak, but placed next to most other pop/rock albums produced in 2010, it stands up rather well.

This is an extraordinary gift and Flowers has it.

Make it your own!Other Comparable Albums I have been listening to:Johnny Cash American V : A Hundred HighwaysJosh Ritter : Golden Age of RadioBob Dylan : Freewheelin' Bob DylanAll of these are amazing albums, Flowers sings his album at a younger age than Cash and doesn't achieve the sort of simple wisdom that Cash is able to convey with American V, but nonetheless Flamingo runs deep indeed!Out on a Wire is EPIC!\n", "val": 0.060319505631923676}

{"text": "The ever ambitious Brandon Flowers takes the time that The Killers are on break from making music to...make music. \"Flamingo,\" like the Springsteen influenced \"Sam's Town,\" is another ode to Las Vegas, except this time, Flowers decides to run stylistically amok. Surprisingly enough, it works. I've come to enjoy \"Flamingo\" more than I did The Killers' \"Day and Age.\"Once again, Flowers is feeling is inner Bruce, but it seems more tempered this time. The duet with Jenny Lewis on \"Hard Enough\" has a softer core than most of The Killers' best songs yet rates right up there with the band for emotional impact. I suspect producer Daniel Lanois' touch in the more atmospheric sound, as Flowers allows the songs to breathe on their own. Not that Flowers resists the urge to rock; both \"Crossfire\" and \"Was It Something I Said\" could easily have been Killers songs.What one can hope for from \"Flamingo\" is that maybe some of what Flowers has picked up will rub off on his regular band; I'd love to hear them take on the slow-burn build-up of a song like \"Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts.\" Or maybe see if The Killers could take on something as tempered as \"Playing With Fire.\" A pleasant surprise overall, \"Flamingo\" reinforces the notion that Flowers is a serious talent with ambition to burn.\n", "val": 0.019584739580750465}

{"text": "Read my other reviews and you'll notice a pattern. I'll let everyone else debate the merits of the album. This review is for those eager to buy the album but are still deciding about know which version to get.DOWNLOAD Versus CD? - Depends on sale priceIf the download is still sale priced at or below five clams when you see this AND you're just a casual fan - I'd go download. It's an incredible deal. Sonically, there's not much a difference in sound the way this album is mixed.CD Versus Deluxe CD?The one thing the regular edition of the CD has going for it is the traditional jewel case. An easier to access CD and a booklet that won't get worn down too easily. The Deluxe edition is in an annoying DigiPak - the type where you need to seriously wrestle with it to remove the disc without snapping it in half. Once I liberated mine, I re-housed it in a regular slimline case. The colorful booklet is stitched into the digipak case, which looks lovely, but needs to be handled with white gloves to preserve it's condition. In an odd move, the side pocket that could have housed the CD (preferred) or booklet is instead stuffed with a 2-sided mini poster. Clearly, they are going after the tween girl demographic with this move, but if my phantom baby daughter tucked a poster of a 30-year old man in her locker, I would buy her some Bieber stat.The main reason to go Deluxe is the 4 bonus tracks. You get \"The Clock Was Ticking\" - a Grand Ole Opry country romp that also recalls the lyrical pace of The Nails' \"88 Lines for 44 Women\" and Jim Carrol's \"People Who Died.\" \"Jacksonville\" is an album highlight - a trippy number with a slinky beat and a chilling woven bass guitar line. \"I Came Here To Get Over You\" almost sounds like a great lost Weezer song and \"Right Behind You\" brings the album to a proper close with heavy wet synths.Overall - this album, even more than the b-sides comp \"Sawdust\" feels like a full-fledged Killers album. I recently bought solo outings from Paul Banks (Interpol) and Julian Casablancas (The Strokes) - both tread new territory, but were so sterile they left me little inspiration for repeat listens. Flamingo is much more warm and inviting, like Las Vegas luring headlights down Highway 15 in the dead of night.\n", "val": 0.00023375777527689934}
{"text": "As a Killers fan, I was interested Mr. Flower's solo project and I must say I was quite surprised as I keep returning for repeated listening.  And with each listening it keeps getting better and better.  Like Las Vegas itself, it is bold, brassy, crazy and seemingly without logic, but there is a lot here once you get past the neon lights. Impeccable craftsmanship, solid melodies, catchy hooks and lyrics that will peak your interest.I will go so far to say as a whole I probably enjoy Flamingo more than any Killer's album - It's that good.

{"text": "Flamingo (Deluxe Edition) by Brandon Flowers is an album I would call a \"beautiful mess\". I had high hopes for Brandon's first solo effort. I love The Killers and I knew that this album would be very different but sometimes change is not always a good thing. Brandon's voice and melodies have always bring his strong attributes but the concept and lyrical structure fall flat and after listening to this album for 56 minutes - instead of feeling refreshed, all I feel is confused and drained. Half of Flamingo is great and the rest is just so-so. Standout tracks include: Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas, Hard Enough (featuring Jenny Lewis), Playing with Fire (this track gets better as it goes along), Magdalena, Crossfire, On the Floor, Swallow It, and The Clock was Tickin' (a surprise gem). I have been listening to this album for a month now and I sorta like it but I don't love it. Brandon Flowers is a talented artist but I think he does his best work with his boys backing him up. 3 1/2 stars for Flamingo.\n", "val": 8.545168384443969e-05}

Thus, I wanted to wait until I could fully digest this new Brandon Flowers' production.After a month of listening, I can say that I really like this album.  Every single song is different on this album, which I can't ever remember thinking about any album.  Yet they still seem to sound like they go together.  This is a much more subdue album than any Killers album, but there is still the catchy sing-a-long lyrics that one would expect from Brandon Flowers.If you didn't like The Killers I don't think this will change your mind.  However, this album does make me appreciate the other 3/4 of The Killers.  Mark, Ronnie, and Dave often get over looked, but I think when you don't hear them playing you appreciate more of what they bring to a Killers' song.This is a great album start to finish, it will just take a few listens to fully appreciate.

{"text": "Bruce Springsteen's anticipated \"The Promise\" (coing in November) may displace Brandon Flower's solo debut as the \"best of the best\" for 2010, but Flower's ambitious album is a magnificent work.  Flowers, on a break from The Killers, has managed to find his own voice and put out a fantastic solo album that is not just some Killers-redux.  This is a unqiue and gifted recording.  Tip: Buy this deluxe version of the album so you will get all 14 of his new songs.  Virtually every track is a gem, and there are enough catchy hooks throughout to fill a tackle box.Flowers demonstrates admirable ability, taking cues from country, new wave, rock, and even some hymn-like arrangements to craft songs that are familiar and yet entirely new. His lyrics are also interesting and draw the ear and mind for repeated listening.  On \"Playing with Fire,\" for example, Flowers professes, \"Ten thousand Demons hammer down with every footstep,/Ten thousand Angels rush the wind against my back./ The church of mine may not be recognized by steeple,/ That doesn't mean that I will walk without a God.\"  At times spiritual, and sometime sentimental, Flowers paints some artful images in these songs.  In \"Welcome to Fabulous Law Vegas,\" anyone who has ever visited Sin City will recognize his description of the Strip. On \"The Clock Keeps Ticking,\" he belts out a country ditty that is both poignant and funny.My one beef with the deluxe album:  the electronic booklet does NOT contain any lyrics! What a waste.I have given this album over a dozen full plays since purchasing it, and I'm still very drawn to the music and the lyrics on every track. This is a solid achievement.\n", "val": 0.025538712739944458}
{"text": "What is it with the negative mentality from fans when a lead singer goes solo? I am glad I grew up during a different era when it was just fine for a lead singer to go solo with fans. For example, Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, David Lee Roth, Peter Cetera, Jon Anderson, etc., etc. Nowadays it seems there's this negative element involved for no really good reason.Brandon Flowers of The Killers releases his first solo album and it's, \"This isn't what I expected\" or \"This is another Killers album\" or \"The fans who give this positive reviews are deluded\", etc., etc. The fact of the matter is The Killers are popular right now, \"Flamingo\" entered the Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart in the top ten, the first single \"Crossfire\" has done well on the charts.Also, Flowers brings in the heavy artillery with three great producers: Stuart Price (New Order, Madonna, Scissor Sisters, Pet Shop Boys, Gwen Stefani, Seal and Keane), Daniel Lanois (U2, Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson) and Brendan O'Brien (Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam, Rage Against The Machine, Korn, The Offspring, Train, Bruce Springsteen, Incubus, The Music, The Wallflowers, Audioslave, The Bravery, Velvet Revolver and AC/DC). This has ensured a quality product. Plus a duet with Riley Kilo's lead singer Jenny Lewis on \"Hard Enough\".I listened to all three Killers albums in sequential order prior to listening to \"Flamingo\", and I have to say I liked \"Flamingo\" slightly more than The Killers albums. This is the first album where I felt there was a musical unity throughout. I did not feel, upon repeated listening, that there were any weak tracks here. Some are better than others, but overall the album sounded good, not great. Flowers (and The Killers) still have the potential to develop into a classic rock band, but they have yet to hit their stride.Growing up in the 1980's, this album reminded me of many other artists/bands from that era with a modern polish, and The Killers are, after all, a retro band, a post-new wave revival band. Flowers' influences are also from that era, and they are evident here.\"Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas\" is a great, grand, sweeping opener. \"Only The Young\", the album's second single, is a beautifully sung, electronic ballad. \"Hard Enough\" has a country tinge with a carefully placed hook in the chorus. \"Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts\" is the most Killers sounding track and one of the fastest paced tracks here. \"Playing With Fire\" might be the weakest track here, but it redeems itself in its melody line during the second half of the song. \"Was It Something I Said?\" has a good melody. \"Magdalena\" is pure vocal hook magic. \"Crossfire\" is likewise catchy and melodic. \"On The Floor\" and \"Swallow It\" finish off the original 10 track album with more hooks. The four bonus tracks are equally as good with \"The Clock Was Tickin'\" and \"Jacksonville\" being very catchy.Overall, \"Flamingo\" deserves four stars for its great production and hooks galore. Anyone can quibble over the lyrical content here, and many have complained about the religious content, but I inspected the lyrics online and did not feel Flowers was being overly preachy. I mean give me a break here. There are so many other artists that are absolutely preachy in their convictions, and who cares? That's what's great about popular music--passion, conviction, opinions, points of view, attitudes. People are so easily perturbed by the smallest things.Here's how \"Flamingo\" compares to The Killers:2004 Hot Fuss: Four Stars2006 Sam's Town: Three and a Half Stars2008 Day & Age: Three and a Half Stars2010 Flamingo: Four Stars (from a biased, non-zealous fan)\n", "val": 0.013304835185408592}
{"text": "As a fairly huge Killers fan, I bought this CD with excitement and anticipation. B-Flow doesn't entirely disappoint, that's not what i'm trying to say. However, there is something lacking on this album. Some songs sound hollow and all too fragmented, while his frequently utilized upper vocal register fades into the background during some tracks. That, or he squeals the notes to the point where they sound irritating or piercing (listen to \"Was it Something I Said?\"). Many of the songs seems to be going somewhere, then dissolve before reaching their peak. The better tracks: \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" (a heartfelt ode to his hometown), \"Hard Enough\" (a bit hollow, but his voice blends well with Jenny Lewis'), \"Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts\" (will sound a bit more familiar to Killers fans), \"Magdalena\" (poetic and simplistic, doesn't over-do it in the upper vocal register, easily my favorite track on the album), and one of the bonus tracks, \"The Clock Was Tickin'\" (a solid attempt at a country-esque tune, works well with his voice). Many of the other tracks are just okay to me, nothing that I truly detest, but it's certainly not what I expected when I heard Brandon Flowers was to release a solo album. If you're a big Killers fan and you're going to buy the CD no matter what I say, more power to ya, you might enjoy it. All I can say is that I hope he gets back together with the Killers realll soon.

{"text": "I'm reading these reviews and I can fairly say that any over-zealously generous reviews of this album are prejudiced by blind love for Brandon Flowers...I am familiar with The Killers' past work, including the artist-emulating transitions they've made from album to album. It has always been a disappointment to me to find the self-announced \"creative\" minds behind such albums to, in the same breath, parallel themselves with another artist. First it was 80's pop with a glam-rock Bowie'tude, followed by a sophomore album; cheap homage to Depeche Mode. They even had the nerve to slap Anton Corbijn photography and cinematography everywhere, so all the fans knew they were using Depeche Mode's photographer. Then came karaoke night in true Vegas fashion, with the pseudo imitations of U2, Bruce Springsteen (AS IF,) and Bob Dylan.Now THE Brandon Flowers blossoms off in to his own project, 'Flamingo'. His voice is incredibly poor; it sounds as though he's fidgeting at the mike. He's been doing this for WAY to long to be allowing his voice-diction and control to suffer. As an added bonus, all the songs sound the same. Whomever told him this was a good idea should be fired from IDJ; unless he had no choice because the rest of the guys were finally sick of working with him. Wouldn't be the first time he's had that problem...The album is crap. Bowie, Bono, Springsteen, etc. They perform as masters of their craft.

The songs seem to envelop a more bluesy, country feel. In addition, a certain collaborative feeling seems lost, and it's easy to tell that Brandon Flowers is alone in producing this work.I'm not saying the songs on this album suck, they just lack the flare that The Killers were so amazing at and famed for.

{"text": "I remember watching The Killers on a late night tv appearance. Brandon Flowers was singing, \"I got soul...\", with his body moving in that weird, stiff, uptight, and awkward Ian Curtis fashion. He was trying so hard to clap his hands and keep singing. It was more like Don \"No Soul\" Simmons. On top of that comedic effort, he was also singing out of tune. Did anyone really expect this album to be any better?Flowers sings here with his typical heavy handed, takes-himself-way-too-seriously, \"I'm being introspective now, guys\" style, complete with the false emotion and lackluster attempts at \"bravado\" that we're used to cringing at from The Killers. And yes, he continues the bad, out of tune, feeble singing.Other than being horrible, the album actually sounds pretty good, as far as recording quality, balance, and production. But it does sound a bit empty, which we often see on records featuring frontpeople-gone-solo. It's supposed to make the singer's voice stand on it's own, so we can see the power of his or her raw talent and emotion in the most intimate way possible. But, this is often just an excuse for bad songwriting, or a possible indication that the singer doesn't have that much musical talent after all, since there just isn't that much music going on there.The songs are simplistic, and I would call them underdeveloped, but I can't say for sure that all of these were even decent songs to begin with. This album reminds me of a print-out of a rough draft. As in, \"Ok, I'm going to write a song. What things do I need to put in it?\" But he just copied the example and didn't add any touches. You can still see the \"Insert Name Goes Here\", \"Insert Title Here\", form boxes in the tunes. If you like radio music, you still might find this utterly boring and devoid of emotion and traces of humanity. It might make you physically ill, like it did to me.

{"text": "This review includes \"The Deluxe Edition\" additional songs.The Killer's Brandon Flowers has always been one of those frontmen who seem to be specifically built for the limelight.  Often built so well that being backed by a band does not due because of the desire to express himself with his own creativity with his own fenceless boarders.  Flowers has accomplished that with \"Flamingo,\" his first solo effort.  The album is made up of The Killers styled ballads, but lacks the grand scale of some of the band's outings.  To put \"Flamingo\" in perspective with The Killer's own music...Flowers brings a lot more \"Human\" than he does \"Somebody Told Me.\"  Which might be a good thing or bad depending on why you enjoy The Killers music.  But it is safe to say that with Flowers, you will enjoy the album if you are a fan of The Killers, but if you are not a fan of the band, you probably will not be a fan of this music.Track to track ratings:1.) Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas 3/5This track is obviously an introduction to the album.  It seems like it introduces the concept of the album.  Being that Flowers and The Killers's hometown is Las Vegas, this is an ode to the city in some regards.  It comes off a little more of a commercial for the Strip than anything else, but is still a very listen-able track that does not need to be skipped.  However, after a couple of listens, many will.2.) Only the Young 4/5\"Only the Young\" will come across to listener's immediately who enjoy some of The Killer's more \"ballad-like\" tracks.  It reminds me of \"Human,\" but lyrically sets it apart.  It is a very introspective account from Flowers that is touching in its tone and speed.  It is a track that will give the listener a clue as to what is to come throughout the album.  A great track.3.) Hard Enough 3/5This track one that is another slow paced song which is backed by a female vocalist.  This gives it an almost duet like characteristic which will give the song a \"folk-like\" tone.  It reminds me of something that Bob Dylan would record in his early days.  This is one song that separates Brandon Flowers from any of The Killers creations.  A good track though.4.) Jilted Lovers & Heartbreaks 3/5On this track Flowers brings his lead singer talents to the forefront with his energy and jilted lyrics.  Many of his songs have longer, but lyrically strong choruses.  This is one of them.  A good track.5.) Playing with Fire - 5/5The introduction to this track is slowly brought in by instruments which give it a very mellow beginning.  It sets the mood perfectly.  Flowers steps up and gives the song a very emotional flare with is lyrics and tone.  One of strongest \"emotional\" tracks on the album.  The chorus is excellent and it does a great job at making the song enjoyable to listen to and not such a \"downer.\"6.) Was It Something I Said 5/5This is the first track that will remind listeners immediately of The Killers.  It is upbeat and strong.  Lyrically, Flowers once again brings his talents.  It is a feel good track of sorts.  Including the song at this point of the album is a great transition from the more mellow tracks before it.  An excellent song.7.) Magdelena 4/5Another track that feeds off the song before it.  The energy is there and it will once again remind listeners of a song that could have easily been included on a past Killers album.8.) Crossfire 5/5\"Crossfire\" has always given me the same feeling as \"Human\" did when it was first debuted.  And with \"Crossfire\" once again, I love it.  One of the best tracks on the ablum, no doubt.  Lyrically it is as strong as any song created by Flowers (or the Killers) in my opinion.  The chorus and the bridge is one of the best I have heard in recent years.  The obvious first single off the album.9.) On the Floor 4/5This song calms the energy from the three tracks before it.  It is another track that brings an emotional tone that is mixed with mellow instruments and slow spoken words.  It's a mellow track on a large scale.  Towards the end of the song Flowers is backed by a choir which gives the song a different feel at the end as it did from the beginning.  A great track.10.) Swallow It 4/5Lyrically, many can decipher the words and speculate on what Flowers had in mind as far as symbolizing the phrase \"Swallow It.\"  But with that regard, the song itself is a solid outing.  It is interesting that he would close the album out with this track, but maybe he wanted to end with a potential single.  Because this could be.DELUXE BONUS SONGS11.) The Clock Was Tickin' 3/5If other songs on the album reminded me of something Bob Dylan would have recorded than this track is a spot on Dylan influenced track.  It has an almost \"twangy\" instrumental backing it and the lyrics provide a story straight out of any southern town (but not limited to).  Halfway into it, it transforms into a more traditional Flower's track; which seems to bring it back full circle.12.) Jacksonville 5/5This is my favorite track of the DELUXE edition and one of the my favorites in general.  It has an eclectic feel with a grand chorus that is enjoyable to listen to.  It feels like an inspiration from The Killers debut album \"Hot Fuss.\"  It can be a single worthy song, which is confusing to think they would only include it in the deluxe edition.13.) I Came to Get Over You 3/5Some of these songs, as i've said before, will remind you of The Killers more than others and this is one that will once again have you saying, \"this could have been on any of the Killers albums.\"  But it wasn't and seems more like a song that would have been included on the \"Sawdust\" album (which was a collection of cuts that never made it to any of the official Killer ablbums).  That was a decent album and this is a decent song.14.) Right Behind You 5/5One of my favorite tracks on the ENTIRE album, and once again, it is strange that this one is only included in the DELUXE edition.  It's energy and tone give it an all around grand scale.  The chorus is infectious and will have you singing (even silently) along with it.  The instrumentals set it apart from any other track on the album.  With this track and \"Jacksonville,\" the DELUXE edition of the album is more than worth it.All in all, Flowers gives what is expected of him.  As with any album, give it multiple listens to fully grasp its range and impact.  This is easily one of the best Rock Pop albums put out this year.  If you are a fan of The Killers, it is another must have.  But even if you are not, listen to the singles at least.\n", "val": 0.019090862944722176}
{"text": "As the lead singer and key songwriter of The Killers, it's not surprising to find similar and frequent references to Brandon Flowers' hometown of Las Vegas on his first solo record. From the album's title, named after the famous Vegas casino, to the opening track \"Welcome to the Fabulous Las Vegas,\" these references are also far from hidden. Although The Killers' second record, Sam's Town, drew many comparisons to Bruce Springsteen, Flamingo plays as if each call came straight from The Boss' playbook.Daniel Lanois, known for his longstanding production relationships with both U2 and Bob Dylan, lends his hand to Flamingo in a very characteristic fashion.The delay effects heard on the album's lead single, \"Crossfire\" offer an airy effect reminiscent of nearly every U2 album while the added presence and clarity of the vocals within the mix puts the importance of the lyrics in focus. This is actually what sets Flowers' solo venture apart from the three existing Killers records.Under The Killers' umbrella, guitar solos and more elaborate instrumental sections provide the driving force of the music, but Lanois' mixes keep all of the instrumentation ever so slightly in the distance.Fans of The Killers will not be disappointed with Flowers' solo outing. There are less standout singles, but as a whole, Flamingo is an enjoyable side-step from the grandiose anthems The Killers have provided us for the better part of a decade.Similar Artists: The Killers, Bruce SpringsteenTrack Suggestion: \"Crossfire\"\n", "val": 0.019002629444003105}

By the 4th listen I really loved the album. Flowers lyrics and song-writing are clever, interesting, and even deep and reflective in parts (aka \"the fountain of youth has been reduced to a drip\"). It's not the Killers. In fact it's more alt-country than anything the Killers have done. I was surprised how much this song focused on Las Vegas. This albums takes you to Vegas, walks you down the strip and keeps you there. It doesn't have the mass appeal, and I'm kind of glad.

{"text": "It's safe to say that it appears Brandon Flowers purposely avoided creating something that would be held to the standards of a Killers release.  It's a very wide array of styling and vocal presentation, and if you got the deluxe 14-song version, there are some quirky, yet catchy tunes added.  It's hard for me to compare Brandon's style to anything current (aside from The Killers), especially being a member of the \"I hate what's on the radio right now\" crowd, and I think that's what draws me into it.Opening with \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" certainly sets the stage for the album, just like its city namesake, you never know what to expect, but there's a good bet it's going to be amazing!  Tracks like \"Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts\", \"Magdalena\", and \"Crossfire\" really anchor the album well, and the slower \"Playing With Fire\" & \"Only The Young\" make it a wide-reaching collection.  I don't find any of these tracks boring, and being a Killers fan, I found \"Everything Will Be Alright\" from Hot Fuss, and \"Goodnight, Travel Well\" from Day & Age to be relentlessly boring.  Overall, I think Brandon did a great job of showing what he can do with his \"solo legs\" and for compiling a pleasantly addicting listen.

{"text": "I'm not a die-hard Killers fan or collector but their last release, Day and Age, caught my attention and now I would consider it to be in my top 10 of all time. Of course I realize Brandon Flowers is only one fourth of that group and I shouldn't hold this release up to the standards of any previous Killers album, but since he literally is the voice that keeps them together I was expecting at least some familiarity on his new solo release, Flamingo, while at the same time trying to keep an open mind to the changes and progressions that would naturally arise with his wider range of artistic freedom. I was ready for anything and really looking forward to this.But after several listens, I just cannot get into this record at all. It is such a radical departure from anything I would have expected from Mr. Flowers, not to mention the usually upbeat Stuart Price and the other producers listed, whom I generally do like. I'm not going to use the word \"bad\" here because it most certainly is not. In fact lyrically it's very thoughtful and provocative and he really does come off as a wonderful poet in his own right with a knack for Springsteen-esque \"story songs.\" However, the music is so dull and minimal that it kind of negates the point of even trying to make a full-length song out of it at all, as opposed to maybe just a spoken word piece. There are no hooks or catchy melodies present and several tracks have a non-structural, folksy air about them that might make one wonder if he's making this up as he goes along. Nothing pops out at you as being especially noteworthy and it sounds unfinished, hence no good guesses about possible future, radio-friendly singles. Luckily I purchased the 14-track deluxe edition because the four bonus songs are actually quite good and even a little catchy (I dare you not to tap your toes to \"Clock Was Ticking\") but by track 11, it's too little, too late. I can only imagine the disappointment I would have felt had I got the standard 10-track edition.In closing, it's very evident Flowers is a creative soul, but he sounds oddly restrained and Flamingo comes off as just a preliminary sketch of the album he REALLY wanted to make. I tried my best to abandon all expectations and was still underwhelmed, so I cannot in good conscience recommend this to major Killers fans. Even those with a casual interest may find it uneven. Like I said, I'm not trying to compare the old with the new. I just think in and of itself it's a bit bland, and dare I say it, boring.\n", "val": 7.212936907308176e-05}

{"text": "Got an early copy, just before my first Vegas trip. I can see how some Killers fans, on first listen, will be disappointed. It's all over the place, & yeah it does have some country overtones (thankfully).But I haven't listened to anything else for the last five days. I think he's a maturing songwriter who's branching out into new subjects, especially religion. In \"Playing With Fire,\" when he sings, \"This church of mine may not be recognized by steeple/ But that doesn't mean that I will walk without a God,\" that knocked me out. Amen, brother.What I can't figure out is why the best song on the album, \"The Clock Was Ticking,\" is a bonus track. It's a witty & sad mini-epic about a high-school sweetheart love affair inspired, I'm guessing, by the death of his mother from cancer. Incidentally, I found \"Tidal Wave\" to be the best Killers track ever, and it ended up a bonus track, so I guess some artists don't even know what they've got, sometimes.My take--it's a bit subtler, & more nuanced, than other Killers albums, but well worth your time. And it's the same voice, rich w/ gorgeous vocal inflections, as always. If you're dead-set on another Hot Fuss, skip it. But you'll be missing out.\n", "val": 0.008669734001159668}

{"text": "By now most fans know the story. After many years on tour the other Killers needed a long vacation; Brandon however didn't. This album was never about establishing a proper solo career. It's simply the work of an artist who loves making music, and wanted to continue refining his craft. Many reviewers in the press have criticized Flamingo for not being different enough from The Killers. As I say regarding all Killers records, please don't compare them against each other, each is a seperate work with its own beauty and merits.With that said, Flamingo is a solid effort from start to finish. Though Flamingo has many similarities with the Killers, there's also notable departures. Of course it's much more subdued, less bombastic absent the other bandmates great guitars and drums. It's also at times more mainstream, less alternative without those selfsame guitars and drums. But what Flamingo does have is Brandon Flowers unique talent as a singer and songwriter. This is probably most evident on songs like 'Crossfire', where who else could sing about the \"crossfire between heaven and hell\" with a simple, yet meaningful, mellifluous chorus of \"lay your body down, lay your body down, lay your body down...\" The lyricism continues prominently in songs Was it Something I Said, Magdalena, Playing with Fire, where Brandon weaves talented vocals with strong storytelling. The best melodies come in \"Only the Young\" and \"Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts\", two songs that should be singles releases. Flamingo also has some more personal, dustier experimentation. Tracks like \"On the Floor\" (a gospel track akin to early Elvis) and \"Swallow It\" (with its funky introspection). There is a distinct duet with female singer Jenny Lewis on \"Hard Enough\", which could also be a single, and of course the glitzy intro \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\". The three producers lends a lot of variation within Flamingo; from dusty, to dancefloor modern, to in between; giving the album a feel that it's all over the place, yet still of high quality and always personal. Taken on its own merits, the record presents a full journey and only gets better with multiple listens.Flamingo can be somewhat of a slow-grower, but there really is not a bad track here. I would recommend it to most Killers fans, and anyone who likes Brandon Flowers. Listen to a few of the live performances on youtube if you need to get a feel. Also for those getting the album, I would highly recommend the \"deluxe edition\" as it's only a little more, but bears some excellent additional tracks.\n", "val": 0.010531969368457794}
{"text": "I was, like many, very curious of The Killers' Brandon Flowers solo effort. We've heard the music he's made and written for the group but `Flamingo' is his opportunity to define himself as a solo artist apart from the group. If you're wondering if his style and musical preference is really any different from that of the group, don't worry. It's both the albums' strength and weakness: most of the music on `Flamingo' sounds very much like the music you'd expect from The Killers. If you listen to this album without the knowledge that this is meant to be a solo record for Flowers, you'd think this was just another The Killers release. In a way, I was pleased with the album overall because The Killers and Flowers are known for some very unique music that harkens back to Springsteen, Lou Reed and Bob Dylan. On the other hand, I was let down because I saw this as Flowers' opportunity to be challenged as a writer and musical artist and experiment. Still, `Flamingo' has its high points and makes for a decent solo debut.The Good: The best part of the album is the second half. The last half of the features tracks where Flowers ventures away from the style and sound that's come to define The Killers and experiments a bit with different instrumentation and beats. \"Magdalena\" is the first track that really caught my attention from the album. Flowers said that the track itself was inspired by a pilgrimage a group of faithful make to a town in Mexico. Even though the subject feels random, he sounds more connected to this song than the others. Other stand out tracks were \"Crossfire\" with its western flair with a rock vibe; \"On the Floor\" that sounds like a song from the `50s and `60s that features Flowers' great ability to pen lyrics that capture a moment and fully describes it with great details while evoking emotion through his unique vocal style; \"Swallow It\", while sounding suggestive, has Flowers being a bit sensual as he advises a woman who's in over her head take her time and stick to her guns rather than giving up.The Bad: The first half of the album was a bit dull in my opinion. It sounds too much like unreleased tracks from The Killers and didn't do much to define Flowers as a solo artist. I was also taken back by how Brandon Flowers chose to release a solo album of music that feels very safe and expected. Yes, he's a songwriter and the image and brains behind The Killers but I felt this solo album was his chance to stand out a bit and do some songs that The Killers would never do as a group. I was shocked that most of the experimentation and chances were taken on tracks left as \"bonus\" extras for the deluxe edition. In my opinion, the tracks like \"The Clock Was Tickin' \" and \"Jacksonville\" should have been included on the standard edition rather than tracks like \"Playing with Fire\" or \"Hard Enough\" which felt like leftover tracks from The Killers. At the end of the day, I'm on the fence about the album. Of the standard edition tracks, half of them feel inspired and interesting while others feel like leftovers from The Killers' albums. I wish Flowers had taken more chances with his music; the album feels very safe. He doesn't stray far from the type of music or style that's made The Killers a hit band. That's ok, I'm sure many fans will be delighted that `Flamingo' offers up a slew of Killers-worthy tracks. However, with this being a solo album, it seemed like a great opportunity for him to define himself as a solo artist. Perhaps he could have taken more chances with the lyrics; I personally think he could have experimented a bit more with the music and instrumentation backing. I was let down by the fact that producer Stuart Price, the guy behind Madonna's `Confessions on a Dancefloor', Kylie Minogue's `Aphrodite' and most recently the Scissor Sisters' `Night Work' album wasn't able to really take Flowers into any new musical directions. He did wonders for these other artists but his usual synth and mixing style seems absent or subdued on `Flamingo'. If you get the album, definitely spring for the deluxe edition: the bonus tracks add more to the album in terms of variety, style and experimentation.Listen to These: \"On the Floor\", \"Jacksonville\", \"The Clock Was Tickin'\", \"Welcome to Las Vegas\"\n", "val": 0.011018388904631138}

{"text": "Even when Brandon Flowers makes mistakes on \"Flamingo,\" his intriguing solo debut, they are extremely interesting mistakes.With his quivering yet authoritative vocals - reminiscent, in an unusual way, of the late, wonderful Roy Orbison's - he charges through this selection of unique, quirky, often quite touching set of modern, urbane singer-songwriter pop with aplomb and conviction.Proponents of Ryan Adams could credibly postulate that Flowers is perhaps taking some of Adams' artistic eccentricities and sprucing them up for a more palatable audience, but nonetheless...Lead single \"Crossfire\" has earned critical repute and deserves far more radio success than it has thus far achieved. The poetic, effervescent lyrics and hopelessly scintillating (and purely catchy) chorus make the song an instant hit. Other potential hits exist in \"Hard Enough,\" a gorgeous, lyrically eloquent mid-tempo ballad co-written and co-performed with Jenny Lewis, whose expressive voice gels extremely well with Flowers'. The cathartic, prayerful \"On the Floor\" sounds as weightless as it does profoundly beautiful.There are many intriguing misfires (perhaps `misfires' is too harsh a word) on the album as well. The bubbly, perky, 80s-styled \"Was It Something I Said?\" sounds like guttural Americana and retro bubble gum at the same time, but, much like the overlong, cliched \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas,\" it takes a long time to not quite catch its groove, sounding more like a very interesting idea for a song than a finished one.Even the promising \"Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts\" is sprawling and in need of restraint, despite its urgent production and excellent display of Flowers' vocal range. It has a common problem for the record - Flowers' excesses as a song writer have not been reigned in. The songs are often overlong and in need of more focus. Perhaps this has to do with his going it alone without his Killers bandmates. Perhaps this has to do with Island Records giving him creative carte blanche for the project. Perhaps both.Even Tolstoy needed an editor.The more forgettable material is still well-oiled due to Flowers' compelling, driving vocals and fine production work from Daniel Lanois, Brendan O'Brien and Stuart Price.\"Flamingo\" may not be an artistic triumph, but it is nothing to sneer at, either. Flowers is a quirky, brooding, highly inventive young artist, and while he is reminiscent of other performers (it is difficult not to be) he has a distinct sound of his own, even irrespective of the Killers, that he is beginning to hone quite well. It is a hell of a lot more interesting to hear an artist stumble a bit trying for something real and original than simply doing what has come before, and Flowers fulfills that desire. He is worth far more than a passing glance.(The bonus tracks were clearly left off the album for a reason - from the folksy, beat-poetry-like \"The Clock Was Tickin'\" and the atmospheric, pillow-padded, downbeat \"Jacksonville,\" these tunes would have diffused the atmosphere of the standard album were they included on it. They are inventive, idiosyncratic and worthwhile for the above-average fan or completest.)\n", "val": 0.004639731254428625}
{"text": "New life has been breathed into the art of contemporary instrumental guitar with the first solo album of original material from veteran guitarist and composer Shambhu, aka Neil Vineberg. (Shambhu has a long list of impressive credits, having performed with Narada Michael Walden, Carlos Santana, and Clarence Clemons and recorded with Whitney Houston.)Sacred Love is one of the most beautiful and most impressive guitar albums I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. One of the photographs on the CD, of Shambhu smiling meekly with his hand over his heart, might lead listeners to think that they are about to hear a collection of ponderous instrumental musings typically associated with New Age music. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But this is not that album. (Incidentally, the photograph is appropriate in that it conveys the sense of the music coming from Shambhu's heart and making its way into those of listeners, which it does).The CD is brimming with masterfully played, boundary-crossing tunes touching everything from New Age and fusion to world music and smooth jazz. In fact, several cuts are radio-friendly and would be right at home on commercial jazz stations.Shambhu wrote most of the compositions, co-wrote two or three, and plays acoustic and electric guitars. He also plays electric sitar, which reinforces the exotic Indian sounds of several tracks. This Southeast Asian influence is also reflected in the guitarist's name, a Sanskrit word meaning \"source of happiness,\" which is an apt description of his music as well. Shambhu's guitar and composing skills are comparable to those of Andy Summers, Pat Metheny, Lee Ritenour, and Larry Carlton, as well as fellow independent newcomers such as Devin Rice and Erin Aas.The rich, full sound of the CD is fleshed out by an amazing lineup of musicians, among them - to name just a very few - Tony Levin (John Lennon, Peter Gabriel, King Crimson, Andy Summers) on bass, Jeff Haynes (Pat Metheny) on percussion, Jeff Oster on flugelhorn, and Charlie Bisharat on violin, with enchanting wordless vocals provided by Claytoven Richardson and Noah Wilding. Album producer Will Ackerman of Windham Hill Records and Private Music fame also lends his guitar and piano talents separately to a couple of tracks.Sacred Love is an album that will satisfy many musical palates, not just those of guitar music fans. Shambhu is an artist to keep a close eye on. Hopefully this is the first of many more wonderful new albums to emerge from his creative vision.\n", "val": 0.04362077638506889}

It includes We'll meet again (albeit a re-recording from 1953) and White cliffs of Dover, but it in no way could truly be called the very best of Vera Lynn. It focuses mainly on her recordings from the fifties, yet even omits most of her fifties pop hits.I have several compilations of Vera's music, which between them represent her career as a recording artist from 1936 to 1977. Vera recorded for Decca (now part of Universal) until 1960, before switching to a label that is now part of EMI for the remainder of her career. In the sixties and seventies, Vera appeared regularly on TV and recorded plenty of great music during those decades, some of which is available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Singles-Collection/dp/B000MCIBIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Singles Collection</a>. However, people are primarily interested in the early half of her career so it is her Decca recordings, 20 of which are included here, that Vera will always be remembered for. Closer inspection shows that the people at Universal didn`t put a lot of thought into the track selection.Of the compilations of Vera Lynn's Decca music that I own, there are two double CD's that I particularly love. One is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Forces-Sweetheart-49-Original-Mono-Recordings-1936-1952/dp/B000HOMT26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Forces Sweetheart: 49 Original Mono Recordings 1936-1952</a>, released on the ASV label that has now been shut down. Now out of print along with all other ASV titles, it  includes 43 tracks from the period 1936 to 1945, together with six from 1951 and 1952. The other great double CD, Decca years 1936 to 1960 (not listed here), was originally released on Universal. It contains 56 tracks including some from the thirties and the war years, but mainly focuses on Vera's music of the fifties. So while there is some duplication of tracks, there isn't very much. If Universal had selected the best tracks from both compilation, I would have been very happy to give this five stars. As it turns out, this was compiled entirely from Decca years 1936 to 1960, which means that very few of these recordings are from the war years, which the compilation is supposed to commemorate.Looking at the track listing for (and listening to) Forces sweetheart, I would certainly have expected to find Wishing and A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square in any compilation that claims to be the very best of Vera Lynn. From the Decca years 1956 to 1960, I would have expected Forget-me-not, The homing waltz and My son my son, all big UK pop hits during the fifties (My son my son went all the way to number one), to have been included here. Of Vera's big hits of the fifties, there is only one  (Auf Wiederseh'n sweetheart) here, despite the preponderance of fifties recordings.There is, of course, plenty of great music here. Among the highlights are Harbour lights, which Vera recorded in March 1937 (and may well be the original artist) and Up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire, which was Vera's first recording in February 1936. There are covers of songs associated with others, including I'm forever blowing bubbles (a song that West Ham fans know well), As time goes by, When I grow too old to dream and Faraway places. Vera sings them all superbly, but I wouldn't have included them at the expense of the omitted songs that I mentioned.As a sample of Vera's music, this is great but could have been better, hence only 4 stars. Still, I'm pleased that it has proved popular. If nothing else, it shows that there is still plenty of interest in Vera's music and not just among older people. Following the success of this compilation, a 5-CD budget boxed set&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gold-100-Songs-From-A-Life-In-Music/dp/B002TL66OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gold: 100 Songs From A Life In Music</a>&nbsp;was released in December 2009.

{"text": "Perhaps I was born in the wrong era. I love 40's music and my favorite is Vera Lynn, especially \"We'll Meet Again.\" Her voice resonates. It has range. It's strong and beautiful. No matter which song you listen to, you can't help but be enthralled with the voice of a woman who was still giving concerts in Amsterdam in 1985 at the age of 78. The Dutch still love her. (That's right-still). Dame Vera Lynn is still alive at age 97.Her songs were perhaps the most poignant during World War II. \"We'll Meet Again\" suggests the joy and tragedy of war as the words imply that the the serviceman will return to the joy and romance of true love or that true love will only be renewed in the afterlife if he didn't return. Her voice adds to the hope that the end of war brings, and the despair of it ending with loss and grief. Choruses are a frequent part of her songs. Choruses, especially in wartime, convey a sense of community, even if the songs are individual and romantic \"from the time you say good-bye.\"Unfortunately, I don't think this is the VERY best of this artist. \"I'll Be Seeing You\" is not on this album, nor is \"Lili Marlene,\" which was popular with the German as well as British troops. Nevertheless many more songs on this album are sure to relieve some stress and add some melancholy.\n", "val": 0.026445090770721436}

Surely, they can obtain colour images somewhere?If I had to choose what cd of hers I prefer, I would pick 'Singles Collection', as that contains more songs and more romantic tracks and 2 cds.Vera is a beautiful singer.

{"text": "This \"very best of\" Vera Lynn compilation CD has much to offer although as another reviewer, Mr. Harris, notes there are songs that really should have been included instead of a few of the songs we get here. For example, while we get standards like \"We'll Meet Again\" and \"(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover,\" \"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\" and \"My Son My Son,\" Vera's number-one hit from the 1950s, are just not here!  On the bright side again, however, Vera's voice is as clear as a bell on this entire album; and you'll enjoy that when you hear these ballads and songs all performed with panache and genuine emotion. These songs showcase Vera's talent very well. The quality of the sound is very good and the artwork is nicely done.\"(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover\" starts the album off with a marvelous, ageless song that Vera sings faultlessly. I like that piano arrangement and it all holds its own very well. \"Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart\" is certainly very easy on the ear; and \"We'll Meet Again\" charms me with its natural beauty. I love it!\"As Time Goes By\" from the movie \"Casablanca\" gets the royal treatment from Vera Lynn who delivers this without letting go of a single superfluous note. The lush musical arrangement enhances this ballad even more; and I also really like Vera's rendition of \"Dream.\" \"Dream\" is one of my favorite numbers on this CD. \"Faraway Places\" is also quite well done; and Vera does a superb version of \"If You Love Me\" which I first heard sung in French and English by Edith Piaf. Piaf would have certainly approved of Vera's treatment of this poignant love song!\"The Loveliest Night of the Year\" is wonderful; I could never tire of listening to Vera Lynn sing this splendid tune! \"Wish Me Luck as You Wave Me Goodbye\" is another classic that Vera delivers passionately; and there's yet another gem when Vera sings \"When I Grow Too Old to Dream.\" I think you'll like \"When I Grow Too Old to Dream\" very much.There's a stunning medley of \"Somewhere Along The Way;\" \"Here In My Heart\" and  \"Let The Rest Of The World Go By;\" Vera's singing makes these songs sound so new and fresh while the backup singers harmonize to perfection--and beyond! Of course, Vera never really needed backup, but they do sound good. The album ends with two magnificent numbers: \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\" and \"From the Time You Say Goodbye (The Parting Song).\" What a terrific way to end this CD!Vera Lynn will never be forgotten; and I share Mr. Harris' hopes that more of her music will be re-released for us to enjoy over and over again. This album is a must have for Vera Lynn fans even if it isn't truly a \"best of\" single CD compilation; there's not a single dud in the bunch here.

Out of curiosity I bought it and it's arrived. Nice CD. Good singer. Good sound ... the earliest recordings show their age but only slightly  (occasional quiet crackles, but nothing intrusive). The notes give no recording date details, but it appears that over half of the tracks are post-WWII recordings (though nothing newer than 1953), including a re-recording of \"We'll Meet Again.\"  I do like this enough to go looking for that compilation (\"Forces Sweetheart\") recommended by another reviewer here, Mr. Harris (Thank you!).

{"text": "It is very hard to believe but nearly 35 years since John Lennon was violently murdered, and the world lost a musical giant. His songs still stand taller on broad hearts and souls stronger than most of today's music. He had made some of the most brilliant music ever to come out of radio, they came from the heart. John had a lot of songs from the beginning to the end of his life all over that honestly had a lot to say from the soul. Woman is honestly one of those songs that I absolutely love of his career. It is truthfully one of those songs that really captures the soul so emotionally, and one of the last songs he had recorded before John passed on. It really says so much with a lot of meaning in the heart, and really worth the song each and every time you listen to it. If you have never heard a John Lennon song before, than I sincerely recommend you have Woman in your music library and the heart of John Lennon.Song: B+\n", "val": 0.04756089299917221}

Granted, there have been many outstanding lyrics written by him as a Beatle either individually or in partnership with Paul - both ballads like 'If I Fell' to the deep lyrics of 'A Day In The Life', etc, but Imagine seems to say so much in so easy to understand words ...... thoughts about mankind, sharing, love, harmony, life the way John may have wished it could be and should be...... Imagine has been copied by many other artists and is probably the most 'popular' or 'covered' songs done during 'Beatle Week' on American Idol.  Just about every year one of the Idol hopefuls is singing Imagine - the best, in my opinion, by David Archuletta.  Outside of Idol, I've heard even Charlotte Church sing it during a charity concert - she did it in her usual high soprano voice but the lyrics and meaning came out powerful and clear, just the way John wrote them.  A classic song by one of music's lyrical genuises......\n", "val": 0.023682065308094025}

Undoubtedly this is a great decision, not only because it gives us the fantastic tracks on SMA, but also because it doesn't beat the video game theme into the ground.

For example, the X-men song has one part where they go to an acoustic type sound for a couple measures but thats it.  They could have added a lot more of things like that rather than RAH RAH RAH the whole time (so to speak).Favorite tracks are Xmen and Winnie the Pooh.

{"text": "Powerglove's new album, Saturday Morning Apocalypse, came out the 28th. The teaser tracks were crazy good. It's like they're on a quest to make everything I get nostalgic about from my younger days EPIC, constructed from the finest METAL. \"Heffalumps and Woozles\" gets my vote for the most bizarrely badass cover of a Winnie the Pooh song in recorded history- and it will likely retain that title for quite some time. It's probably one of the best tracks on the album, but there is so much WIN on it, it's really hard to make that assessment. Powerglove gets my vote for \"Best Cover Band of All Time\", though Northern Kings could give them a run for their money. Speaking of which, Tony Kakko, who is in Northern Kings, (not to mention Sonata Arctica) sings the vocals in \"Gotta Catch 'Em All\". The irony of it all is that I wasn't overly fond of some of the original songs, but they still remind me of fond memories nonetheless- and Powerglove's take on the music doesn't hurt things, either. If you have memories of eating cereal and watching cartoons on saturday mornings, and are a fan of metal (particularly power metal), you owe yourself this album. You'll thank yourself for it later.\n", "val": 0.019612472504377365}

And it really is good music, with lyrics that can touch the heart of a parent and at the same time make kids move and dance and laugh.  We have since purchased other Movers cds and surely enjoy them as well, but there is something really powerful about this album that just stands alone and makes me happy as a parent to have this to share with my kids.Song styles on the cd range from jigs to rock to hip hop to Hawaiian --and yet the whole thing flows so well; the band's eclectic musicality flavored with general good-guy quirkiness oddly reminds me of the band Phish in its early days.  Insert well written child-focused lyrics and positive themes and you've got parental gold.

The repertoire includes familiar faves by the Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Hillman's old Desert Rose Band, and an old Louvin Brothers tune or two.

{"text": "There really is no such thing as a bad Johnny Mathis album.  Yet there are those albums that stand out more than others. \"Let It Be Me: Mathis in Nashville\" in one such album.Mathis sticks to familiar Country & Western classics so most fans will be familiar with most of the songs on this CD.  At the same time, the songs sound refreshingly new.  It must be said, however, that arranger Matthew McCauley's string arrangements coupled with some of the best musicians in Nashville give Mathis some of the best support he's had in years.While it is difficult to pick a favorite song, several stand out.  \"We Must Be Lovin' Right\" is the perfect easy mid-tempo love song and the newest song on the entire CD.  Mathis sounds positively lovelorn on the Eddy Arnold chestnut \"You Don't Know Me.\" The traditional \"Shenandoah\" has an arrangement that weaves in a portion of Dvorak's \"Going Home\" from the 9th Symphony; Mathis sings it with such authority that you wonder why he waited so long to record it.Pour yourself a glass of wine, sit back and just let this one play from start to finish.

{"text": "Some may think that it is a stretch for Johnny Mathis to sing country music, but they would be wrong.  The music on this CD feels new and familiar at the same time.  No one sings about love quite like Johnny, and that's what these classic country songs are about.  Whether it is about love of a special someone, (\"Crazy\", \"Let It Be Me\", \"Make the World Go Away\", \"We Must Be Lovin Right\"), of a special place, (\"Shenandoah\"), or of the whole world, (\"What a Wonderful World\"), Johnny puts his classic spin on these songs, and you may have an \"aha!\" moment, wondering why he hadn't recorded these sooner.My only complaint about this CD is that \"What a Wonderful World\" appears twice on the CD, a \"regular\" version and a \"Christmas\" version.  The \"Christmas\" version has bells and strains of \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" in the background to suggest a Christmas mood.  In my opinion, to try to pass of \"What a Wonderful World\" as a Christmas song seems just a bit insulting to the intelligence, especially given that Johnny is a maestro of Christmas music. \"What a Wonderful World\" is not even a country song, and it is given two spots on a country music CD.  (Although Willie Nelson did do a recording of the song).Actually, I felt that \"We Must Be Lovin Right\", has a natural \"New Year's Eve\" feeling to it, and probably should be included on a future Christmas album.All in all, it is still a great CD, and I would highly recommend it.\n", "val": 0.0010965237161144614}

{"text": "This title from one of his first albumns some 50 plus years ago could easily be the subtitle for Johnny's latest cd.  It features great music, the playing and arranging are tremendous.  Needless to say Johnny is in fine voice at 75 years old he sounds soooo smooth and even at times youthful as in the little giggle you hear at the end of his singing in Southern Nights.  He does a great version of this one.  Shenandoah is incredible alot of feeling in this one as in Loving Arms.  The standrds such as Make The world Go Away, Crazy, I Can't stop Loving You and Love Me Tender stand up to the originals but of course with Johnny's magical voice receive special care in his rendering of them. What A Wonderful World has been done by everyone but again Johnny shines in his rendition.  Saving my favorite for last... George Strait's We Must Be Lovin' Right is so good, smooth like velvet.  He seems to sing it as easily as he breathes and in my estimation is the standout song here.  I think much thought and planning went into the production from Johnny, his people and the muscians and arrangers in Nashville.  I have been listening to Johnny for many years even though he began before I was born (1957) and he is truly one of my favorites.  He does deserve more accolades than he gets, but perhaps he receives his due in his longevity, continuous fans and his timeless ageless voice that have brought pleasure to millions over the years.  I hope he keeps it up and continues to favor us with more.  You will not be disappointed with this cd.  Listen to it 3 or 4 times and you won't be able to stop.

{"text": "Johnny Mathis has always been a masterful artist; and he continues to perform outstandingly well as he sings these country and country-styled ballads on this album. He sounds just great; his voice is not at all worn from age--instead Johnny sounds more \"cool\" and sophisticated than ever. His sense of timing, his phrasing and his excellent diction all combine to make each and every song he sings memorable. Johnny also does some admirable work on this album with both Lane Brody and Alison Krauss; and that's grand. The quality of the sound is terrific and I like that artwork as well.There isn't anything that's less than perfect here; every song's a winner and just one listen proves it! The CD opens with Johnny Mathis and Lane Brody doing a sublime rendition of \"What a Wonderful World;\" they perform this passionately and they never let go of a single superfluous note! \"Let It Be Me\" is another gem that shines bright when Johnny does it with Alison Krauss; this has a fantastic arrangement that charms me every time I hear it. In addition, listen for Johnny Mathis to sing \"Make The World Go Away\" with panache; and I really like all the other songs including \"Crazy;\" \"Southern Nights;\" the gorgeous \"You Don't Know Me\" that has Johnny singing to perfection--and beyond; \"Lovin' Arms;\" \"Shenandoah\" with that fine arrangement; \"We Must Be Lovin' Right\" which is another stunning tune that uses the strings to great advantage; \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" with Johnny singing yet again at his very best; the timeless \"Love Me Tender\" with some excellent guitar work as Johnny sings the lyrics; \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\" and a strikingly beautiful Christmas rendition of \"What a Wonderful World\" that Johnny Mathis performs with Lane Brody.Johnny Mathis is clearly one of the greatest entertainers of all time; and it's terrific to know he's still \"got it.\" In addition, Lane Brody and Alison Krauss make fine contributions to this album. I highly recommend this for Johnny Mathis fans everywhere; and people who like Lane Brody, Alison Krauss and country music with a helping of easy listening thrown in will not be disappointed!\n", "val": 0.05046578496694565}
{"text": "I was a bit skeptical about this recording, as I'm an enormous fan of Mathis' years where he wasn't simply doing popular covers of songs (i.e., recordings such as \"I'm Coming Home\" and the inexplicably unreleased on CD or MP3, \"Mathis Is....\", both produced by the king of Philly sound, Thom Bell, as well as the dynamic \"The Best Years Of My Life\" (not the least of which is the unparalleled duet with Mathis' most perfect duet partner, Jane Olivor)) but Mathis (at what, 74 years old recording this) is as silken and smooth as ever.  If the astonishing long notes Mathis is so famous for aren't here, no matter -- it's just a direct, heartfelt, effortless, and elegant recording (backed in part by the luminous Alison Krauss on the title track), and I believe Vince Gill is in the mix at times as well.  I believe this recording was done live in Nashwille with the musicians, rather than Johnny piping it in from Los Angeles (and the Mathis self-multi-tracked harmonies at certain points are wonderful, wonderful indeed).To sum it up, all you have to do is go right to go right to the track, \"Shenandoah\".  Personally, I had tears running down my face when I first heard this, and it's one of the most beautiful, elegiac (as is much of this recording) recordings by Mathis or anyone else, ever.Johnny, please come to New York City (as in Manhattan, not New Jersey or the outside boroughs) -- I wasn't living here yet, but I flew in for your Carnegie Hall debut, and you'll always hold the deepest place in my heart.  (oh, Sony Legacy =- please get on the ball and release the Mathis Chic-produced great lost recording, \"I Love My Lady\" -- what's the point of keeping it in the vaults?)\n", "val": 0.03148562088608742}

{"text": "It first looked like a 50s-60s Sony Legacy reissue: minor at best, cheesy at worst.  Johnny Mathis, for most of 55 years the smooth, suave crooner covering everyone from Ellington to Diane Warren and working with producer/arrangers from Percy Faith to Gamble/Huff, sings countrypolitan standards posing in front of a red barn and green field right out of a \"Real McCoys\" colorized rerun.Yet \"Let It Be Me,\" one of only three new, non-holiday releases from Mathis this last decade,  proves the timelessness of these classic country hits and of Mathis' tender singing. The set list lends itself to overdramatization and, at worst, parody: \"Crazy\" and \"Love Me Tender\" are iconic performances by Patsy Cline and Elvis Presley, while Ray Charles rendered \"You Don't Know Me,\" and \"I Can't Stop Lovin' You\" as two of the most heartbroken ballads in his canon. (They became oily and tossed-off in Jerry Vale and Frank Sinatra's respective hands, and Dean Martin hit with this stuff only in Jimmy Bowen's quasi 50's ballad arrangements.)But Mathis rests his delicate delivery on a warm bed of strings for each song, with vocals astonishingly close to the ones singing \"Misty,\" \"Chances Are,\" and his other classics pondering the opening moments of new romance. Mathis wisely brings this romantic singing view to his readings of Hank Locklin's \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\" and his gentle duet \"Let It Be Me\" with Allison Krauss (who shows some versatility after raising sand two years ago with that other high-voiced, rock and roll romantic icon on their hit album.) You might not ever want to hear another version of \"What A Wonderful World\"; Louis Armstrong's gruff, knowing vocals could have rendered the song ironic but instead made it one about resilience. But Mathis does a perfectly capable, low-drama version, finding joy in nature, children growing, and small moments more easily noticed in the country (and heard in country-western).Among the casinos and theaters Mathis has played are more recent stops in Branson, MO, a preservation zone of sorts for country-pop music twice-removed by outlaw and Nash Vegas variations on the genre. \"Let It Be Me\" keeps steel guitars to a minimum, eschews overwrought vocals completely, and lets an old-pro romantic singer do what his does best, country-style. Highly recommended for Mathis fans.\n", "val": 0.005275582894682884}

You will find Michael Gira and his \"Angels of Light\" and just the end of last year you get to hear Jarboe with Neurosis(the 2 making a perfect collaboration) and many solo albums and projects along the way for both Jarboe and Michael Gira.The music of Swans in this album is so warm. Swans become the warmth of the darkness. Never a cold and lonely place to be.

That's the spirit of the symbolism here, the true feeling of nothing left and the questioning of all dreams and hope.

These are the songs Mrs. Cash would sing after deciding he did the right thing.  They'd sit in the dark, and wait for God's judgment. Melodramatic? Sure, but I'm tellin' you...\"Various Failures\" showcases Swans in their Old Testament folk-rock period.  After the first several releases, they moved away from death-march discord into more conventional music.  There's easily more wrath and despair in Swans than in any other band I've heard.  Michael Gira sings of a world where human life has no value (\"Was He Ever Alive?\", \"Failure,\" \"The Childs Right\") and the only effective diversion is devouring the weak.  Jarboe is the queen of oblivion ballads (\"Song for Dead Time,\" \"When She Breathes,\" \"I Remember Who You Are\").This album, along with 1996's \"Soundtracks for The Blind,\" makes me wonder if there wasn't some actual possession going on; it couldn't ALL be done through vivid imagination alone.  The stories are so intense, the music so skillful, and the cd packaging so inspired that \"Various Failures\" remains a powerful example of Swans in its middle age.

Eerie breathing and disembodied electronic barking add another layer of unease; this song makes your hair stand on end. If the Edvard Munch painting The Scream was given a voice, this is exactly what it would sound like.For merciful contrast, there are gentle ballads with beautiful melodies like The Golden Boy that was Swallowed by the Sea sung by Mike and Jarboe's The Other Side of the World and the achingly beautiful I Remember Who You Are where her voice excels as a vehicle of tenderness, empathy and hope.On the eerie number Her, Michael's lullaby like introduction is followed by a harsh, atonal & intrusive rock riff that gives way to the voice of a teenage girl talking about summer, her boyfriend Charlie, the Atlanta International & Monterrey pop festivals, musicians like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Janis-Joplin/dp/0805053948/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Janis Joplin</a>, The Who, Johnny Rivers and The Grateful Dead, with period radio commercials and static noise in the background.Michael sings The Child's Right, a desolate ballad about death and decay with hints of religious imagery and Blind that sounds like a take from the Burning World sessions. A moving melancholic ballad, it deals with one of his favorite subjects, alcoholism in lines like\" \"Because when I'm drinking, I'm out of control/No I was never young, and nothing has transpired/And when I look in the mirror, I feel dead, I feel cold, I am blind.\"This much abbreviated version of The Most Unfortunate Lie is deceptively titled \"instrumental,\" as it does contain a few lines of Michael's vocals and the spectral children's voices.This disc's total running time is 75:52.2 RED DISCThis one opens with Michael's harrowing Failure and is followed by Identity, another strange one with a little boy reciting a weird spiritual poem over riffs rife with minor-chords and snatches of distorted male vocal.Breathtaking is the word for their interpretation of Steve Winwood's Can't Find My Way Home, hypnotically and spookily sung by Jarboe over eerie instrumentation.

A cursory glance at Jonson's lyrics reveals nothing overtly spiritual; the theme seems to be romantic love.

Turn Your Back On Me -  grade: B+  - alternative/rock. not a great song but it is pretty damn good. again, more alternative style. not as great as 2, 3, 5, and 10 but better than 1 and 6.13. Ad Hominem -  grade: D-  - pop-rock. we accepted rapping in Let Them Eat War - Empire Strikes First, but this is ridiculous. silly lyrics, nice music, but the singing is completely worthless. if they play this live then that is my cue to get beat up in the mosh pit...actually i doubt anyone will mosh to this -rather than raid the stage to take the mic away from Greg. Horrible! (sounds like Red Hot Chili Peppers - not good for BR - dislike- but not as much as Pride and Pallor.14. Where The Fun Is - grade: B-  - slow rock. reminds me of Infected(music-wise)and The Empire Strikes First (singing style). not bad, but not one of their goodies. the fun is not in this song but i guess I'll stick around. (sorry for the lame comments).15. I Won't Say Anything - grade: A+  - slow. amazing slow Brett/Greg genius. this is one of my other favorites. i love it. nice and slow, but great BR lyrics and new music.------------------Japanese/EU release----------i got my digital copy by ordering the CD from the BR site - the deluxe edition of this albums release which comes with Finite(below) and 4 live tracks: generator, how much is enough, pessimistic lines, and best for you.16. Finite - grade: A  - slow, more rock/alternative. another amazing slow song. its the new BR style which fits this album, compared to the rest. sounds like something i have heard before, but it doesn't anger me. i like it. :)that is it, but this is just me throwing words down on how i take this album(after listening to it from myspace for a week (day in and day out) and getting the pre-ordered CD early from the bands distributor). this song could easily been a Generator type release - only 11 songs and it would have been an instant classic.\n", "val": 0.010462413541972637}

Among these is \"Cyanide\", the best song on the album, which is a bit of a departure from the normal Bad Religion sound (think \"Prodigal Son\" from New Maps of Hell meets Greg Graffin's solo album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cold-As-the-Clay/dp/B000FMGTXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cold As the Clay</a>), but with brilliant lyrics and a hook that will give a serious case of earworm. Other great tunes of this nature are \"I Won't Say Anything\" (and its completely identical sound-alike \"Turn Your Back on Me\") and the first single \"The Devil in Stitches\". \"Where the Fun Is\" is another great song from Brett Gurewitz, with plenty of oomph behind it, and vocal harmonies that serve to make the song harsher, as opposed to softening it.There are a few lackluster songs on the album, though. \"Won't Somebody\" is an old acoustic tune that was given more backing, but the song is a bit too bland, especially compared with the high-level music that is found everywhere else on the album. Additionally, \"The Day That the Earth Stalled\" is a bit of a confusing tune, that blasts unusual chord structures and lyrics past the listener before they have time to properly digest them, and you're left with the sense of \"what did I just listen to?\" Lastly, \"Pride and the Pallor\" feels like something ripped directly out of their mediocre&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-New-America/dp/B00004SW60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The New America</a>&nbsp;album; it tries to be a good song with a sophisticated structure, but doesn't know how. Still, 12 good songs out of 15 is a success rate many other groups would be very happy to claim.As other bands age, there's always a fear that their music will start to slide downhill. Bad Religion has, somehow, found the energy to make their music better and better as time goes on, and 30 years on, The Dissent of Man is more than worthy of inclusion in one of the best music catalogs in history. If you like punk music, or if you're just a fan of music that rocks hard but is well written, you need to pick this album up; if you're a Bad Religion fan, this should be a no-brainer. You will not be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.009468269534409046}

{"text": "After 30 years Bad Religion proved they haven't lost a step or their creative edge with this release. TDOM retains all hallmarks of the Bad Religion sound: driving beat, wall of sound guitars, poppy melodies and Greg Graffin's clear but raucous vocals. While maintaining their signature sound, the melodies and riffs on the songs of this album are original and fresh. No recycled music here.You can tell the band really worked hard to make the album melodic and memorable with songs like Wrong Way Kids which is already a classic: begins with a bursting guitar solo and then the guitars build that signature BR wall of sound repeating a simple, awesome sounding chord progression. The song features maybe the most poppy chorus the band has ever done but it really fits well with the bittersweet, nostalgic lyrics. Greg is singing about the early days when the band were still kids.Devil In Stiches is another pop song that strikes an emotional core in the listener. Epic lyrics, soaring vocals with lots of oohs and ahhs and a great riff.Only Rain, The Resist Stance and Pride & The Pallor are very well done, memorable, straight forward rockers.Bad Religion continue to expand and experiment with their songwriting.

{"text": "Many previous reviewers have thoroughly dissected this album, so I'm not going to resort to ad nauseum redundancy. However, suffice it to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this offering by Bad Religion. As a youngster, albums such as SUFFER and AGAINST THE GRAIN were what I considered to be the quintessential Bad Religion sound. After about 2000 or 2001, Bad Religion pretty much fell off of my radar - until recently.I happened to pick up DISSENT OF MAN purely by default; a big, corporate bookstore was in the death throes of a \"going-out-of-business\" sale, and I happed to find this CD in the bargain bin for $4. I figured \"what the Hell, even if there are only a couple of good songs on this thing, it's still worth it at that price.\"Perhaps more than anything, it pleases me to know that even after 30+ years, this band is still able to write catchy, riveting music that I truly enjoy. Granted, I tend to favor the faster songs on the album (e.g., THE DAY THE EARTH STALLED, THE RESIST STANCE, AVALON, etc.), but I can also appreciate the band's attempts at more diversity with songs like TURN YOUR BACK ON ME and WON'T SAY ANYTHING. These aforementioned songs may be a bit on the filler side of things, but they're not abjectly horrible. Plus, Greg Graffin's vocals have sort of an \"ear worm\" catchiness to them; I'll be doing dishes or something, and catch myself singing bits of the chorus to some of the \"secondary\" songs. Some punk rock elitists may scoff at this, but really, I'm sure that after so many years, Bad Religion has little desire to be pigeon-holed into a myopic niche.It's not the greatest record that they've ever put out, but it isn't bad either. Rumor has it that they may be putting out their final album in 2012. I'll be purchasing it when it comes out.\n", "val": 0.007042131386697292}

{"text": "I really love Bad Religion. I saw them in Calgary in 2009 and was third from the front. Greg Graffin pointed at me several times. I remember during American Jesus, the guy next to me put his arm around me as we shouted the lyrics out. That was a seriously amazing time.2010 would have been an awesome music year. Iron Maiden, my favorite band, put out their best album yet: The Final Frontier. In other news, Avenged Sevenfold released the half-assed Nightmare, Linkin Park continued their downfall with A Thousand Suns, and then this. Now I'll admit I did half expect this from Bad Religion- Everything after The Gray Race disappointed me (minus The Process of Belief and a few tracks from Empire).The Day The Earth Stalled is a nice, fast paced opener, although it could have been longer. 3/5Only Rain is easily the best track off the album and the closest to the Bad Religion I love. Great lyrics too. 5/5Resist Stance is reminiscent of Suffer, so I like it a lot, plus Greg sounds awesome! 4/5Won't Somebody- OK now this is where the album takes a nosedive. This could have been in a Tim Horton's commercial, it is that bland. 2/5The Devil in Stitches- Boring. 1/5Pride and the Pallor- Ditto.Wrong Way Kids has a catchy chorus and that's about it. 2/5Meeting of the Minds is a song that had potential to be great- they were going in the right direction when the did it, but they got to the chorus... what a disappointment. 3/5Someone to Believe- OK seriously this is ridiculous. I cant believe Bad Religion did this. This sounds like post Nimrod Green Day (and I don't mean that in a good way) 0/5.Avalon- HELL YES!!!!!!!!! FINALLY beneath the grime is a kickass face melter. Seriously this is why I listen to Bad Religion 5/5.Cyanide is just as good as Avalon. 5/5Turn Your Back On Me, Ad Hominem (yuck) and the last 2 tacks are all boring and bland ways to o out.In short this album is a disappointment.

{"text": "I will be honest with you, Bad Religion is my all-time favorite band and truly can do no wrong in my mind.  Therefore, it is no surprise that I give this album 5 stars.  It is just as good as I anticipated, and maybe better.  However, I can see how some closed-minded people could be disillusioned by it.  And by that I mean people who can't stand to see a band broaden their musical horizon a bit.  Every song on here has the unmistakable, distinct Bad Religion feel, but there are a couple tracks (Cyanide, I Won't Say Anything) that is as slow as the band has ever been.  For me, this isn't a problem.  For people who want nothing but lightning fast punk rock, this might be a problem.  For me, as long as Graffin is singing a good tune and the album has a nice mixture of fast and slow, I will be a happy happy man.  Now don't get me wrong: while this is their slowest album since The New America or Recipe for Hate, there are a couple of blistering tracks: The Day The Earth Stalled shows the band in their usual fast, aggressive style.  Only Rain is very memorable and grows on you like a fungus (in a good way).  The Resist Stance starts off with an Iron Maiden-like riff and then becomes one of the faster songs on the album.  Besides the aforementioned slower tracks, this whole album carries a solid pace: not unusually fast or slow.  Absolutely not boring in the least.As far as the lyrics go, there are less multi-syllabic words, and in general is more accessible, but this doesn't make them any weaker.  There are still a lot of thought-provoking tracks, while not as overtly political as a few of their past efforts.Graffin's voice is sounding better than ever, the musicianship is great, and the production is slicker than on New Maps of Hell.  Graffin's voice isn't buried as deep in the mix.  I really can't imagine people disliking this album, but it is a fairly vast departure from New Maps of Hell, a more old-school inspired album as reminiscent of their 80's albums as any of their newer ones get.  Let's face it: if you're a true Bad Religion fan, you should love this album.  If you like only angry, dirty punk rock, some of this album may bother you.  I can definitely see this album getting more radio play than most of their other albums, and they deserve it.  Long live Bad Religion...30 more years!\n", "val": 0.023724360391497612}

The lyrics may address more than the usual boy/girl pop nonsense but so what? There's nothing new, emotionally cathartic, or of genuine musical interest in any song on the cd, just lots of LA studio perfection and showbiz professionalism.

{"text": "Though I've only discovered Bad Religion about a year ago, they've quickly moved up to being one of my favorite bands. What I like about them the most is that their CDs almost all have their own sound to them; all sound different, and all have great songs on them. With the exception of Recipe for Hate (which I just can't get into) they've never made a CD I haven't liked. This CD, too, has its own distinct sound.This CD actually reminds me a lot of New America. Not that it sounds anything like New America, but both of these CD favor very melodic songs over songs that people would consider \"fast.\" Granted, Dissent of Man has several fast, old-school style Bad Religion songs, (Most written by Greg Graffin, while a majority of Brett Gurewitz's songs are slower and a little more accoustic) but a lot of this CD finds the band at probably the most melodic I've ever heard them. Songs like Pride and the Pallor and the Devil in Stitches are almost unbelievably catchy.There are definitely great songs on here. The Resist Stance, The Wrong Way Kids, The Devil in Stitches, Only Rain, the Pride and the Pallor, Avalon...great stuff. Ad Hominem is really the only track on here that I don't like.I just wish it were all a bit faster and more energetic. Sort of reminiscent of New America, I find it a little more challenging to listen to the full CD in one nonstop session than many of the band's other works, mainly because of the slower, more melodic pace. The problem with Dissent of Man is that the CD gets off to a pretty fast start, but at the end literally grinds to a crawl as the last 5 songs are all slower, reminiscent of New America's Whisper in Time and There Will Be a Way. Again, not bad songs at all, and I love I Won't Say Anything. But the pacing of the album is definitely slowed by this ending block of songs, which I think could have been spread out more throughout the CD.My original review of The Dissent of Man was pretty vague, mainly because I wasn't sure what I thought of it. The CD has grown on me a lot more over time, and like New America, it's enjoyable and melodic, but also like New America, I just don't necessarily think it stands at the top of Bad Religion's library.\n", "val": 0.002060495549812913}
{"text": "When it comes to review an album from a band that's been there for more than 30 years, it's very hard not to compare it with previous stuff they released. Lyrically, Bad Religion has put out so many songs, that they covered every subject many times, even love. Here, it shows a lot that they tried something different lyrically, on half of the album.It sounds as if they tried to soften some of the lyrics, and the result is something that will irritate some of their fans. The softest songs here, and there are more than a couple, could have been written by any pop band around . I don't think it fits BR too well (\"Turn your back on me\" being the worst song they wrote in a decade).They still managed to pull out some fast and effective punk songs, which start the album in the same style and spirit than their last 3 albums, fast & engaging. \"Only Rain\" and \"resist stance\" being some of the best songs on the album, at least for the \"old style BR\" lovers.But the overall result is an uneven album, the last third playing softer and softer till the end of the album. It's a little sad because good songs like \"Ad Hominem\" and \"I won't say anything\" tend to get boring if they're not followed by a faster song. The last third lacks momentum and punch. It would have been a lot better if they did cut a soft song or 2 at the end, or if they added some faster ones to maintain the album's overall rythm. It feels much like The empire Strikes First, another uneven album getting slower and slower.As for the comparison with Recipe For Hate, I don't hear much resemblance apart the fact that it's much slower than the previous one. Recipe for hate was an instant classic because the slow songs had some great engaging lyrics. Not here, too bad... or not \"Bad\" enough...\n", "val": 6.54335308354348e-05}
{"text": "While their previous effort New Maps of Hell was an album filled with great fast paced songs the majority of the songs of that release was too short in duration and I felt that Graffin was not too comfortable on some songs. Maybe it was just me then.The Dissent of Man has the power to irritate some of the band's more radical fans because of the last 5 songs but there is also a good amount of remarkable songs and Graffin seems to be more loose and full of renewed energy.About THE DRUMS ->Just listen to the middle section of \"Avalon\" which is probably one of the best BR songs ever in the history of history and you'll suddenly find yourself paying attention to Brooks Wackerman's amazing drum work almost standing on top of the rest of the music. \"The Day That The Earth Stalled\" is another great example of how perfect is his drumming skills.About THE GUITARS ->There seems to be a new creative force behind the arrangements of the song and they use the 3 guitars wisely this time. Listen to the intro to \"Meeting of The Minds\" and \"Avalon\". There are some great riffs spread all around the album but both of these songs are nicely arranged with different layers of guitars. Top notch.\"The Day That The Earth Stalled\" is a great way to start. Very creative and almost sure it'll cause an accident should you be hearing it inside your car.\"Only Rain\" is an instant classic with a chorus that sticks to the brain. The combination of the inspired vocals with the background oozin-aahhs is subtle but doesn't sound forced and the guitar work is tremendously loud and trippy.\"The Resist Stance\" is one of those Graffin songs that you know it'll sound great live. It has not a defined chorus but it's one of the best of the album. Fast, furious, with a distinctive riff and one of the best vocal performances ever. It's because of songs like this one that I love this band.\"Won't Somebody\" is a song that was an acoustic bonus to the previous record and I had to hear it more than once to fully appreciate it. The chorus is addictive to say the least. Enjoyable at best.\"The Devil In Stitches\" sounds like a Mr. Brett's attempt to sound radio friendly but it's a powerful slow-paced punk rock songs with an infectious rhythm and some of his strongest lyrics since Stranger Than Fiction. The song tells a story and makes use of figurative language Brett loves to write (listen to Generator for instance).\"Pride and The Pallor\" is very creative with many different parts that make the song very interesting. A great example on how Graffin must be one of the most creative forces behind the punk rock scene. Not much to comment on the lyrics but the song is amazing.\"Wrong Way Kids\" is another instant classic. Epic with a first verse resembling their past works. It's undescribable how good Graffin sounds during the 2 minutes and 45 seconds of this fast-paced punk rock joy.\"Meeting of The Minds\". One of the greatest riffs ever. A song that I'm sure will work really great live. Perfect singing and the background vocals have found their place gracefully. Another instant classic.\"Someone To Believe\" finds Graffin comfortable to sing about what seems to be someone who finally found religion and gave up on his ideals and became blind and spoon fed with faith.\"Avalon\". No comments. This is probably the most relevant song in 2010. One of the best Bad Religion songs ever. The middle part which evolves to a guitar solo is simply perfect. The lyrics, the guitar work. 30 years later and this band is still putting a masterpiece like this one. Infectious.Now to the infamous 5 last songs. Whew, we've made it to here:\"Cyanide\" is a nice rock'n roll song with some great slide guitar playing. Very refreshing but a decade ago it'd be song that would be better included in \"No Substance\" or \"New America\". I'm not complaining, it's really good.\"Turn Your Back On Me\" is one of the two songs from this album I will skip. It's not that bad. But it's a radio friendly rock song that is subpar comparing to the first 10 songs.\"Ad Hominem\". Very nice. I love when BR does stuff like this. The verses sound a little like Red Hot's Californication and the intro riff sounds almost identical to \"Watch It Die\" from Recipe For Hate. But even though all of that it's one Graffin's outstanding rockers with a remarkable chorus. The end solo is nice too.\"Where The Fun Is\". This song grew on me. The drumming during the bridge sounds almost dance music oriented. The layers of vocals on the chorus really adds a lot. It's not outstanding but it's definitely not bad at all.The last song I will skip because I can't listen to the chorus. Even my wife which has a milder taste in music frowned. To me it's a radio-friendly little song that it's forgettable and geared towards the female fans.If you have the opportunity after buying this album, find the japanese \"deluxe edition\" CD to download or buy it if you can find it. It has \"Finite\", a masterpiece that although slower than we're used to it's one of the most creative songs that should be on the album. I can't believe they prefered \"I Won't Say Anything\" instead of \"Finite\". The guitar riffs, solos, vocals, all sound so perfect. Also there are a few live songs in the deluxe edition that are worth having if you're a big BR fan.So to sum it up I recommend this album as one of the best since Stranger Than Fiction or Recipe For Hate except a couple of stinkers. Buy this one now and you won't regret.\n", "val": 0.05926841124892235}
{"text": "After 14 studio albums, two live albums, countless singles and E.P.s, two compilations, and at least three solo albums from members, Bad Religion doesn't have anything left to prove. Particularly since they returned to their own Epitaph Records in the early 2000's, the quality of a Bad Religion release is practically guaranteed, and their fans are undoubtedly going to love every minute of it.Somewhere along the way, Bad Religion must have become aware of the level of fan confidence they have, because The Dissent of Man is amongst the bolder records they have ever offered. Sure, Dissent of Man offers some blistering fast hardcore cuts, but there are also some unexpected textures here that are clearly influenced by lead singer Greg Graffin's forays into country and folk, and the acoustic bonus tracks that were added to the Deluxe edition of their last album, New maps of Hell. In fact, the song \"Won't Somebody\" was originally released as a new acoustic song as part of that deluxe packaging, here re-imagined with an electric, full-band arrangement.In interviews included with the Live At The Paladium DVD, the members of the band revealed some of the musical artists that were influences on them through the years. The Beatles, The Beach Boys and Todd Rundgren were all listed, none of which are really that surprising when you consider BR's sound. Dissent of Man, however, adds a few unexpected names to that list via musical allusion. The opening riff of Resist Stance is a clear nod to Rush's Working Man (Greg Graffin and Brett Guerewitz's love of prog rock is well documented, but never hasn't been so clearly displayed since Into The Unknown). Pride and the Pallor could easily have come from Social Distortion's self-titled album. Cyanide seems like a bizarre nod to \"The Difference\" by The Wallflowers. The closer Won't Say Anything is clearly influenced by '90's alt-pop from the likes Sugar. While these songs wear their influence proudly on their sleeve, each of them exude an undeniable \"Bad Religion-ness\", proving the songwriters' unique vision, even when trying on a different musical hat.Dissent of Man is not the first time that Bad Religion has attempted to expand the stylistic possibilities of their sound, (New America certainly attempted that), but what makes this album so enjoyable is that these sounds are embraced enthusiastically and confidently (rather than lethargically), and attempting these sounds with the drumming prowess of Brooks Wackerman in the mix, the band sounds seasoned, powerful, and visionary.\n", "val": 0.019550757482647896}
{"text": "I somewhat reluctantly pre-ordered The Dissent of Man a couple of months back in order to get the orange vinyl. Money is tight, so I hated to put money down on an album with only two songs I'd heard. I got it in the mail about 3 weeks ago and have been loving it ever since then. My turntable is malfunctioning so I can't review the quality of the vinyl, but they were nice enough to include a free CD with the vinyl(something they didn't mention when I ordered it). I'd first like to say that I'm not really a punk rock, and probably not even a typical Bad Religion fan. I do, however, really enjoy their music. So, now that that's out of the way, here's a little analysis of the songs found on the CD.1. The Day That the Earth Stalled - Meh. Not a good start to an album in my opinion. At first glance I was liking it, but after listening to it a second time I really dislike it. It has a good sound to it, but the lyrics just seem a bit out of sync with the music. The lyrics also aren't anything special. This one isn't terrible, but it's nothing Special. 2.5/52. Only Rain - An excellent song in every respect. Meaningful lyrics and a great rhythm, you can't get much better than this song. 5/53. The Resist Stance -  Interesting intro, great song. Many others have already mentioned the Sabbath style intro to this song and I personally think it works really well. 4.5/54. Won't Somebody - Not My favorite on the album, but a good song. I've heard a lot of people speak very highly of this song, but to me it's just good. It's a solid song with meaningful lyrics but it's by no means the first song I want to listen to when I play this album. 4/55. The Devil in Stitches - Another solid song. A somewhat unusual style for Bad Religion, but it works out pretty well. Although it's the closest thing to pop on the album, it's still way better and far more meaningful than what you would typically hear on the radio. 3.5/56. Pride and the Pallor - Really not sure how to feel about this one. There are parts of this song that I absolutely love, but it definitely has its flaws. Upon first listen, I really disliked this song, but after listening to the album once more, I've enjoyed it far more. The one thing that bothers me about this song is the line \"And happiness is never so far far away.\" For me, this line ruins an otherwise excellent song, it just seems out of place and doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the song. Otherwise, it's a great song, one that I continue to listen to despite this flaw. 3.5/57. Wrong Way Kids - Great song, but I have to agree about annoying pronunciation. I didn't notice it initially, but after reading another review, I can't get over the way Greg pronounces \"kids.\" Meaningful lyrics and a fun beat give it a 4/5.8. Meeting of the Minds - Great. I don't love the intro, but I think overall this is a great song. Good lyrics and an interesting rhythm. 4.5/59. Someone to Believe - Lyrics aren't bad, but the beat really annoys me. This one is OK, but nothing special by any means. 2/510. Avalon - Favorite song on the album. I absolutely love this song. I could listen to it over and over again, something I've already been doing for the last couple weeks. Excellent lyrics, beat, and vocals. Vocals are nothing particularly unusual, but they just really seem to fit the song. 5/511. Cyanide - Unique and enjoyable. What an unusual song for a Bad Religion album, or even my preference in music altogether. For whatever reason though, I'm really enjoying this one. Lyrics aren't anything spectacular, but it's a fun song. Always nice to see them trying new things. 4/512. Turn Your Back on Me - Filler. Not a bad song, but it's nothing spectacular, just OK. 2/513. Ad Hominem - A little different, but nothing special. Some have called this \"rap,\" but I wouldn't say it's anywhere near rap. The lyrics are sub-par and the style isn't really my thing. 2/514. Where the Fun Is - Just Bad. I just skip this song when listening to the album now. 1/515. Won't Say Anything - Another really atypical song for Bad Religion, that works really well.  An excellent song that really shows their range as a band. For something new and excellent lyrics 5/5.Although this isn't my favorite BR album, it's definitely up there. They tried a lot of new things on this album and I really believe there is something for everyone. I've listened to 7 of their albums all the way through in the last week, something that really made me realize how much variation they've had over the years. This is a great album from a truly legendary band. 5 Stars.\n", "val": 0.012535777874290943}
{"text": "\"The Dissent of Man,\" the new Bad Religion album, is about what I expected.  This is one of my favorite bands, and I like (and own) everything they've put out, including this one, but it's far from their greatest release.1. The Day That the Earth Stalled: 8/10 This is the best album opener since \"Supersonic,\" perfect pace for an opener too, and I like the lyrics.  Now, if only it worked as a whole song...2. Only Rain: 7/10 This is a nice moderately paced song, but it's missing that something that could make it outstanding.3. The Resist Stance: 8/10 This one has a lot thrown into it: metal intro, gang vocals, punk bridge, anthem lyrics, but loses points for being too short and ending with 20 seconds of a dead note.4. Won't Somebody: 9/10 This was my favorite new acoustic song on the special edition of \"New Maps of Hell,\" and I'm glad to see it made it on this album.  I think I prefer the acoustic version, but this is nice too.5. The Devil in Stitches: 6/10 This is one of the most original songs on the album, but I really don't care for it.  The lyrics have no hook, and they don't fit with the music.6. Pride and the Pallor: 6/10 Another somewhat original song, the lyrics fit the music better, but it still feels like a hook is missing.7. Wrong Way Kids: 7/10 To the tune of \"All There Is\" with \"I Want to Conquer the World\" intro.  It has a lot of promise at first, but disappoints a bit, still pretty good.8. Meeting of the Minds: 10/10 To the tune of \"Germs of Perfection\" this time.  I like this song a lot, better than \"Germs of Perfection\" and one of my favorites on the album, great lyrics and pacing.9. Someone to Believe: 10/10 The riff has a Ramones feel to it, which is abnormal for Bad Religion.  This song is the catchiest on the album and tied for my favorite with the previous.10. Avalon: 9/10 This song had the potential to be one of the all-time great Bad Religion songs, but it falls a little short in the lyrics.  It sounds like a longer version of \"Social Suicide.\"11. Cyanide: 7/10 It's different, I'll give it that, and I kind of like when Bad Religion attempts love songs, but the lyrics are subpar and don't fit the music.12. Turn Your Back On Me: 5/10 Ditto the above, but worse.13. Ad Hominem: 8/10 To the tune of \"Watch It Die\" this time.  The lyrics are striking at first, and the song is catchy enough.14. Where The Fun Is: 5/10 This one is clearly filler.15. I Won't Say Anything: 9/10 It's original and charming, perhaps not the best closer, but I like it.Overall, this album is very good, better than \"New Maps of Hell,\" but it doesn't measure up with Bad Religion's best.  Since I gave \"New Maps of Hell\" 4/5, I think I have to give this one 5/5.  It's still a Bad Religion album after all.\n", "val": 0.00040332370554096997}
{"text": "I think this CD has the best songwriting I've ever heard on a Bad Religion album. I heard the single before the album came out and I thought I wouldn't like it. I'm glad \"The Devil in Stitches\" is the ONLY sub-par song on this record.The Day The Earth Stalled - This song kicked my ass from beginning to end. I don't understand why people seem to not like this one.Only Rain - It seems that people think this is the best song on the album. They are almost correct, in my opinion. It is a fantastic song, but not the best.The Resist Stance - Plain, good-ol BR. This is the track that should appeal to all fans of Bad Religion.Won't Somebody - A slower song. I love the build-up to the chorus. This is also one of my favorites on this record.The Devil In Stitches - I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why this song is the lead single. It is the weakest song on the record. It just sounds silly to me and I know they will play this song when I see them...Pride And The Pallor - Everything about this song is amazing. The way the lyrics are sung to the music, the harmonies, EVERYTHING. This comes in at a close second for my favorite.Wrong Way Kids - This is, without a doubt, my favorite song on the record. I cannot get enough of it. I hope they sing this song when I see them; the chorus would be amazing with a crowd there to sing along.Meeting Of The Minds - This is the other ass-kicker song. It never lets up and I couldn't be happier.Someone To Believe - A real fun sing along, in my opinion. I believe this song will become a staple in their sets for future shows.Avalon - A really melodic punk song. I enjoy it most times and skip it sometimes.Cyanide - I have to be in the mood to listen to this one. I don't like it much but it's not because it's a silly song like the single. It's just not my style.Ad Hominem - It's on the slower side but I actually really enjoy this song. I very much enjoy the chorus. I rarely skip this track.Where The Fun Is - This main riff of this song sounds like 21st Century Digital Boy. I don't mind because I like that song. Although the lyrics are not as good as that one. I skip this one sometimes.I Won't Say Anything - I don't understand why I like this song so much but I do. It just seems to calm me.The following tracks are on the digital deluxe version...Finite (Bonus Track) - This song's chorus is odd and I can see why it is a bonus track. I don't like this one very much but I do listen to it from time to time; when I'm in the mood.The live tracks Best For You, Pessimistic Lines, How Much Is Enough? and Generator sound like they were mixed for the 30 Years Live album and left off of it. They are all performed well and are kick-ass songs, just like their studio counterparts, but Generator is the one that really sounds amazing. It is also the song I like least of the four studio recordings.Consensus - IMO, the best songwriting Bad Religion has produced. This, by no means, means every song on here is the best BR song I've ever heard. They are not all executed flawlessly but I do believe this is the best album since Generator. This is what The Process of Belief should have been and actually sounds like a direct successor to that album.\n", "val": 0.010614076629281044}
{"text": "I have listened to it a few times through.  \"Only Rain\" and \"Wrong Way Kids\" are the major standouts for me.  They sound the most like old school Bad Religion and what you have come to expect from the band.Also, \"The Devil in Stitches\" and \"Cyanide\" were different from what they normally do, but they work really well.I would not want to try to compare this album to anything else.  There are elements of Recipe For Hate, No Control, and Against the Grain here.  However, there are new sounds that have not been done before.A few songs at the end kind of drag and I had gotten used to there being great enders on all their albums.  However, the last 4 songs on this one are slower and different.  Not bad, just different.All in all I give it 4 stars.  Some songs here I would really like to see done live.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the record drags a bit at the end.Check it out and give it a listen.  You won't be disappointed.  Great vocals and guitar work on this album.  And yes, of course the bass and drums are great too.  But, the guitar work really stands out and Greg's voice sounds as good as ever.\n", "val": 0.02691013552248478}
{"text": "Right before a new BR cd is released I'm always hoping that it's going to completely knock my socks off, just as Stranger than Fiction did. This particular album only did that for a few select songs. Although out of the other songs that I did not care for, some of those are ok to just listen to if you still just put cd's in the car.My opinions are roughly the same as the others who wrote about The Dissent of Man, but of course, a bit different. The new era of Bad Religion albums since the return to Epitaph have had this certain feel to them: Those parts in the songs where they throw down that grouping of major and minor chords that give you goose bumps are very prevalent. On the flip side, with the new album, not all the songs are good. Everyone knows that as a band ages and the albums are put out every couple of years that we're going to hear some similarities between albums, but also any record on it's own should have it's own account for the nature of \"packaged collection of songs,\" if you will.The reason why I do not like some songs on this record is because they remind me too too too much of certain songs on other records.I really like the song Sinister Rouge. The Day the Earth Stalled is about the same tempo, is in the same key, and shares similar chord structure and rhythms as Sinister Rouge. It seems like it could have been a good song, but a no dicer for me. Try this experiment if you haven't already: Listen to Earth Stalled and immediately follow with Sinister Rouge. Ask yourself: So why does Does Earth Stalled suck and the other doesn't?ONLY RAIN is a freaking amazing song. I would be very surprised if they did not play this song at the show. What's cool about the new BR records is that use of 3 guitars. Most bands can't pull that off, or even try, or need to(mostly).The Resist Stance is also one of those good songs. Just listen to it.Won't Somebody is an alright song. The band themselves like it enough to record it on the new live record, but just like I do sometimes in my car, they should skip it when they come to my city. On the flip side, this is one of those songs that if you're in the right mood for it is a good one to listen to, it's one of those BR sing-a-long songs. This band has always done just that - write songs that you like but you also don't like sometimes.The Devil in Stitches is a great song to me. This is definitely the preferred chanty sing-a-long song that I would like to hear at a show, kind of like Los Angeles is Burning and Sorrow. Everyone has to admit it: Even though Bad Religion has always kicked ass, they do write some songs that are pretty emo, although I will not capitalize it there because in no way am I remotely putting it close to genre of Emo that some of these kids have come to love of the past few years. Why is that? The eye liner, the weird hair cuts and all the whining?  Greg Graffin does not whine about what is on his mind, he sing passionately with what I consider a normal singing voice. Go and meet any singer from any Emo band and tell him to sing a verse from one of his pathetic heartbreak songs, but to do so with a natural voice, and not the why he recorded it all nasally and whinny. If some of you BR fans are also fans of music that I'm making fun of then I do apologize, but seriously, I just can't take it seriously. It's ok if girls like Emo, though. Sorry to get off track I should save those rants for bashing Emo albums. So devil in stitches, yeah.The Pride and the Pallor is a silly song. The message of the song is clear after a read of the lyrics. Once you get that then the music goes with it, I guess. But I have been skipping this song. Musically and lyrically, I just don't think this song rocks. My friend that makes fun of Bad Religion would have a field day with this one.Wrong Way Kids is one of the other good tunes on this album. But why Keeds? Sometimes you don't even hear the \"s\" sound. I guess he thought it was cool. Maybe it's an inside joke. Although if I had the chance to meet Greg Graffin I know I would probably only have time for a question or two, and I probably wouldn't waste one about keeds in wrong way kids. But still I like the song. Whoa oh oh!Meeting of the Minds is a kick ass song. But doesn't it sound like they took the bridge from Germs of Perfection and made a song out of it? It's really weird, but still, I love the song. Probably because I like Germs of Perfection.Someone to Believe is a song that I don't like. First of all, it sounds just like the song Murder from New Maps, and I really can't stand that song. Someone to Believe is a perfect example of too too much oozin and ahzin, especially when you throw it in so close to the beginning of the song. That anticipation needs to build. Also, I think it was a very poor choice in placement of their signature Ya Ee Ya Ee Ya Ea Ya Ea Ya harmonies. It sounded good in Resist Stance, and Digital boy.  It ends with a nice major chord though.Avalon - I think it's a good song. Others will disagree. Give it a few seconds then it kind of just feels right.Cyanide - Sounds like a love song. So again, timing will be a key factor in when you would actually want to listen to it. I don't think it's a bad song at all. I think if another band wrote this song I would feel the same way. Let's face it, songwriting becomes a very personal as the craft is exercised and as the body ages. If they're going to perform a song that sounds like a long song they might as well play 1000 Memories, at least that one is faster.Turn Your Back on Me is one of those whatever songs. If they played it at a show I'd go toilet, or get a drink, then go back to the front.Ad Hominem is an ok song. I wouldn't want to hear it at the show. From what others are saying about this song is that they hate. I just don't think it's a super kick ass BR song. The main riff reminds me of Watch it Die from Recipe.Where the Fun Is sounds too much like The Empire Strikes First. Those A&R guys better not think this one is a single. It's not a terrible song, but I hope Bad Religion will write a record next time where the songs aren't so similar to it's predecessor.I won't say anything. We'll for that song...not what I expected for closing the record. Usually those are faster and melodic songs, like Fields of Mars, Don't Sell me Short, Bored and.. and In Many ways. They changed it up a bit this time. It's pretty emo, guys.Hope you get what you're looking for in the record.\n", "val": 0.00307475752197206}
{"text": "I gave this album five full days to sink in, with about two full plays per day plus extra plays of the best (imo) tracks.  First a quick background of my fandom:Started in 1997; thought No Substance was awesome (always thought I was in the minority there but that sentiment seems to have turned); Don't Sell Me Short is my fave track all-time; The Quickening and Beyond Electric Dreams are two tracks from Empire that I always hear panned but I think are incredible; my two fave old-school tracks are Flat Earth Society and Against The Grain; I've seen them live three times and will be at the Philly show in a couple weeks; I am myself a rational agnostic.  Hopefully that give a little perspective behind my grades...  I give The Dissent Of Man four-and-two-thirds stars simply because there's some of everything on this fine effort.  More slow is usually not more good with bands like BR but most of the mid-tempo tracks here work for me (and I was never a \"Slumber\" or \"21st Century Digital Boy\" fan).A+: Only Rain, The Resist Stance, Meeting Of The Minds, Someone To BelieveA : Wrong Way Kids, AvalonA-: The Day That The Earth Stalled, Cyanide, Turn Your Back On MeB+: Ad HominemB : Won't Somebody, The Devil In StitchesB-: Pride & The Pallor, I Won't Say AnythingD+: Where The Fun Is  The run from tracks 7-13 is about as strong a 7-track set as one will find on any album.  It's still too early to say front to back, however, that this is better than New Maps Of Hell (if Dissent gets 4.67 stars, New Maps probably gets 4.80 for me), but so far it's making a strong run.\n", "val": 0.008660548366606236}
{"text": "If you don't feel like reading all this, I will sum it up: This is an eclectic, well-written BR record that is held back by a few awful songs at the end.Overall, \"Dissent\" has the Brooks-era sound that fans have come to know since \"Process of Belief\", and the songs are most easily compared to songs from this period BR. \"The Day the Earth Stalled\" is a solid opener; nothing fancy and the lyrics are nothing to write home about, but it is fast, driving, and has a catchy chorus. \"Only Rain\" is one of the best songs on this album. Great lyrics, fast, catchy. Musically a bit like \"Grains of Wrath\" from \"New Maps\" which is fine by me. \"Resist Stance\" starts with a total Sabbath riff, and quickly bursts into a typical BR song while maintaining the riff. Fairly clever, though my first thought was \"oh no, BR trying to do Sabbath?\" Both bands rule, but either trying to sound like the other would be laughable. Anyway, this song is a winner musically and the lyrics deal with trying to maintain a radical state of mind as you age by balancing idealism and realism, a theme probably relatable for a lot of BR fans, me included. \"Won't Somebody\" is an ok song...reminds me a bit of \"Broken\" from \"Process\". \"The Devil in Stiches\" might be the most interesting song on the album. It sounds- lyrically and musically- like Born to Run-era Springsteen, with a little more kick of course. Great lyrics and hooks without being too poppy or cliche. Same with \"Pride and the Pallor\". Great lyics and hooks and different sounding for sure, but in a good way. \"Wrong Way Kids\" is one of the best songs on here, but what the hell guys? The guitar into is almost identical to the into to \"I Want to Conquer the World\". If played live I don't think I'd know which song it was until the verse kicked in. Maybe this is intentional and I'm missing the point or something. Despite this, the catchy woah-oh chours gets stuck in your head quick. \"Meeting of the Minds\" is fast, driving, good. \"Someone to Believe\" is kinda blah, not a huge fan. \"Avalon\" is a top song, great middle part with a worthy Graffin \"watch out!\" beforehand. \"Cyanide\" is a total rock song, maybe a little country even. But somehow it works. Great hooks, very different from standard BR. Pedal steel reminds me a bit of some of the \"Recipe for Hate\" material, but this song structure is very different....and thats where I wish the album ended. The next three songs are throwaways- and that is being kind. \"Turn Your Back On Me\" is boring and forgetable. \"Ad Hominem\" is a version of a song on most all late-era BR records. It was done best on \"Process\" with the song \"The Defense\". It was done not-so-well on \"New Maps\" with \"Submission Complete\". \"Ad Hominem\" is much, much worse than that. Dumb lyrics, awful song structure and style. Worse, it sounds like \"Struck a Nerve\" in parts, which only serves to remind how much better that song is as well. \"Where the Fun Is\" might be one of the worst BR songs ever. Lame music and dumb lyrics. Makes some of the \"New America\" stinkers smell good. \"I Won't Say Anything\". Here's the deal- this is a well written song, but I don't want it on a BR record. It is too poppy- and not in a good way like \"Slumber\" or \"Whisper in Time\". I would enjoy this song on a Graffin solo release, but not as a bookend on a BR album. Just my opinion, I know people are liking this song.All and all, here is what I'm doing. I'm burning this onto a CD-R without the last four tracks and rocking out to it and admiring the great songwriting. I will try to forget the last four songs, and hopefully the band does too.\n", "val": 0.011991819366812706}

And the lyrics can sometimes be cheesy or impenetrable...too cute by half, I'd say. But the best songs create a halo effect for the album, making the whole much shinier and more listenable than some individual songs might be.Interestingly, I think that Bad Religion itself (which probably in this case chiefly means Graffin) is of the opinion that \"The Devil in Stitches\" is among the strongest songs on the album, as indicated by its earlier digital release prior to the CD coming out. I don't agree. The song has a nice pop framework and ALMOST clicks, but there's some weird hitch in the transition to the chorus that keeps it from being outstanding. It's like watching a broad-jumper stutter-step before launching, but it would take a better music theorist than I am to explain exactly what's going on in the song that hits my ears wrong.Quibbles aside, this is a truly great album, and not just a great Bad Religion album, and well worth the wait. I was getting antsy for some new Bad Religion music, and while this represents a pretty radical departure from the much earlier Bad Religion music that drew most of us to the band in the first place, I see it as a natural and welcome evolutionary step. Did we really want to keep them as museum pieces, turning out the same 80s sounds indefinitely? How cool is it that I can detect hints of Green Day and--so help me--The Carpenters in some of their material now?Speaking of evolution and museums, the CD comes with a great booklet for the liner notes that I assume previews or reflects Graffin's book, coming out at the same time as this CD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Anarchy-Evolution-Faith-Science-and-Bad-Religion-in-a-World-Without-God/dp/0061828505/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Anarchy Evolution: Faith, Science, and Bad Religion in a World Without God</a>.

{"text": "The Dissent of Man, the latest effort from Bad Religion, may admittedly be disappointing to some fans.  Many of the songs are mid-tempo numbers, lacking some speed; however, these songs are not lacking in melody, power, and drive.  Of these mid-tempo tunes, the first single, \"The Devil in Stitches,\" is my personal favorite track on the album, with \"Cyanide\" and \"Pride and the Pallor\" close behind.  \"The Resist Stance\" opens with a Sabbath-esque guitar riff; it works well as an intro to this great song.  \"Won't Somebody,\" which first appeared as an acoustic number on the deluxe edition of \"New Maps of Hell,\" is given a band arrangement here that works well.  And, songs such as \"The Day that the Earth Stalled,\" \"Wrong Way Kids,\" and \"Meeting of the Minds\" display speed and force.  Throughout the disc, Greg Graffin's verbiage and the \"oozin' ahs\" of Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley are present like old friends.I find The Dissent of Man a worthy successor to New Maps of Hell.

{"text": "Ellie Goulding.I first heard of her when she was tagged as \"similar to Imogen Heap\" on the zune marketplace. I listened to the album preview on there and was... interested, but not stoked at hearing more.Until 'Lights' came on.After abusing the repeat button for way too long, I just had to hear the full song. And while searching for it, I found out that there were two versions -- The EP version, which is the version I'm writing a review on, and  a shorter version, available on the album and the re-release. It's really just the same song, and I bought and love both. The EP version just has a longer intro while the album version jumps right in with the bass.It's hard to describe the song. It has a throwback to the 80s feel that's very danceable, and Ellie's voice is very pretty. I understand the comparison to immi as her lyrics are very artistic and could have multiple interpretations. Lots of layering and manipulating her voice. It can definitely gets stuck in your head too! \"Lights, Lights, Lights, Lights...\"If you like the track, I suggest 'Starry Eyed' (it's the song she's KNOWN for) and 'Under the Sheets'. And if you're on YT, everyone loves to remix (read: DUBSTEP) the heck out of Ellie's songs. Definitely check those out as well.\n", "val": 0.002329860581085086}

The range of the melody is wide, and undulates; the electronica at the beginning and end sort of prepares you for the story, the message; they remind me of bubbles randomly forming and bursting; and before you know it the message and it's messenger are gone as quickly as they came.

{"text": "This isn't a bad album. It runs from hard rock to pop. Most of it is forgettable. And perhaps that is the fault of the debut single \"Porn Star Dancin'\". Let's be serious. That song set the bar incredibly high for this debut. It is one of the few songs I've heard that captured me up front - from the first stanza where I couldn't wait to get a hold of the CD. While \"Porn Star\" is cutting and ready to be heard loud, the same can't be said for the rest of the album. The balance of the songs aren't near as alpha and are much more mainstream in style and lyrics. They aren't breaking any new territory and while that isn't bad, it isn't exciting either. My guess is that, given all the cameos in the Porn Star video, it was written Chad Kroeger (Nickleback) and Ludicrous as a song to get this band noticed. It did but the rest of the music just doesn't measure up.\n", "val": 5.4153882956597954e-05}

{"text": "There are a few catchy beats here and there, a passionate vocal once or twice, sometimes a tuneful melody, but that is all. Shontelle's \"No Gravity\" is positively earthbound.The great majority of these tracks sound like Rihanna B-sides. The beats sound almost identical throughout, and the lyrics are repeatedly bland and canned.Only formulaic lead single \"Impossible\" has an above-average melody that is worth more than one or two spins. The problem is that, like much of the album, it feigns originality and real emotion. Through the lyrics, the singing, the production and the videoclip, the song has been manufactured to appear serious and passionate when it is, in actuality, totally calculated. A close listen reveals there is no emotional pulse or punch inside it. It has no inner life, only outer life - ideal for mainstream acceptance in 2010.In spite of her chosen occupation and her hard work and luck, Shontelle is a totally unremarkable singer. \"Say Hello to Goodbye\" is the best example - when she sings \"'cause it's gone forever/no more try, you and I, not now not ever\" is when her voice sounds its weakest.Her vocals run ragged pretty quickly because her vocal range is clearly very limited. In the 70s neither she nor Rihanna would have ever gotten past the front door of a record company's corporate offices.When she tries to display passion on the likes of the bouncy, flighty, paint-by-numbers \"Helpless,\" the Darkchild-helmed \"Perfect Nightmare\" and even the somewhat pleasing \"Love Shop,\" she sounds more like an inexperienced high school girl who fantasizes about real love and emotions rather than a grown woman who has actually experienced these feelings. It is simply because she is not emotive enough to be a substantial singer. She sounds the most invested in the title track, the song she co-wrote.The-Dream is certainly talented, but everything he has been churning out for the last two years has sounded irritatingly similar no matter who he is working with, and his \"T-Shirt\" collaboration here fits that mold perfectly. He has a nice, sonically-pleasing trick up his sleeve, but that trick has run its course. It's time for any - any - change in his sound.\"No Gravity\" is an oxymoronic album because it is absolutely defined by gravity. It takes no risks and offers no passion, grit or soul. It is just another grab-bag of songs tossed off by a record company sung by a mediocre talent.\n", "val": 0.00012808124301955104}

{"text": "\"No gravity\" is the sophomore CD by Shontelle who has been compared to Rihanna merely because they both hail from Barbados.Her debut \"Shontelligence\" had a UK top 10 hit in the rather drab ballad \"T-shirt\" in 2008. It appears here again remixed and featuring The-Dream and sounding much better.The CD comprises 10 tracks split between ballads like her US top 20 hit \"Impossible\" (a sweeping Show-stopping ballad that allows her vocals to soar), the lovely acoustic \"Say hello to goodbye\" and the piano \"Kiss you up\".Everything else is aimed squarely at the dancefloor; \"Perfect nightmare\" (a lovely piano intro gives way to a Techno-ish stomper), the clap-filled \"Take ova\" with Pitbull (which sets tribal beats to an electro rhythm), the sunny retro Funk/Soul \"DJ made me do it\" with Asher Roth (remniscent of Jamiroquai), \"Love shop\", and \"Helpless\" (synth-driven Eurodisco). The title track  is surging synth Pop that wouldn't sound out of place on a Kylie Minogue album but it's rather dull.With a current renaissance of Dance music (Usher, Taio Cruz, David Guetta and Black Eyed Peas, to mention a few), there's no reason this shouldn't do well.

Obviously everyone has their preferences--and so do I--but I found something to like in every track on the album. In short, the band has a great sound that makes each song a joy to hear. Based in a classic room-filling metal, they aren't afraid to toy with mixing in some catch-you-by-surprise electronica in all the right places. Combined with some great pop harmonies and all-male vocals and (sometimes explicit) lyrics, the result is powerful--and entirely worth your time.Groups that this group reminds me of, in various ways: Savage Garden, Linkin Park, Nickelback, Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace.  If this album is any indication of their potential, My Darkest Days has the potential to be really great.

After I listened to the full CD several times, I became a fan of the band. They came to my local area on tour with Hinder, Saving Abel, and Default.I was very excited to see them live. That would change after the first song I heard live from this band. They don't play completely live. Most of the lyrics were done by lip syncing and the instruments were mostly back tracking. One particular member of the band was Reid Henry. Reid is the keyboard player / backup guitar player. He has absolutely no talent. The only time he actually played the instrument was during the beginning of the song to start the back track. The part that made me laugh the most was that he tried to play an instrument called a 'theremin' by using the keyboard. I will never go to see them live again, they are horrible. So enjoy the CD, just sucks that it will never sound the way it does on disc, live. That is what truly makes a  band to me.\n", "val": 0.0003613036824390292}

{"text": "This is the self titled debut album by American rock band \"My darkest days\" originally released in 2010. The band is clearly influenced by the 80s glam metal and alternative scene; as I am not familiar with the modern rock subgenres and for that I will have to approach this album as an old school rock/metal fan.Generally the album includes equal amounts of hot rocking tracks and subtle/radio friendly tunes. Therefore those who favor hard rock and glam/hair metal will brobably be more attracted to songs like the opener \"Move your body\", \"Every lie\", \"Pornstar Dancing\", \"Goodbye\" and \"Set it on fire\" representing the heavier side of \"My darkest days\". The band consists of lead singer/guitarist Matt Walst, guitarist Sal Costa, bass player Brendan Mc Millan and drummer Doug Oliver.One has to also adress the guest appearances and contributions on this debut: Obviously the song \"Porn star dancing\" is their most recognisable rocker featuring mainstream rock star Chad Kroeger (who also co produces the album) and metal guitar legend Zakk Wylde. Still, the album benefits from songwriting contributions by lesser known, yet equally experienced, songwriters much like Harry Hess (\"Harem Scarem\") an authority in melodic rock/AOR genre.In terms of production one is glad to find out that the drums are granted a rather thick and sustained sound while the guitars are loud but overproduced at parts, loosing a good amount of their attack while one also expected more lead guitar parts and solos. Finally the vocals are thankfully all-clean and substantially melodic, a definite plus for the album.I have to say it was the beautiful cover artwork and flamboyant promo video of \"Porn Star dancing\" that drew me to \"My darkest days\" still it is doubtful whether this album would appeal to old school 80s rock fans beyond the heavier songs mentioned above.\n", "val": 0.007268885150551796}

Very modern/mainstream style of rock, but very good nonetheless. Probably about 75% of the songs are good enough to be played on the radio and become hit singles. Sadly, that probably won't happen since they are a little known band. If they keep producing high quality music and if their first album gains steam however, they'll be big.

Others are slower, and much deeper. I can't determine which is my favorite. \"The World Belongs to Me\" gives me strength and confidence. \"Like Nobody Else\" reminds me of better times. \"Goodbye\" assures me that I'm not alone in my experiences. \"Can't Forget You\" keeps me in reality.

If you like bands like Nickelback, Sick Puppies, Hinder, or Three Days Grace you might like My Darkest Days. Don't expect anything deep or original here. I can hear the influence of Chad Kroeger and Matt Walst's big brother from Three Days Grace, but Walst's vocals are a Hell of a lot more tolerable than Adam Gontier and his bandmates are damn good muscians. I was impressed w/ the cover of Duran Duran's Come Undone. It had just enough rock added to give it a new twist and even if Walst doesn't have Simon Le Bon's range or vocal experience, he did a great job. Overall, this is a better than usual debut album.

For all you rap fans Ludacris makes his debut with the alternative( YA BOYYYY) version. 'My Darkest Days is a Canadian post-grunge band based in Toronto'. This one makes Hinder sound original. It seems like a calculated by the numbers attempt to generate one (available at Walmart now) hit single. I hate almost all modern rock but this one sounds very sterile,even by today's standards.

{"text": "If you want real country music, Randy Houser  is one artist that's guaranteed to deliver. I've been following Randy's music long before his first cd was released and I knew his name would be one I'd hear again and again. When Randy Houser  sings that first note, you know you're in for a great performance.Randy made a huge splash with his first cd, \"Boots On\" and his much anticipated follow up cd, \"They Call Me Cadillac\" delivers more of the same \"say it like it is, THIS is how it's done\" country music, complete with lyrics that draw you in, steel guitar that cries in the background and a voice so powerful that Randy makes each song much more than just another song, he makes each song an experience. The first single released from the cd,\"Whistlin' Dixie\", is one of those country songs I love, those that say more than the words ever could - \"I am who I am, I'm not changing and if you have a problem, then it's YOUR problem\". In a total flip of the musical coin, \"Somewhere South of Memphis\", Randy articulates the song in such a way that it puts the listener right in the middle of the story, makes them feel as though they're right there with him as he spreads his father's ashes and mourns the loss of his best friend. Similar to Jamey Johnson, Randy Houser  has a true appreciation for what he writes and what he sings and it shows. Randy has that vintage country sound that never grows old and thankfully, for those of us who love it, never goes away.My recommendation? Well worth the money. Buy it, love it, let others know about it and play the pure country out of it. Randy Houser  is how I like my country.[...]\n", "val": 0.018831612542271614}

{"text": "I have listened to this CD every day for two weeks straight now, and in my opinion \"Aurora\" stands as an all time classic big band recording. It has everything-- classic , swinging charts that leave a lot of room for the excellent soloists. A monster trumpet section led by Wayne Bergeron (whose lead work here must be counted among his best work ever), a rock-solid rhythm section bolstered by the great Chuck Berghofer and Peter Erskine, and a recorded sound so glorious you literally have to hear it to believe it. You have NEVER heard a big band sound like this (Thank you Al Schmitt). The cuts are all superb, but the one that really stands alone for me is the closer \"There You Go Again\". This one rocks from start to finish (that shout chourus!!), and features a sublime, relaxed, supremely inventive trumpet solo by Warren Luening. I CANNOT get this solo out of my head, no matter how hard I try. A hands down classic. A minor miracle of melodic invention, Luening is absolutely riveting here , one chorus just natutrally flowing to the next. This minute and a half is ALONE worth the price of the CD. Suffice it to say, ifyou really enjoy big bands and respect the tradtion, and do not investigate this terrific recording, I feel truly sorry for you\n", "val": 0.019612472504377365}
{"text": "Full disclosure:I am a small time investor in this project(probably paid for the pencils)but reap no monetary benefit form this album. I'm just a fan. Since the late 1960s,when Verve released \"Shades\" on their blue label(non jazz)I've been hooked. No,\"Shades\" was not a jazz album,but it was a fine pop instrumental album using a big band of then New York's classic studio musicians. And even then,I had already heard Pat's music as commercial jingle work and studio work for Steve Lawrence & Edie Gorme without knowing it. Two albums followed in equal vein,full of humor and great musicianship(e.g.-Dick Hyman does a calliope solo on the Beatles' \"Get Back\";he really got back,way back). Phil Ramone was learning how to control the knobs on these recordings. Such fun.Years pass and Pat found himself doing lots of TV & movie work,notably lots of MTM productions,including backgrounds for Mary Tyler Moore and all the stuff for Bob Newhart,Lou Grant and Molly Dodd(I understand Pat considers that a favorite,with good cause). And,in 1974,a one-shot big band album,titled \"Threshold\". Ask anyone who knows modern big band stuff;\"Threshold\" brings an immediate smile. This is real jazz. Screaming,piss off the neighbors cause it beats out the Grateful Dead(personal experience)solos by Tom Scott & Marvin Stamm. Capitol released it,but Pat bankrolled it and owns the master,so it's available,here and via Artists Share.The years go by,the projects,mainly for film &TV are interesting and even a Pulitzer nomination for \"An American Concerto,featuring Phil Woods. And many would love to hear a return to a pure music project from Mr. Williams.\"Aurora\" is it. Pure music. Pure originals. Pure Pat. It swings,it gently bows;it cooks;it smokes and when it's gentle,it's like a breeze. Threshold II,like originally planned? Not quite,and that is a good thing. No laurel resting here. There may not be a screaming moment like the original Threshold,but those neighbors will probably knock on your door and ask what cool stuff is coming out of your speakers. Recorded in Sinatra's famous Capitol studio(Pat worked on Duets project)with Al Schmitt behind the glass(imagine the Texas Rangers being able to bring in Nolan Ryan for this year's World Series,the best)and this time not only Tom Scott,but Eddie Daniels and Arturo Sandoval,along with many true LA studio greats. Check around online and you can see some video. And get this. Let's hear more from Mr. Williams.\n", "val": 0.010239670984447002}
{"text": "This long-awaited album by Patrick Williams far exceeded my expectations... and my expectations were that it'd be nothing less than absolute genius. It's so GREAT to have Pat making records again. My play-by-play is below...\"Aurora\" is a beautiful Latin-turned-swing chart with HUGE, brassy, classical fanfares in its intro. Burnin' solos by Andy Martin (trombone), Tom Scott (alto),  Bob Sheppard (tenor), and Chuck Findley (trumpet).\"Heat\" is a dizzying mix of tabla, great sax section work, and an incredibly swinging section spear-headed by Peter Erskine (drums) and Wayne Bergeron (lead trumpet). Great solos by Warren Luening (trumpet) and Bob Sheppard (tenor).\"Song for Pretty Girl\" is an absolutely gorgeous and lush ballad featuring Arturo Sandoval on flugelhorn.\"Fanfare For A New Day\" has a fiery, brass-heavy intro and later turns to a rousing swing. It features the fine solo work of guest Hubert Laws (flute) and Bob Sheppard (tenor).\"One More Dream\" is a gorgeous ballad very much in the Nestico-Basie tradition. It features the stunning alto of Tom Scott.\"The Sun Will Shine Today\" is a medium swing tune which features the outstanding clarinet of guest Eddie Daniels.\"Mandeville\" is a medium Latin which features beautifully textured French horns and muted brass. It features Craig Gosnell (bass trombone), Bob McChesney (trombone), and Andy Martin (trombone).\"There You Go Again\" is medium gospel-swing chart very reminiscent of 1960's Neal Hefti. It features Tamir Hendelman (piano), Warren Luening (trumpet), Bob Sheppard (tenor), and Tom Scott (alto).\n", "val": 0.032166168093681335}

Mandeville, a dreamy, beautiful and haunting piece is my special favorite with  outstanding trombone work through-out. I can listen to that piece 1,000 times and never grow tired of it. Each song is arranged perfectly by Williams. You can really hear the joy and excitement of all the band members in this recording. You can sense that they new it was one very special gig and they gave it their all. I own hundreds of jazz CD's and I must say, this moves to the very top of the list. I can only hope that Patrick Williams and Artist Share follow this up with another outstanding recording. The quality of the recording was terrific as well.

{"text": "I am assuming that approaching this phenomenal album, one has had some exposure to jazz and big band music.  I'm not saying one has had to have had extensive listening experience with the likes of Be-Bop or \"Progressive Jazz\" (it helps, to be sure) but at the very least have demonstrated an ability to just sit down and listen.  If you can do that with this album, you will be truly blown away as well as richly rewarded.An album like this comes along only once in a great while.  I think of Count Basie's \"Atomic Basie\", Duke Ellington's \"And His Mother Called Him Bill\" (featuring some of the best charts of Billy Strayhorn) Maynard Ferguson's \"A Message From Newport\", NYJO's \"Full Score\" (unfortunately never released on CD) and Illinois Jacquet's \"Jacquet's Got It\", to name a few.  These are the kind of big band albums one returns to time and time again to listen without ever tiring. Such is the case with this fabulous album!I was first drawn to this album after hearing Aurora, the first track on this tremendous album.  That track alone would have been worth the price of the CD!  But there are seven other tracks no less compelling.  All eight tracks were deftly and masterfully composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Patrick Williams.  Moreover, he has assembled a veritable \"Who's Who\" of performers and top-drawer sidemen.  You will have to buy the album to see who I am talking about, but trust me, your jaw will drop!The solo improvisations on each chart are absolutely galvanizing!  The interplay of soloist and band had me saying time and again, \"I can't believe what I am hearing!\"  Nothing is predictable and everything makes perfect musical sense!I purchased this CD from Artist Share via Amazon.  The 19.95 price tag, as far as I'm concerned, is a real bargain!  The folks at Artist Share are very friendly and offer an online access to the artist's creative process.  While I have not taken advantage of that as of this writing, I expect to do so.  If you love jazz and big band music, this album featuring The Big Band of Patrick Williams is a \"must-have\" addition to your library.

{"text": "Wow! Another Patrick Williams record is out - this is an event for me, and what a great one\"Aurora\" is!  I became a life-long  fan since the first time I heard his incredible big band album\"Threshold\" back in 1975; that one left a permanent impression on me when I was in collegeand just getting into jazz. I've since collected most everything he's ever done, including hisfilm scores. \"Aurora\" is fabulous, and has no less than 27 musicians in his big band this timearound, with eight selections all composed, arranged, and conducted in his beautifully uniquestyle one can instantly recognize.  The first cut, which is the title tune, immediately remindedme of \"And On The Sixth Day\" from the previously mentioned \"Threshold\" album. When I firstheard the beginning of \"Aurora\", I thought it was another version of \"Sixth Day\", but it takesa different turn.  The great Tom Scott (another \"Threshold\" veteran) returns here on alto saxthis time. \"Heat\", the next cut, features trumpeter Warren Luening and veteran Bob Sheppardon tenor sax in a marvelous chart by Patrick. I recognized \"Song For A Pretty Girl\" from Patrick's1980 score, \"How To Beat The High Cost of Living\", which originally featured Hubert Laws andEarl Klugh. This version has fine fugelhorn work by the legendary Arturo Sandoval. (On Patrick's1987 album \"10th Avenue\", this same tune has the title, \"Her Song\", featuring the late MichaelBrecker on tenor sax.) With \"Fanfare For A New Day\", I was once again reminded of \"Threshold\",with similar horn voicings by Patrick, and featuring brilliant flute work by the great Hubert Lawsalong with Bob Sheppard again on tenor. The gorgeous ballad \"One More Dream\" contains morefabulous playing by Tom Scott on alto sax.  \"The Sun Will Shine Today\" is dedicated by Williamsto Curt Wilson and the TCU Big Band, and is a beautiful chart showcasing the monster clarinetchops of Eddie Daniels. \"Mandeville\", the following track, features double trombone work by BobMcChesney and Andy Martin - absolutely brilliant writing and arranging by Williams. The final cut,\"There You Go Again\", finishes out the cd in fine fashion with stellar contributions from Luening,Sheppard, and Scott in beautiful form along with superb work from the pianist on the whole date,Tamir Hendelman. Bravo to artistShare and Patrick Williams for this magnificent big band release!\"Aurora\" is solid gold, and beautifully recorded and mixed by Al Schmitt, as well.  I eagerly awaitPatrick's next project, and wish him all the best.  He's a CLASS ACT all the way.  100 million starsfor \"Aurora\", and ALL the stars in the universe for Mr. Williams and his incredible composing, ar-ranging, and conducting skills (along with generous teaching). He also produced \"Aurora\".P.S.  For those who may not be aware, \"Threshold\" is available as well on ar-tistShare - it has to be heard to be believed.  It won a Grammy in 1974, andfeatures jaw-dropping performances by cream-of-the crop studio and westcoast jazz musicians (including Tom Scott and Marvin Stamm) who were handpicked by Williams to interpret and play his extremely difficult big band charts.It was originally released on cd (and cassette tape) back in 1988 for a limitedtime on Williams' fine Soundwings label, which, unfortunately, did not run long.A masterpiece and still stunning to this day. Also, for a revelaing look at hisexceptional film scoring skills, check out the beautiful soundtrack to \"Cuba\",little known from 1979, and available on cd from Kritzerland (limited to 1000copies) - absolutely gorgeous.\n", "val": 0.03270906209945679}

Billy does continue to deliver the goods this time, with his radio friendly, easy breezy country. This is a good time album- NO \"Walk a Little Straighter, Daddy\", songs on this set- all just\"Enjoy Yourself\" songs, Not all great songs, but a few outstanding ones, like \"Love Gone Gone\" the infectious., \"Bad Day of Fishing\" and \"All Day Long\" My least faviorite tune on the album is \"Let Me Down Easy\", very similar to other soulful ballads he has done, but not as effective. My favorite song is the novelty country song \" Like My Dog\"This is a turning point in Currington's career, his fourth cd for Mercury. If this one does well, one gets the sense that the record company will give Billy Currington more freedom to call the shots.\n", "val": 0.01828704960644245}

I have seen him on several occasions & he is always so accessible to his fans, in fact-he goes out of his way (& personal safety sometimes!) to let people get close to him. You can see that he thoroughly enjoys what he does & honestly wants you to have a great time along with him.I love the funny stuff, but I will always love his heart-wrenching ballads.....Must be Doing Something Right will always be my favorite. He just has a way & a voice to be able to do almost anything, but when he lets go on those sweet love songs or sad heartbreak songs, it gets to you right down to your soul. He could recite the phone book to music & it would be great!This new cd has something for everyone....you won't be disappointed.....my only question is....when's the next one!\n", "val": 0.02931170165538788}
{"text": "Prime Cuts: Perfect Day, Pretty Good at Drinking Beer, Let Me Down EasyWith song titles like \"Enjoy Yourself,\" \"The Perfect Day,\" and \"Pretty Good at Drinking Beer,\" Currington has taken a hiatus from those overtly serious and stuffy inspirational material such as his former chart toppers \"People are Crazy\" and \"Good Directions.\"  Rather, following in part in the footsteps of Kenny Chesney, he has decided to take it easy on this album filled with a reposeful groove over tunes that celebrate life in its simplicity.  Thus, taken in such a predilection, \"Enjoy Yourself\" lives up to its album title.  Though these 10 cuts may not offer shafts of life changing insights, it is a fun, catchy and enjoyable endeavor.  In the process of lightening up, Currington has become more accessible and relatable.  This is further enhanced by his wry self-deprecating humor often giving the entire set a hint of edginess.  Helmed by co-producer Carson Chamberlain (who recently produced Easton Corbin's excellent debut), the sparse (and often with a hint of an island) backings befit the tenor of the disc making our listening experience breezy, relaxing and jovial.It's no surprise why country radio has devoured vanguard single \"Pretty Good at Drinking Beer\" by elevating it to the penthouse position of the country chart.  \"Pretty\" is a low key charmer that has a way of slipping into our memory with its infectious island-like groove that is made even more accessible with its honest down-to-earth message.  Told in the first person narrative, here Currington admits he's not good at what most men excel (working hard, mowing the lawn, fixing cars et al.) but he's pretty good at drinking beer.  More humorous moments come with Harley Allen and Scotty Emerick's \"Like My Dog.\"  Despite the deprecating concept of comparing his lady to his dog, the song is reek with refreshing humorous lines.  Here's an example:  \"He never says I wish you made more money/He always thinks that pull my finger's funny,\" this has to be one of the most clever lines in a long while.  On the other hand, album opener \"All Day Long\" may not chart new territory melodically or lyrically, yet this propulsive straight forward love song has an immediacy that will anchor Currington with another hit again.Yet, not everything here is light hearted and frivolous.  Dean Dillon (writer for over 50 of George Strait's cuts) makes an appearance here by contributing \"Perfect Day.\"  Somehow similar to another Dillon co-write \"The Best Day\" (a number one by George Strait), \"Perfect Day\" is a romantic getaway song that will swoon those who like Currington in his more tender moments.  Though the ballad \"Let Me Down Easy\" does not divorce itself from the beach/island references, it's a serious fiddle-drenched slowie with Currington bearing his soul to his lady.  \"Until Now\" (which is incidentally the album's longest track clocking in at 4:45 minutes) is a slice of 80s pop that is pleasant without much to shout about.  Currington gets gritty with \"Little Lonesome Dixie Town\" a Lee Roy Parnell-esque barn burner with some extended funky guitar riffs.\"Enjoy Yourself\" is an apt title for this fourth release by Currington.  It's meant to be taken as an sonic escapade - where we can laugh, enjoy and take life easy.  And to this end, the album works.  However, if you are looking for a life changing experience, this disc is not it.  Sure there are a few ballads and some more contemplative moments, but there's nothing really that insightful here.\n", "val": 0.008714920841157436}

{"text": "On Billy Currington's new CD Enjoy Yourself, I must highlight his song, 'Love Done Gone.' This track is not only country but has high energy jazz elements and a great feeling of that New Orleans attitude! A great track that I hope will find a release date! If I could do anything more to this song, I would have made it longer- expanded- the ending to honor the fantastic instrumentals that make this such a great 'shuffle' for dancers.Billy is a favorite here in the country dance club, Oil Can Harry's in Studio City. We are always testing his music on the dance floor.Enjoy Yourself is a great gem because ALL the tracks 'work.' All are good for listening and work wonders on the dance floor.- Waide Aaron Riddle, author of 'The Chocolate Man: A Children's Horror Tale' and 'Red River County From Short Story To Screenplay.'\n", "val": 0.03473908081650734}

Sure, there are still the slow stuff like \"Let Me Down Easy\" and \"Until You\" but for the most part, the album lives up to the title - Enjoy Yourself. It makes you just want to listen and relax/chill outdoors or at the beach. My personal favorites are 1) \"Love Done Gone\" - sad lyrics with a very fun and bubbly melody, and 2) Pretty Good At Drinking Beer - it is what it is (oh and this one, he sang during the CMA music fest in June where i journeyed all the way from the Philippines to Nashville...just a side commentary, if I may). 5-star rating all the way! :)\n", "val": 0.01559440791606903}

{"text": "John Legend with the RootsWake Up (2010) SonyFive StarsThe current John Legend release is a serious throwback project. It harks back to the days when music with a social message really meant something. Legend has struck pay dirt for sure by collaborating withfunk soul band, The Roots. Revived are tracks previously recorded by the likes of \"Baby Huey\", Robert Flack, Donny Hathaway , Ernie Hines, Marvin Gaye and reggae artist, Prince Lincoln.  According to press releases, the project was inspired by the election  of Barack Obama as President.The major  standout on this Grammy caliber project is the musicianship. The Roots' drummer , \"?uestlove\" is the time keeper through and through.  Canadian recording artist , Melanie Fiona and Common take a guest spots on the title track. Vocally,  that track is nowhere near what Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes  (with Teddy Pendergrass) did with it. But, it is impressive.  Rather than rely on pre-canned tracks or annoying auto tune misuse , this is a live collection of recorded sessions. True voice and true music is presented without meaningless fluff, silly catch phrases or bling, bling references.\n", "val": 0.009790005162358284}
{"text": "Rap royalty and neo-soul star power come together on the fine&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wake-Up/dp/B003TXKSWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wake Up!</a>, a covers album by The Roots and John Legend.  While 'Wake Up!' doesn't \"reinvent the wheel\" by any means, it is an enjoyable and soulful listen, finding both the Roots and Legend at their best.  While the Roots rap contributions are modest here, that is smart considering the tone and the scope of this album.  John Legend sounds among his most soulful ever here, particularly on the best cuts.  There are moments that sag just the slightest bit, but the dynamic moments easily mask the sagging ones.\"Compared to What\" opens the album superbly with atmospheric retro-soul production work that possesses an organic quality.  The extended instrumental opening simmers for over a minuter until Legend's soulful vocals enter.  While \"Compared to What\" is lengthy, it is quite enjoyable, accentuated even more by the soulful use of organ, trumpet, and saxophone.  \"Hard Times,\" similarly, doesn't miss a beat, again beginning with a dramatic opening and the incorporation of a tasteful rap verse.  \"Little Ghetto  Boy\" opens with a rap, incorporating The Roots' prodigious rap talents, something that is only subtly appears throughout this album.  The piano work here by Legend is spot on.\"Wake Up Everybody\" features fine guest spots by Common and Melanie Fiona. Here, the super collaborative team do a fine job of recreating the Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes classic with some sense of justice.  Similarly, \"Our Generation\" shines finding Legend channelling his gospel roots - particularly on the out-tro section (\"Atlanta...come on Lagos, lets straighten out...) \"Humanity (Love the Way It Should Be)\" incorporates reggae and works, though it isn't as \"epic\" as say \"Compared to What\" or \"Hard Times\" or \"Wake Up Everybody.\"  \"Hang On in There\" is solid, featuring low-key production work that shimmers.  It is \"I Can't Write Left Handed\" though that redirects the energy of the album back to the level set early on.  Here, the production work is easily the best of the album and The Roots and Legend truly let loose. Sure, it's over eleven minutes in length, but once you hear it, you will instantly note it is the very best cut of the album.\"Wholy Holy\" features understated production work (compared to the overt nature of \"I Can't Write Left Handed\").  Here, Legend sounds best as he channels the gospel elements of his voice as far as nuances, phrasing, etc.  \"I Wish I Know How It Would Feel to Be Free\" one-ups \"Wholy Holy\" cranking up the tempo and finds the super-band all but performing in the church.  The gospel element here is inescapable and one just wishes the cut were longer than its brief duration.  \"Shine,\" the only original (penned by Legend) is typical Legend songwriting and closes the album strongly, though not say revolutionarily.As far as the production work and concept,' Wake Up!' is easily the year's most unique R&B album.  The performances are enjoyable, but maybe more enjoyable and awe-inspiring is the atmosphere of the album - the music sounds like it came from the 60's and 70's.  As far as the content, this is a solid (actually better than solid) album, but the lengthiness of the tracks and the occasional \"over-indulgence\" sometimes wears on a bit too long.  With that said, there isn't that much to quibble about here; the Roots and Legend do a much better job than most people do making cover albums.  Exceptional effort overall in my eyes.  4 stars.\n", "val": 0.02486523985862732}
{"text": "Neo Soul crooner John Legend hooks up with Hip Hop collective The Roots to release \"Wake up!\", a collection of covers of socially/politically conscious Soul classics from the sixties and seventies. This has been a rather prolific year for The Roots as they released \"How I got over\" earlier in the year.Both were inspired by the 2008 United States presidential election and chose songs they felt were obscure. The album has a loose live-jam feel to it with the only Hip Hop infusion being sporadic rapping by Black Thought or guest rappers.The lone original composition is the church piano-driven \"Shine\". \"Humanity (Love the way it should be)\" is horn-sprinkled Reggae. They eschew the popular songs on Marvin Gaye's \"What's going on\" going for \"Wholy holy\".Lead-off single \"Wake up everybody\" features Common and Melanie Fiona and is light and breezy. \"Hard times\" and \"Compared to what\" (with an incredibly groovy bassline and funky horns) are Funk/Soul, \"Little ghetto boy\" an airy organ-driven Jazz/Soul ballad, while \"I can't write left handed\" is a sprawling 12 minute epic, an anti-war lament originally done by Bill Whithers telling the story of a wounded war veteran writing a letter to his mother.Each song stands out really, and what prevents the album from being too depressing and preachy are the excellent vocals and superb musicianship. A much needed wake up call musically.\n", "val": 0.003840605728328228}
{"text": "Most cover albums are failures from the jump. It's not really the artist's faults, it's more a problem with the fact that most of us consumers just can't let go. We love those classic songs that we grew up with, so we just naturally figure \"Hey, there's a new version of My Funny Valentine out there, I'm there!\"Instead what we tend to get is meaningless and pointless versions of songs that have none of what made us treasure them. Whether it's the artist's voice or tempo of the remake, or perhaps it's just a matter of that original song hitting you at the right moment, and becoming embedded in your timeline, it's just not the same. Often it can make you angry to hear a remake of a beloved song and have it just destroy all your positive thoughts.In my entire life, I've only heard three albums that involved covers that I willingly would listen to regularly. UB40's \"Labour of Love Volume 1\", The Jeff Healey Band's \"Cover to Cover\" and the Bob Marley tribute album called \"Chant Down Babylon\"And that's it. When I see an album of covers I tend to steer clear, because the odds are just not in your favor if you're wanting to be entertained.So that's why I was curious when I first heard about the new John Legend album that he did with The Roots called \"Wake Up!\". While I've never really been what you'd call a \"fan\" of Legend, I've absolutely loved some of his songs.Also, Philly band The Roots are, in my opinion, one of the top 10 bands of all time. OF ALL TIME! They're that good. I'd stack them up against anyone in any genre, and particularly hip hop they're heads and shoulders above everyone else. They're lapping the competition something serious.Their newest album \"How I Got Over\" is their best album in years, and easily dominates 99.9% of anything that's come out this year. (I left the .1% because I haven't heard everything, but that's about the percentage chance I give anything of being better).  At this point in their career, you see a release with The Roots on the cover, and you just put your credit card on the counter, and just say \"Run it.\"So the two teaming up for a set of classic soul music is a great idea, and the fact that the songs are all socially conscious tracks just makes it even better. That is why I have been geeked out for several months after hearing about \"Wake Up\", the newest release by Legend, and his first collaborating with The Roots.When it comes to cover songs though, especially ones like these which are evoking specific memories and social commentary from back in the civil rights era, and the war in Vietnam, you have to have a voice that can carry these tales. Your voice has to not just hit the right notes, but has to be able to invoke the very essence of the song. You're not just singing a song from 40 years ago, for many people you will be attempting to recreate a moment in time. An important moment in our history in which the soul singers of the past stood up, put their name out there and decided to fight for what they believed in, the one way they knew how: with their voice.And in that respects, John Legend does a heck of a job. While I've always liked his singing, on this album I think he truly steps into the spotlight as an artist. His voice is perfect for these songs, and Legend has the proper amount of inflection and balance to his voice, if that makes sense.Listening to this album with your eyes closed, you can almost imagine that Legend was actually back in the 60's singing these for the first time. With the highly accomplished band The Roots backing him up, and with Legend's more than capable vocals, there's virtually nothing to find fault with this. In fact, the only area that I can imagine someone really taking issue, is the additions of Black Thought or Common's rapping on some of the songs. I can imagine there will be the purists who will find that just atrocious that there would be added rap lyrics ontop of what truly are classic songs.And to that, I would suggest that most of those who would not like the rap lyrics on here are also ones who would take offense at their favorite songs being covered in the first place. Meaning, that nothing is going to satisfy them, and that if it wasn't the rap, it'd be something else. However the rap actually adds to these songs, and does not detract. They're not there just for the hell of it, or a \"Buy the Roots get Black Thought free\" or something. Black Thought is a top 10 MC, folks. Much like Edward Francis Hutton, when he speaks, you should listen. He's often got a lot to say, and this release is no different.The songs being covered on here are pretty impressive, and while I don't think any of them will replace the original in my heart or mind, they are by far better than most covers out there. I don't think anyone could touch Donny Hathaway's original \"Little Ghetto Boy\" or Marvin's \"Wholy Holy\", however there are many that Legend is just in a groove. Many of these songs have heavy heavy subject matter, and are songs that you don't simply hear. You listen to it, you close your eyes, you soak it in and absorb it.I find myself listening to him singing \"I Can't Write Left Handed\" and try in vain to understand what it would be like, as the song's protagonist sings, to be in a war that I didn't understand. To desperately find someone to write home to my mother and beg her to get a deferment for my brother so he didn't get sent off to war as well. To be at that point that I felt that I would never get home alive, and wanting with all my heart and soul to somehow try to save my brother from a similar fate.It's a heartbreaking situation that Bill Withers just perfectly laid out in his original. While Legend doesn't surpass the original, he is just flat out on fire on this song, and there's really nothing to criticize.If you're a fan of Legend or The Roots, you need to buy this. You need to just not even think about it and just get it. But I really don't need to tell you that, if you are. If you're a fan of those two, you really didn't need any provocation, and you've probably already pre-ordered it, and just wanting to see what someone else thought about it, and whether it was as good as you imagined it would be.It is. For those who perhaps never heard either Legend or The Roots, well my friend, you're in for a treat. This is a perfect introduction to the two, and I guarantee you that once you've heard this, you'll want to find more albums by The Legendary Roots Crew, and the fantastic Mr. Legend. A man who shows signs of absolutely living up to that heavy last name.\n", "val": 7.278797420440242e-05}

One interesting quip that other reviewers  have here is the song selection. I actually think this is where John and The Roots absolutely struck gold. Sure, they could have gone the more familiar route with \"Mercy, Mercy Me\", \"What's Going On\" and \"Ball Of Confusion\". Their masterstroke was going the other way with less recognizable selections in my opinion.You can tell these guys love and respect this music. Some of the arrangements stick pretty close to the originals (\"I Can't Write Left Handed\", \"Humanity\") and some are rearranged (\"Compared To What\").

{"text": "I am neither a John Legend Fan or a Roots Fan, but this album may get me to listen to other work that both have done.  This soulful protest music, largely drawn from African American artists in the late 1960s through the early 1970s, is fantastic.  It has the classic soul music sound while updating it with new arrangements and commentary in the form of hip hop lyrics.  It has all the classic elements of soul music sounds while simultaneously conveying old lessons as they apply to our times and universal truths.  John Legend has a great sound here, and has really expanded his style from crooner into a man ready to push barriers to make a more meaningful and important music. Questlove and the Roots musical selections, arrangements, and playing are both respectful of the tradition while updating the sound for the modern listeners.  They play with musicality and soul.  If you appreciate great music that is both entertaining while challenging, this is your album.I bought this on Vinyl with fantastic well designed packaging, a full double album photograph in the interior of the band, and vinyl record dust cases with commentary and descriptions of the tunes.  I was surprised both by the quality of the recording, the packaging, and the art.  I will also admit, that I believe most things sound better on Vinyl.  Clearly a labor of love by Mr. Legend and the Roots, it is packaged for a long shelf life.  This album is a must have if you simply love music.  It gets  better every time I spin the record.

{"text": "The little man on my right shoulder wants me to call this the best covers album I've ever heard; the little man on my left shoulder is telling me to contain my hyperbole. At the very least, this is one of the top releases of 2010. Inspired by the election of Barack Obama and upset about the wars our nation is engaged in, John Legend and The Roots got together to cover lesser-known socially-conscious songs from the '60s and 70s. I'm not the biggest John Legend fan; he never does a bad job, but I don't think is voice is as soulful as he does. However, The Roots reestablish themselves as the funkiest, most flexible band around, easily switching from funk to soul to gospel to R&B to pop to reggae. Without The Roots, this project would have flopped; they should get top billing. All this AND they rock it five nights a week as the house band for Jimmy Fallon. This is a fantastic album - the only downside is that eventually the listener becomes aware that these songs are, unfortunately, still relevant 40 years after they were written.While most of these tracks hit, there are a few clunkers. My favorites include the funky Compared To What, Wake Up Everybody, Our Generation, Hang On In There, and I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free. It takes courage to cover Donny Hathaway, and the cover of Little Ghetto Boy doesn't quite measure up to the rest of the album. Also, Wholly Holy just proves that Legend shouldn't try to cover Marvin Gaye. Ever. I'm afraid to comment on the only original piece on the disc, the closer, Shine. This was written by Legend for the psuedo-documentary Waiting For Superman and I'm afraid this posting will quickly get off topic. The show-stopper on this disc is the superb take on Bill Wither's epic anti-war anthem, I Can't Write Left Handed. Starting softly and calmly, this song continually builds for 6  minutes until guitarist Captain Kirk Douglas rips into a face-melting two minute solo that puts Legend in the corner. Then the band brings it down before revving it back up for another killer guitar solo. The whole thing last 11  minutes and I'm just drained at the end.

What about something from Marvin Gaye's \"What's Happening\" like \"Flying High in the Friendly Sky\"?  How about a Curtis Mayfield tune like \"Freddie's Dead\" or \"Thin Line\"?  And, as far as political messages go, a Gil Scott-Heron song like \"Gun\" or \"Pieces of a Man\" would have been nice.  Since the band on this album is supposed to be top-notch, why not include a Mingus song or let the band stretch out and include an instrumental like Coltrane's \"Alabama\" or an Art Blakey burner like \"Free for All\" or \"Freedom Rider.\"  Of course, there are so many great Soul and R&B tunes from the era covered, it's hard to pick just a handful to record but I think William Parker's tribute to Curtis Mayfield \"Inside the Songs of Curtis Mayfield\" is the real deal that Mr. Legend may have been striving for.\n", "val": 0.0013755304971709847}

{"text": "In the years that both The Roots and John Legend the general world around them had actually returned to a state very similar to the way it was in the late 60's/early 70's. Political and social tensions are running rampant yet again among almost everyone and so it seemed fitting that when these two soulful and funky musical entities got together it would be these issues rather than ones of a romantic nature would be dealt with. After seeing a sneak peak video about the making of this album I was convinced that Legend,Questlove and Malik Yusef were on yet another mission of \"saving music\" here and sacrificing high quality production values and original material by spouting a \"real instrument\" only ethic while interpreting songs by Curtis Mayfield,Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers. As commendable as this goal was it often has the effect of diminishing the music itself when it's bogged down with such heavy baggage so I tossed it aside. Upon hearing parts of it I decided to give this album a chance and,I must admit it's not quite what it's own hype was delivering on. True it isn't perfect and on some occasions the \"naturalness\" ethic does stick out more than it should. But the very fact that this album will DEFINATELY not \"save music\" is actually part of it's charms. This album is made up primarily of cover versions of message centered songs such as \"Hard Times\",\"Compared To What\",\"Hang On In There\",\"Wholy Holy\" and an 11 minute version of Bill Withers anti war story song \"I Can't Write Left Handed\". Legend brings a lot of passion and life vocally to these songs and the music is genuinely funky with it's scratch guitars and basslines,even if the live drums are played by Questlove in a somewhat hollow manner. On the other hand some of the lumbering,downbeat nature of these songs may not make them quite as condusive to \"partying your troubles away\" much the way the originals are. And that is where the saving music ethic comes in; John and The Roots seem to take these songs a little too seriously to infuse them with much joy and hope. A bit more potent in that respect are the Yusef penned \"Little Ghetto Boy\", a wonderfully poetic groove that tells it's story with a glimmer of hope for the character involved. Same goes for the albums closer in the gospel fueled \"Shine\",same going for the reggae jam \"Humanity (Love The Way It Should Be)\". There are elements to the album that will detract from it's appeal to some and a lot of them have to do with the way the artists themselves come at the music. But considering the very uneven quality of John Legends previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Evolver/dp/B001E7OO2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Evolver</a>&nbsp;this could be the start of something big in terms of rediscovering a positive musical direction for all parties involved.\n", "val": 0.00286291865631938}

The greatest part is the song selection, which speaks to our current state and conditions.

The title song \"Wake Up\" has some of the weakest \"we can do it if we try\" lyrics I've ever heard.  Its not a call to social action, its a song about \"things are gonna be ok, so lets go do our jobs well.\" yawn.In all, the album reminds me of being at a Barack Obama rally (I actually did attend one). Before he came on, the music was similarly funky but safe. Its all inclusive, but in the end it has no teeth.  And that's why I have to give this album three stars.\n", "val": 0.0001067668417817913}
{"text": "I'm with those who are disappointed with this album. From the concept I thought it could be a dynamite album.  But it's only half good, thanks to poor song selection and mostly ho-hum arrangements.  With all the great anti-war and social consciousness songs available from the 60s and 70s, they picked a weak crop.  \"Compared to What\" is a of a classic choice, but this arrangement doesn't compare to the rave-up Les McCann/Eddie Harris version on the Montreux live album.  It's just ok.  \"Wake Up Everybody\" is another classic song and at least in this case the album delivers a worthwhile remake, thanks to the vocals of Melanie Fiona and the inclusion of a rap break.  But otherwise, I'm just not that impressed.  The low point comes when people in the car beg me to turn off the screaming repetition of \"They shot me in the shoulder!\" from \"I Can't Write Left Handed\" and I'm happy to oblige because I can't stand it either.  I had an inkling I wouldn't like this album when I heard it was being promoted through Starbucks.  By and large I haven't liked the company's taste in music.\n", "val": 0.00025636079953983426}

{"text": "Like most fans my age, my first exposure to The Posies came with seeing the video for \"Dream All Day\" on MTV and snagging a copy of Frosting on the Beater. As I started to dig into their back catalogue I came to Dear 23 and officially fell in love. But just as I was becoming obsessed, the band was falling apart. When I heard news of a reunion and a new album in 2005, I was naturally excited. Every Kind Of Light confused me a bit, however. There were some great tracks, and some interesting experiments, but something just didn't click. It felt more like a sequel to Private Sides, with long stretches of one songwriter's contributions rather than the typical alternating Jon-Ken format of earlier albums. The differing styles both had explored on their solo efforts seemed to have taken over, to the point that only a handful of songs on EKOL even sounded like true Posies songs. But there was enough punch and enough catchy choruses to keep me from losing faith in my favorite band, so I hung on tight waiting for the next album. As Big Star and other side projects took up more and more time, I wondered if there would be another album at all.Fear not, citizens of Posie Land, Blood/Candy has arrived, and it is the return to form we've all been waiting for. Jon and Ken are back at the top of their game with an amazing collection of songs and mini-epics. Their harmonies are as tight as ever, their choruses bury themselves in your brain, their lyrics challenge you, yet this time out the sound is more varied, more experimental, and more cohesive than EKOL. Ken's piano finally sounds integrated into the Posies sound, rather than sticking out like a sore thumb as it did on EKOL. Jon's chugging pop songs like \"So Caroline\" provide the perfect balance to the strange sounds and complex structures of tracks like \"Licenses To Hide\" and \"For The Ashes.\" Jon even gets in on the act himself with the wildly experimental \"Accidental Architecture.\" The cameos help take things to another level, and the wonderful production accentuates all the right parts of these songs to make them sound both grand and intimate - often on the same track. And since no one else seems to have commented on this, the artwork is amazing, possibly the best of any Posies album yet. Definitely buy a physical copy of this one, you're missing out on so much if you only download the mp3's.Blood/Candy might not be your typical Posies release. It's not the best thing they've ever done. And it more than likely won't win them a new audience. But what the guys have accomplished here is so much more than I ever expected at this point in their career. It is a return to form, and at the same time a departure into uncharted waters. It is a startling work of art that stands alongside the classic pop albums that influenced them. This album is their Odessy And Oracle, their Pet Sounds, their Arthur, yet it is something unique and original. If you're a Posies fan, this is a no-brainer - you need this in your collection. If you're new to the band, perhaps start with one of their Geffen albums (Dear 23, Frosting On The Beater, Amazing Disgrace), but don't waste too much time before you pick this one up. Any fan of challenging and intelligent modern pop/rock should definitely give Blood/Candy a listen, you might be pleasantly surprised.\n", "val": 0.008601432666182518}
{"text": "I was happy when EKOL came out in 2005, because it signaled a full time return of my favorite band of all time. EKOL on the other hand was an OK effort with a few memorable songs. It seemed a bit rushed to be quite honest. Blood/Candy on the other hand is an all out Posies joy. I think what makes me so happy is that Ken is back in top form. He tried to be a blues guy on EKOL and it didn't work for me. However, Ken's contribution on Blood/Candy is simply amazing. I feel a little of the \"blues\" Ken on Plastic Paperbacks, but all is erased when you listen to the fantastic \"She's Coming Down Again!\" or \"Enewetak\". Jon Auer shows up with the typical Jon Auer greatness...\"So Caroline\" comes to mind...awesome verse, check. Killer chorus,check. Killer bridge, check. Jon Auer is easily one of my favorite songwriters and I will buy his work until I'm not around to buy it anymore! Two things I do need to point out, I felt \"Plastic Paperbacks\" could have been swapped for \"Take Care Of Yourself\" as the lead song and the harmonies at the end of \"Enewetak\" have me singing \"Don't Sleep In The Subway Darlin...\" One final note...\"Licenses To Hide\" is the only song that doesn't do it for me. Jellyfish can pull something off like this, but it didn't work for me with The Posies doing it. This is a Posies record that should not be missed.\n", "val": 0.014530680142343044}
{"text": "I've been a Posies fan going back to 1988, when you could catch them playing the occasional house party near the University of Washington campus. In terms of bias, familiarity can make a sub-par record seem better, but by the same token, it's also fairly difficult to be surprised by someone you've known for nearly 23 years. So when I say the greatness of Blood/Candy shocked me, it's not just hubris void of perspective. It's in turns both a return to Frosting on the Beater rock and a wide expansion of their talents. Ken Stringfellow's song contributions especially seem to have The Posies reaching into areas you never thought they'd try. There's the theatrical \"Licenses to Hide,\" the zany Pet Sounds-inspired \"Enewetak\" - name for the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific which were abused by the US for nuclear testing - and the soaring \"For the Ashes.\" Meanwhile, Jon Auer had his own left-turns up his sleeve, unleashing the challenging \"Accidental Architecture,\" which must have tilted a few heads when he introduced the song to the group in the studio.  Sure, there are a couple songs here that fall into the classic Posies sound (and seem ready for radio), and those have always tended to be Auer's contributions, whose confidence in his McCartneyesque songwriting has made him Mr. Reliable (see \"The Glitter Prize,\" \"So Caroline\" and \"Notion #99\"). But even the classic (and the almost nursery rhymish \"Cleopatra Street\") have so much going on that it begs, nay demands, repeat listens to get the full effect. To my ears Blood/Candy is the first album since Auer and Stringfellow's styles started more noticeably diverging (around 1996's Amazing Disgrace) where the potentially conflicting styles mesh in perfect harmony, with both artists reaching forward and out to each other, and it's a wondrous thing to behold.\n", "val": 0.007237170357257128}
{"text": "I've loved the Posies since I heard the first notes of \"My Big Mouth\" from their \"Dear 23\" album, and I've been a big fan of everything they've done together as a band since. This album does have a different sound/vibe from their others, and in part I think that it's because Jon's and Ken's songs have grown more distinguishable from one another than they used to be. That is, to my ears, this record sounds *a little bit* more like a combination of their recent solo efforts (particularly, Jon's \"Year of Our Demise\" and Ken's \"Soft Commands\") than it does like a fully integrated Posies album (not to the extent of \"Private Sides\", but you'll hear what I mean). This is also a generally more mellow record than their others. I must say, though, that when they put their voices together in earnest, they sound as wonderful as ever, and frankly I enjoy every song from start to finish. For me, some of the stand-out tracks are \"Cleopatra Street\", \"For the Ashes\", \"She's Coming Down Again!\", and \"Holiday Hours.\" But, as with every Posies release, there's not a clunker here anywhere, and I think that this one will really reward multiple listens (and the more careful the listen, the better). If you're new to the Posies, I don't know that I'd necessarily recommend this one to you as an introduction (it's just too uncharacteristic of their full output), but if you're even a casual fan I believe that you will want to play it again and again.It's great to have them back!\n", "val": 0.022671468555927277}
{"text": "First off - the clips don't summarize well these songs, which go off in many different directions.  Particularly notably in that is the only song clip I didn't like, Licenses to Hide, which song actually sounds nothing like the clip.  Buy the whole album vs single cuts or you'll miss out on 90% of the art and miss what the Posies have done here (hey, you can always leave the cuts you don't like off your iPod).Lots of variety here.  Lots of complex art-pop and piano ballads here.  I hear Beatles myrth, New Pornographers compositions, Beach Boys cheeriness, classic Posies earnestness and guitar rocker thrillers and anthems- lots to really like and enjoy here.  Definitely an Album worth of music and styles- like any great work should have.I'll admit that when Ken gets behind the piano it's not my favorite style.  That said, these cuts are across the board fun.  They go in unpredictable places and that makes me smile and my ears happy.Lots of classicly great Posies style songs here too, enough to justify the purchase of the entire work so that you can have the freedom to sample the other cuts that perhaps are not what you expected or less immediately approachable.Bottom Line - Great album.

Breaking free of looping, droning video game music, the game uses the  sweeping orchestration not as a background noise, but as a dramatic device  all it's own.  Because some of the pieces were written to match scripted  events not in the game, listening to this CD evokes images of a  non-existant \"Medal of Honor- The Movie\".  The hero's theme is as  adventurous as anything Indiana Jones has ever heard, while the Nazi's big,  bold brass theme is suitably tyrannical and arrogant.  Also, listen for the  bonus tracks: a Berlin big-band broadcast, the game's climactic ending, and  a very wobbly national anthem.  At it's core however, this CD evokes the  same feeling that the game does: the urge to be a hero.\n", "val": 0.016440093517303467}

{"text": "Medal of Honor is a war score in the tradition of John Williams. The core themes are excellent, and Michael Giacchino's composing talents are used to their fullest abilities.The Allies and Patterson Themes are brave and noble, while the Nazi theme is sinister, yet fun and bombastic, slightly like the Imperial March.Standout action cues include 'Taking Out The Railgun,'The Radar Train,' and 'Rjuken Sabotage.' 'Panzer Attack' introduces the Panzer theme, which is one of my personal favourites.'Merker's Salt Mine' includs a repetitive motif that creates the feeling of zooming by in a mine cart. The finale, 'The Jet Aircraft Facility' is brilliant, with a rousing rendition of the Patterson Theme and nazi Theme in persuit. 'The Road To Berlin' is a nice jazz piece that fits in well.There are 2 extra secret cues not listed here, but I won't spoil the surprise!

{"text": "I remember being blown away by all the great gameplay qualities of Medal of Honor when it was first released. I was caught up in the 'Saving Private Ryan' feel the game had. It was only until I began replaying the game more that I keyed into the music. WOW! It is nothing short of fantastic. Medal of Honor made me really appreciate the music behind the game. I just recently bought the cd and it is just awesome. As well as bringing back some old memories it also has a few hints to Frontline at points in certain songs. I bought this along with Underground. Medal of Honor is a great compilation of all the music heard throughout the game, so if you've played the game, you know what I'm talking about. I'm going to hopfully order the Frontline soundtrack soon, as I have been completely blown away by the beauty of this and Underground. This and Underground go great together but the stand out tracks in this album are Medal of Honor, Taking out the Railgun, Panzer Attack, The U-boat, and The Road to Berlin. The whole album is fantastic. Buy the whole Medal of Honor soundtrack collection. You won't be dissapointed, especially if you love the games as much as I do.\n", "val": 0.04220971465110779}
{"text": "The way I became engrossed in Medal of Honor was buying the Allied Assault game for the PC, which was most enjoyable.  I was struck particularly by the in-game music which sounded as if it had been lifted from a movie.  I discovered that whilst unfortunately there is no CD release for the \"Allied Assault\" score, other games in this franchise have had the music released, including this, the first.  I bought this CD on the recommendations of reviewers on this website and on more specialist soundtrack-reviewing websites.Anyway, what do I think of it?  Actually my first thought on hearing the opening track was slight disappointment, purely for the reason that it was a different track to the one I imagined, that being the title music from \"Allied Assault\".  But on re-listening track 1, it is simply wonderful.  The lonely trumpet evokes imagery of a lone soldier, perhaps surveying a WW2 battleground, then joined by his comrades in arms.  It builds up to a climax which makes you want to place your hand on your heart and thank God and the brave citizens who have given their lives so that we may live in a free world.Much of the rest of the score is more playful.  \"The Radar Train\" is rather jaunty, and, well, train-like!  Giacchino uses his orchestra so well to reflect the mood of the setting in mind.  Various themes are repeated throughout the score \"John Williams\" style.  The main theme features in \"Radar Train\", in a slightly twisted form in \"Panzer Attck\", then coming back to a more glory-bound statement of the same in \"The Jet Aircraft Facility\".  There is a \"Nazi Theme\" too, first heard towards the end of track 2, and is scattered around indicating a threat of attack.  Other themes are interesting too, such as that used in \"Merker's Salt Mine\", \"The U-Boat\", and a glorious melody featured in \"Stopping the V2 Launch\".  \"Sabotage\" brings back memories of Williams' \"Scherzo\" from \"Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade\", but it is sufficiently distinctive in its own right for Giacchino to put his own stamp on.For me, some of this CD took a little listening to before I was able to follow each track through.  But what is so great is that whilst various themes are used, each track is very different and worthy of note in its own right.My award for favourite track would have to be \"Taking Out the Railgun\".  It's sneaky sounding with low strings at first, yet hints at bravado as the strings get higher and you approach your goal.  It builds up and builds up, increasing in volume and stepping up half a key here and there, becoming more and more tense.  I think that this is such a perfect example of how to gradually wrap a whole orchestra round a single theme and splash it out with cymbals, and build it up to a noisy, powerful statement.  I could listen to this over and over again, it really is that good.I suppose having not played the Playstation game, I listen to this with regard to the music, and not much to exactly which part of the game it represents.  However this score can be enjoyed to the full without the need for that.  Giacchino was given a free rein as he didn't have to tie the score to precise moments, and it's this which makes it such an enjoyable listening experience.  This score is for me beyond comparison to anything in this genre at the moment.This is totally, thoroughly superb.  Every track is an absolute joy.\n", "val": 0.019951263442635536}
{"text": "Sorry to burst the bubble here but this is in no way a four, let alone five star soundtrack. All the reviews I've read have talked about this score being `one of the best soundtracks in a long time...', `a great display of John Williams-esque orchestration and bombast...'. I'm sorry but not in my view. I would say this score is adequate and I can't help but feel that there has been a motive on the parts of critics to encourage more orchestral works into the video game territory, hence the high ratings.Some cues are indeed reminiscent of John Williams (Rescuing The G3 Officer, Panzer Attack) and there are some notable themes weaving their way throughout but the album does not at all develop them well (Merker's Salt Mine is just the same melody played over and over again - unforgivable) and the harmonies and orchestrations are often minimal to an extent that I feel John Williams would be quite ashamed of. There are so many tutti passages which in my view indicates either a lack of being able to write ongoing multiple lines of counterpoint or downright laziness and there are quite a few passages of drama where there are just strings and brass playing that any composer worth his salt would realise needed some woodwind to just make the effects fuller and more interesting.Unforgivably, there are also a lot of downright cheesy `Om pah pah' moments - just witness the really quite dreadful opening of Rjuken  Sabotage - which might be rousing for engrossed gamers but certainly detracts from an enjoyable separate listening experience.I'm aware I've focused on the negative points - there are moments of really good music (The Jet Aircraft Facility is particularly notable) - but that's because I forked out 16 for an album that had been given a good review from Movie Music UK (a site whose reviews I have a lot of faith in) and others and which is really now a non entity in my soundtrack collection.I remember the music accompanying games such as Goldeneye and Turok being far more effective and they didn't even have an orchestra...\n", "val": 0.00013884033251088113}

I had recently seen Saving Private Ryan, and while the Normandy Invasion isn't part of the first Medal of Honor game ((it wouldn't appear on the Home Consoles until Medal of Honor: Frontline)) the game was  like playing through the movie.  The atmosphereics were wonderful, the graphics detailed, and the Music! I thought it was a John Williams Score! The rousing themes, and the elements that give you the feeling of sneaking around as an OSS agent. Just fantastic. It was the first time I can remember being floored by a Video Game Score. This game had the production value of a feature film!  I wound up wandering the net looking for the score. I found it on Amazon when it was first released, but put off buying it until I had the money. By the time I had the money to buy the score it was sold out.I was none too keen on buying the score for 60-100 dollars.Five Years went by, and I never did get the soundtrack, until I finaly took the plunge and shelled out the dough.Let me tell you this stands up as a score, and as a piece of music in its own right. It is wonderfully orchestrated. I would gladly line this up with the score to Saving Private Ryan. It's fantastic.There are bonus tracks on the disk. The last two listed tracks are a reorcestration of the Medal of Honor theme, and an Atmosphereic ((including AM radio pops and static)) of a 40's pop song. There are alos two unlisted tracks.

{"text": "I do not know much about video game soundtracks and I have no idea who Michael Giacchino is. All I know is that this is some seriously good music that belongs in a film and not a video game, even though i'm sure it sounds outstanding while playing the game. This is music that is bombastic and fully orchestral with a military feel all the way through. The main theme is introduced in \"Medal of Honor\" and reminds me of something James Horner would write with a solo trumpet accompanied by snare drums, leading to a full orchestral statement of the theme. The other theme that is present in this score is the Nazi theme which is first introduced to us in \"Locating Enemy Positions\". This theme to me is the better theme because it is driving, ominous, and dramatic all at the same time. You can hear more of this theme in \"Attack on Fort Schmerzen\", \"The Radar Train\", \"Panzer Attack\", \"Rjuken Sabotage\", \"Securing the Codebook\", \"Nordhausen\", and \"Stopping the V2 Launch\". The highlight of this score, however, is the powerful and unstoppable action music. Knockout brass fanfares and thundering percussion are the highlights in almost every track. The only different track is \"The Road to Berlin\" which is a jazzy Cole Porter style cue. The Northwest Sinfonia with help on the orchestrations by Tim Simonec (who orchestrates and conducts for Graeme Revell), really does an outstanding job and needs to perform on much more film scores. If you haven't guessed by now, which you probably have, get this soundtrack! It's a can't miss!\n", "val": 0.008656580932438374}

After buying (and returning) the meandering soundtrack to _Episode One: Phantom Menace_, I thought those good ol' days were gone forever. But then a buddy of mine started playing a little Playstation game called _Medal of Honor_. As I watched my friend nix Nazis, I heard something I'd not heard in a long time: a rousing adventure soundtrack! Yes, I heard menacing Nazis, exotic locales, and daring heroes brought to life with music, glorious symphonic music! And by a composer whose evocative powers didn't flag for a single measure. O O O O that Williamsian rag! The good ol' days are here again, but it's not John Williams who's ushering them in; It's Michael Giacchino with his _Medal of Honor_ soundtrack.

{"text": "THE video game of ALL WWII video games, Medal of Honor and its sequel, Medal of Honor Underground, have the best of the best in orchestral sound tracks.  The music is riveting!  John Williams' strong influence in Mr. Giacchino's music is obvious......and wonderful.  The deep, rich big brass sounds are as soothing as hot chocolate on a cold winter's night.  I first played a selection as an online sample through Amazon.com and being a John Williams fan, and Star Wars and Indiana Jones nut, I knew at once I had to have it.  I became more cognizant of the music each time I played the PSX game gunning my way past Nazi after Nazi in hedgerow country.  My first full length playing came on my daily 30 commute to work which takes me through the Fort Knox Military Reservation.  Driving south on US 31W (Dixie Highway) the first track began as I was passing the airfield on a gorgeous breaking dawn.  Blackhawk, Chinook and Apache attack helicopters were silhouetted against an orange-pink partly cloudy Kentucky sky as brass and drums played in the background.  Chills ran up my spine as I passed The Patton Museum and \"The Home of Armor\".  Visions of tanks in the snow covered Ardenne Forest and landings on Juno, Sword and Omaha beaches flashed before me accompanied by sounds of artillery and rapid machine gun fire.  Then followed a fly over view of thousands of white cross grave markers in the Normandy Allied cemeteries.  This music could have easily been the soundtrack to Saving Private Ryan, Patton, Star Wars, Indiana Jones or the soon to be released Pearl Harbor.  The main theme reverberates throughout the soundtrack.  Visions of the game field run through your memory as you replay every frame in each mission.  Nazis cry out and fire as brass, drums, violins and accordians play on.  This masterpiece deserves great praise and a Grammy nomination.  A new Grammy category for Best Musical Score for Game Soundtrack should be established to honor such great music which, in this instance, honors our fighting men and women who served this nation and the world so proudly in uniform druing WWII.  Never has so much been owed by so many to so few.  They sacrificed their lives so that we might live in freedom.  Thank you Michael Giacchino!\n", "val": 0.02705279178917408}

The Medal of Honor soundtrack has to be the best soundtrack of all WW-2 themes. John Williams has taught Michael Giacchino well, it seems. Some might say, \"It's just a game!\". Yes, it's a game, but, listen to the music. Giacchino rises power, surprise, suspense, and glory in this magnificent masterpiece collection. If I could rate it 10 stars, I would. This soundtrack beats out the Academy-Award winning \"Saving Private Ryan\" soundtrack. In this wonderful music filled collabaration, you can hear faint sounds of mellow trumpets.

Some  will make comparisons to Williams, but I offer two thoughts: one, Williams  does not seem to write this type of kinetic action music much anymore  (okay, Duel Of The Fates excepted) and two, since when were comparisons to  a master like Williams EVER a bad thing?If you are a fan of Williams, or  even just a fan of good old fashioned action scores (regardless of their  source material), this CD will certainly deliver.\n", "val": 0.008523560129106045}

Never have I heard a composer like Michael Giacchino follow right behind the steps of John Williams. The only real difference I  can see between them is that Giacchino uses strings much more often the  Williams does. Unlike most soundtracks, every track on Medal of Honor is  incredible, and you have to have a lot of time on your hands to listen to  it, because you'll have to listen to every track! The German theme is a  listener's dream, and is a joy  to hear every time it suprises you around  the corner with it's swift and brassy tune.

{"text": "Very solid album with a good mix of rock ballad like tunes and heavy darker songs.  Dragonfly is probably the best song on the album with a very dark sound that starts out a little quite but builds to a roar by about half way through.  Turn it up is the second song on the cd and it follows Dragonfly which at first listen feels a little odd.  You are listening to a song that is dark and has apocalyptic feel to it in Dragonfly then change gears to a feel good jukebox bar tune.  Turn it up is a decent song just could have been placed differently in the rotation to make the overall feel of the album smoother.  The next two songs are the types of song you find in these albums to add some filler to the album while trying to strike a hit on the pop charts.  Neither one of these two songs manages to accomplish this task of a hit song or inspire more than a few moments of thought of its lyrical content.  But while they are not that lyrically strong they do provide that darker feeling you got while you were listening to Dragonfly and they keep the album moving.  Shine is one of my personal favorite songs on this album.  It is a driving song that has a very catchy melody and a screaming chorus that keeps you intrigued for the duration.  Devils Gift is a song that is hard to describe.  Lyrically it fits with the rest of the album.  The twangy guitar and the mellow vocals make it feel more like a Days of New song.  Still is not a bad song and you will probably find yourself jamming along to it if you listen to the entire album. Strike the Slate will take you back to the beginning of the album with more of a Dragonfly feeling than any other song on the album.  So if you like Dragonfly you will probably find yourself backing up to here this one again.  This one impressed me with all of its vocal work done in it.  Lots of vocal overlay work was done to refine this song and make it one of my favorites to listen to with good quality headphones.  The momentum in this song feels as if it is constantly building and really gives the song legs.  Say the same is the stereotypical song at the end of every rock album you listen to these days and is truly unnecessary in this album.  Through out the album you get the feeling that a acoustic song at the end was inevitable.  But i was holding out hope that it would not be so on this album.  Wrong, it is there in all of its self lamenting acoustic gooeyness.  Least favorite song on the album easily, but that is probably just because I have grown tired of this tried and true formula for every rock group out there.  The old make sure you end the album with a acoustic song so that you let everyone know that while you may be a rock band you still have a soft side is a little tired.  As I stated at the beginning a solid album and a fun listen.  Other than the last song being fairly lame my only other complaint is the whole album from start to finish is not even 30 minutes in length.  So if your a fan of Shamans Harvest Shine, you are going to have to buy another album fairly soon because you will tire of this one quickly.\n", "val": 0.0006696751806885004}

{"text": "With soaring pop vocals and anthemic orchestra-meets-rock arrangements, Kerry Ellis makes an unforgettable statement with her debut album, Anthems. I'm a huge fan of classical crossover music (i.e. Sarah Brightman) and have a fairly extensive collection of solo albums from various theater stars. Anthems is a standout project in both categories. Ellis is perhaps best known as the longest-running British actress to play Elphaba in the musical Wicked, playing the role on both the West End and Broadway stage. Many times when theater stars put out albums, they choose to record fairly straightforward versions of musical theater standards, not so with Ellis. Partnered with Brian May, lead guitarist from Queen, Anthems is an inspired fusion of rock-orchestra melodies paired with Ellis's soaring, passionate vocals. The album opens with the exotic Brian May-penned track \"Dangerland,\" reminiscent of \"Fleurs Du Mal\" from Sarah Brightman's rock-inspired Symphony album, with a distinctive Middle Eastern vibe. Ellis then moves on to a soaring, rock-tinged version of \"Anthem\" from the musical Chess - her voice soars, and the blistering guitar solos transform the track into an arena-ready anthem. Two tracks from Wicked make appearances with fantastic new arrangements. \"Defying Gravity\" is transformed into a rousing, rock-driven anthem of empowerment, while \"I'm Not That Girl\" is an absolute showstopper, one of my favorite tracks on the album. Ellis's powerful pop voice shines on this song, simultaneously both poignant and hopeful. Another favorite track of mine is a cover of the Brit group The Feeling's \"Love It When You Call,\" which is given a rocking \"girl group\" sound. I absolutely LOVE Ellis's interpretation of \"Diamonds Are Forever\" - it's great to see a classic James Bond theme revisited. Shirley Bassey owns this song, but Ellis fearlessly takes it on and makes it her own. The album ends with a pair of Brian May-penned tracks - a gorgeous, powerful rendition of Queen's \"No One But You (Only the Good Die Young)\" and the beautiful and poignant \"I Loved a Butterfly.\" Kerry Ellis's debut is a standout. The press release in the product description section of Amazon states that \"Broadway's about to get a little bit grittier\" with Ellis's debut - and to that all I can say is more, please. Kerry's powerhouse vocals married to musical theater-meets-rock-orchestra-fusion is an addictive combination.\n", "val": 0.039781972765922546}
{"text": "Queen's guitar virtuoso, Brian May, is a master in reference to selecting vocalists. It started with the iconic Freddie Mercury, then he joined forces with the wondrously bluesy Paul Rogers and now he has produced and played guitar for the soon to be a major starlet, Kerry Ellis. If you can fuse Kate Bush' voice with Carrie Underwood's voice that's how great Kerry Ellis sings. \"Anthems\" is immediately impressive and infectious. The opening track \"Dangerland\" is exotic and enchanting. The song \"Anthems\" has a major Queeen influence and Kerry Ellis' vocal performance is amazing. This song and several others are bolstered and enhanced by some majestic Brian May guitar riffs featuring his inimitable tones.Other major highlights are May's poignant \"Save Me\", \"the spectacular and rousing \"Defying Gravity\" and \"the sterling and heartrending \"I'm Not That Girl\". Other appealing gems are \"I Can't Be Your Friend\", the tender \"No One But You\" and the gorgeous and emotive closing track \"I Loved A Butterfly\"(Written By Brian May.I was pleasantly surprised and even awed by the grandeur of this CD. Kerry Ellis is a vocal phenomenon and once again Brian May displays his resplendent instrumental talents while unveiling the enormous talent of an exemplary vocalist.This is a bona fide 5 Star Cd.\n", "val": 0.04453135281801224}

Also I've seen a couple videos where he was singin' acappela and was just blown away. I go through so much music so sometimes it takes me a minute to get around to really listening to something. I took the time to actually listen to this album before I bought it. I've learned to do that instead of buying something and end up disappointed. I am very impressed with this guys progression. Most artists end up in a situation where they're always trying to out do their last album. With Jeremih it just seems to get better and better. I hope he's around in this business for a long long time. This album just makes me want to hear more of him. I think I got through the 3rd track when previewing this and said o.k. I'm buying it. I'd put Jeremih up there wit Trey Songz right now. What's even more amazing is this guy composes his own music and lyrics. I don't know if all tracks on this album are 100% done by him but even if they aren't this album is still worth every penny.

If you are looking for fresh but unique R&B hits with a sprinkle of Jeremih's infamous sexy dance songs (aka. Birthday Sex-esque), look no further than this album. This is real, genuine music!

{"text": "When Jeremih released his smash debut single, \"Birthday Sex\" back in 2009, I thought for sure he'd have a smash album instead he produced one of the worst debuts in recent memory. On his follow up while there is stronger material there's nothing of note that will help him stand out. The CD starts out on decent with All About You where Jeremih, echoes The Dream followed by the equally impressive X & O's. However the third track the 50 Cent assisted Down On Me is just plain trash and a little too vulgar for my tastes. The only other tracks really worth mentioning are the lead single I Like feat. Ludacris, Sleeper,Waiter/The Five Senses and Love Don't Change. I Like was released this past summer and didn't really get the attention it deserved. With Sleeper and Waiter/The Five Senses, Jeremih produces a sexy slow jam without going into the corny R. Kelly terriority. The closing track Love Don't Change shows given a chance and the right production, Jeremih can produce some quality R&B music. Love Don't Change may not be a strong ballad as Eric Benet's newest, however like his label mate Sterling Simms, it shows that some of the young cats can produce quality music. Like the recent Trey Songz release, Jeremih would have been smart to release an EP instead of a full album. When you have eleven songs and only six are good, it shows that you just threw some filler on your album. If Jeremih wants to compete with Trey Songz and the revamped Chris Brown he'll need to come a little harder next time.\n", "val": 0.00014014201587997377}

{"text": "I have always known who Jeremih was because his songs play on the radio, but I never have seen a video, read an interview or listened to an album. Listening to his sophomore LP, \"All About You\" helped me familiarize myself with this young man. While I enjoyed this album, it is by no means timeless or excellent. It's a nice listen, though. There are a few obvious influences from The Dream, and some of the tracks, namely the ballads, sound a bit alike. He has a high-pitched singing voice. His voice is good, but he cannot hold a candle to some of his contemporaries vocally. I would put him in a box with Trey Songz and The Dream vocally.Here we find lots of songs with sexual references, but subject. There are ballads, mid-tempos and fast tracks. The collaborations are few, which is fine. I once heard a person say that too many collaborations means that an artist is afraid to stand on his or her own. \"Down On Me\" is a club banger that features 50 Cent. It was a cool radio song. \"I Like\" is a ballad that he joined forces with Ludacris on. Again, it's a cool radio song, but probably not something most would remember in a year or two. Ludacris does an okay job. X's & O's\" is an okay song with decent production. In this song he is telling his woman that he is so happy to have found her that he has to give her \"X's & O's.\" \"Love Don't Change\" is a great ballad, especially lyrically. He is singing with emotion here.Pretty good album overall.

{"text": "Prime Cuts: We All Fall Down, Come Back Song, She's BeautifulHootie who? Despite being the front man of Hootie and the Blowfish, Darius Rucker has made himself such a name in country music that has made his days with the Hootie a distant memory. Not since Charley Pride has another African American country artist made such a squall on the country music front. Three consecutive number ones from his debut disc \"Learn to Live\" and garnering the New Artist Award at CMA have certainly firmly established Rucker as one of the mainstays of the genre. Sophomore follow -up \"Charleston, SC 1966\" ought to continue to give Rucker the same red carpet treatment of more awards and number one hits. Like his solo debut, \"Charleston, SC 1966\" continues on the same radio ready path of pop country with that occasional touch of southern charm. And just like his predecessor, Rucker has a hand in co-penning all these cuts with some of Nashville finest scribes including Brad Paisley, Ashley Gorley, Frank Rogers, Kara DioGuardi among many others.Inspired by Radney Foster's 1992 landmark \"Del Rio, TX 1959\" where Foster names his Arista debut under the name of his hometown and date of birth, \"Charleston, SC 1966\" follows suit for Rucker. While Foster's release was a masterpiece of creative ingenuity, Rucker's counterpart is less adventurous. Not that it's a ropey effort. Rather, the songs are mostly safe and radio-targeted. Best tailored towards radio is lead single \"Come Back Song\" a sensitive mid-tempo acoustically driven ditty telling the story of a mildly depressed man trying to win back his paramour after committing some foolish mishaps. While the age-appropriate \"Might Get Lucky\" tells of a frustrated middle-aged husband trying to juggle between the kids and some fun time with the Mrs.. Brad Paisley joins Rucker in penning the randy \"I Don't Care\" that bares all the marks of Paisley's patented humor over a light-hearted but catchy tune.There are a couple of soul-searching numbers including the hymn-like ballad \"We All Fall Down.\" \"We All Fall Down\" truly showcases what a fine singer Rucker is especially in his impeccable delivery and his ability to emote the feelings of the song. \"She's Beautiful\" is another gorgeous ballad that testifies to man's contentment with his life and wife. Harkening back to his roots, \"Southern State of Mind\" is a ode to southern living (such as sweet tea and opening the door for the ladies) that ought to put a smile on anyone who has ever graced the south before. Nevertheless, the breakup song \"I Got Nothing\" and the dark bluesy \"Whiskey and You\" border on acceptable without being memorable. Although the Alan Jackson-influenced \"The Craziest Thing\" has a tad of added Cajun spice to it that ought to get our feet grooving to its infectious melody.At the end of the day \"Charleston, SC 1966\" is a smooth, polished and enjoyable endeavor. And the songs all have a distinct southern feel to it that truly makes this as country as radio allows it. Nevertheless, the tracks are far too safe. It would have worked even better if Rucker loosen his grip on his pen a little--a few songs from other Nashville writers may elevate this from being relegated as a kiss radio effort.\n", "val": 0.008015631698071957}
{"text": "Former Hootie & The Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker reinvented himself as a Country singer, after the dismal showing of his brilliant but overlooked Neo-Soul debut \"Back To Then\". It paid off as his sophomore CD \"Learn To Love\" went on to sell over a million in the US.His new CD \"Charleston, SC 1966\" pays homage to his hometown and year of birth, as well as his friend and biggest influence Radney Foster. It is, he says, a continuation of its predecessor but I think the songs are even catchier this time around. Opening is the upbeat Rock-tinged \"This\" with a chorus reminiscent of Hootie & The Blowfish's \"Only Wanna Be With You\". Other catchy upbeat songs are \"Might Get Lucky\", the jangly banjo/fiddle-driven \"Love Will Do That\", and the traditional sounding \"I Don't Care\" (featuring Brad Paisley).However, it's the albums ballads that are a revelation; \"Come Back Song\", \"Whiskey & You\" (with quivering guitars and a nice pedal steel guitar solo), \"Southern State Of Mind\" (in which he tells us he's a well-mannered southern gentleman who holds the door open for ladies), \"Things \"I'd Never Do\", \"She's Beautiful\", \"I Got Nothing\" and the retro \"In A Big Way\". My favourite is \"We All Fall Down\", a truly spectacular ballad with powerful lyrics offering hope and redemption.When Rucker veered into Country, I didn't expect to like it but surprisingly I do, and his latest should see his star continue to ascend.\n", "val": 0.013415953144431114}

I've truly enjoyed Ms. Wright's vocal talents and musical aesthetic since Salt, and in this new CD she invites us to share in the root-base of her beginnings [gospel and beyond], alongside some very personalized secular covers [by some of music's legends] and two tracks with Angelique Kidjo that are surprising and grand.  There are also  some surprise vocal partnerings with iconic musical beings. And the instrumentation truly enhances and elevates the beauty found here.In summary, Fellowship feels like Ms. Wright is comfortable with the direction she's heading in life, her origins and her open celebration and love of music, spirit and sharing of it all.  I feel 'gifted' and sincerely touched by this CD.  While it is distinct for certain, there is no question that this is Lizz Wright, the vocal artist I've grown more appreciative of with each musical offering she graces us with.

Lizz is exceedingly gifted  and puts plenty of emotion in every song she sings. I like her song selection. This CD is not a traditional gospel CD, and I'm glad she didn't go down that road because it's been done to death. Just like Lizz's previous releases, the CD is a mix of various influences, with gospel being the predominant influence. I also appreciate the fact that the CD is very well recorded, and the bass is stupendous, especially on the first two tracks. I have seen Lizz live several times, and what strikes me about her is that her voice sounds exactly like her CDs. There's no need for the sound engineer to clean up her vocals. I highly recommend this CD. It has become my reference CD which serves as a example of just how good music ought to be.\n", "val": 0.031204791739583015}

So many good singers miss out on greatness because of their song selections.  If you're going to do a gospel album, then that's what you do.  One gospel song on an album that isn't gospel is enough, to my taste and I like gospel music.

{"text": "There is something about Rucker's voice that I just can't get enough of.  He's so smooth and the way he carries a chorus is unlike any other.  I remember when Hootie and the Blowfish was striking gold with `Cracked Read View', singles like `Hold My Hand' and `Only Wanna Be With You' hitting the radios and staying for countless spins.  I also remember thinking that something just wasn't right about it all.  It was good, but it felt like something was amiss.  Then Rucker went solo and switched gears to the country side of things and it all made sense.  Rucker, the frontman for Hootie, just wasn't feeling it.  Now he is, and it shows.`Charleston, SC 1966' contains a slew of great ballads as well as some uptempo numbers that show Rucker's complete grip on the genre.  I personally gravitate towards his ballads since his voice has such a smooth baritone that is complimented by those tones, but he nails some of the catchier tracks, which is shown on the success of singles like `This' and `Come Back Song'.  For me, `I Got Nothin' and `Things I've Never Do' dominate this album, showing vulnerability and honesty in his commiseration over failing relationships.He can't avoid the stereotypical `country' pitfalls entirely though.  A common issue with country albums is the clich&eacute;d and generalized `storytelling'.  This problem even runs into the songs I really love, but his charisma and vocal quality help keep them afloat.  Still, `Love Will Do That', `Might Get Lucky' and `I Don't Care' ride that line of `anyone could have sung this song' and I hate it when a track feels like a throwaway.  I want my artists to connect to the material and not just grab songs from a list.  Sadly, as a whole this album just doesn't try to do anything.  It is a very safe album, and while some of the songs are beautifully done, none of them (even the ones I love) are noteworthy for their creativity or originality.  They don't really say anything that isn't generalized in many other country songs floating out there, and in a sea that vast you really need to try and differentiate yourself.Still, Rucker manages to hold this album together for the most part, giving us a glimpse at where his heart is at.  He loves this music and you can feel that in his voice.\n", "val": 0.003911047242581844}

{"text": "As others have stated, this record is an homage to Radney Foster's brilliant album of similar title. Rucker is a huge Foster fan, and it shows in this album. There are times he sounds like Radney which is highly unusual. Both of them have unusual voices. It's a brilliant blend of soft pop country and very hard, traditional country. Rucker uses his unique voice perfectly no matter what he's singing. Nobody sounds like him. I've heard him say he decided at the beginning of this shift to country that he was going to be what he is. It would either work or it wouldn't. I think it works.Like most records, I like some of the lesser songs the best.\"Whiskey and You\" is a very unusual song. Although it has a pop flavor in the arrangement, the material is pure country.\"Southern State of Mind\" is a very cheeky song that pays respect to Ruckers deep southern roots. It has a lot of little things listed that will cause anybody who's from the south to smile a little.\"Things I'd Never Do\" is deeply moving. It has a big production with a touch of Nashville Sound. It has a lot of strings. The lyrics are very moving, though. Rucker's deep love for his wife is very evident in the lyrics.I'm not sure if I like this album as much as Rucker's first album, but it's still very good. He really is a country singer with his own unique style. He's also an outrageously gifted songwriter. He had a hand in every song on this record. They show his extreme versatility. I think we'll hear a lot more from him in the future. I hope we will, anyway.Edit: I initially gave this album four stars. After listening to it more, I've decided it's a five star record. It didn't strike me until I experienced what appears to be a mid-life crisis that much of this record is like a diary of one. I didn't understand the true meaning of some of the songs until I experienced the emotions expressed in them. This record has helped me move through that period and start to see light again. It's a great record!\n", "val": 0.02466699667274952}
{"text": "It's ironic (and sad) just as C&W artists seem to be crossing over to the Pop/Rock scene, traditional Pop/Rock artist are crossing over into C&W.  Case in point: Charleston, SC born Darius Rucker, late of Hootie & The Blowfish, where he performed as lead vocalist and rhythm guitar player has saddled up and rode into Nashville to release two C&W albums.The first album Learn to Live (2008) was well-received with the single \"Don't Think I Don't Think About It\", charting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.  The popularity of the single made him the first African American to chart a number one Hot Country Songs charts since Charley Pride in 1983.  The song was followed by two more number-one singles, \"It Won't Be Like This for Long\" and \"Alright\" as well as the number three hit single \"History in the Making\".Proving that Rucker was no fluke, he won a CMA award for Best New Artist In 2009, becoming the Black American to win the Award from the CMA, and only the second African American to win any award from that most storied of C&W music associations.Now Darius Rucker is back with a second C&W offering, \"Charleston, SC 1966,\" released in October 2010.  Thus far the album has garnered to singles: Come Back Song (track No. 2), which became the 4th No. 1 for the baritone, and; This (track No. 1).I have to admit that when I listened to the album all the way the first time through I did not like what I heard.  Produced by Frank Rogers, best known for his work with chart-topping country talent as Trace Adkins, Brad Paisley, and Josh Turner, I thought \"Charleston, SC 1966\" a shallow offering, full of now clique C&W tidbits inserted to make the CD sound \"Country Strong\" (authentic).  But then I decided to give the CD a second and third listen, and while my impressions of the album has improved somewhat, I think I still like Rucker better when he was fronting Hootie & The Blowfish; as least as a member of the Pop/Rock group, he sounded more soulful, more faithful to his music.This, which starts out the album, is an upbeat little number with all of the right C&W instrumental and lyrical notes, but it failed to connect.  It seemed contrived, with a false emotional undertone that left me flat.Rucker is blessed with a rich, emotive, baritone voice that is at its best unadorned by too much instrumentation.  The second track Come Back Song showcases his vocal acumen well, and the lyrics were not bad either. But Rucker's really comes to live on track No. 4 Whiskey and You, and track No. 9 We All Fall Down, reflective, soulful, somber ballads in which Rucker's rich tones are free to emote and connect.A less talented vocalist would be unable to overcome Roger's predictable songwriting direction and paint-by-the-C&W-numbers production.  When the music finally ends, there is little new on \"Charleston, SC 1966\" we have not heard before on any number of contemporary country albums.  And while that does not make the CD a total loss, it does make it much less noteworthy.  It's worth noting that Rucker takes co-writing credits on every song on the record, meaning that he's is partly, if not primarily, responsible for the album's largely predictable and mundane material.In an interview with Billboard in 2008, Rucker had this to say about his foray into C&W: \"You see a lot of people doing a one-off, saying, 'This is my country record.' But this is a career I'm trying to build. The people that say that they don't get it, I'll let the music speak for itself. I plan to do a lot of country records.\"  If that is the case Rucker had better find the same voice that made Hootie & The Blowfish such a success, because thus far it sounds like he has thrown his musical hat into the C&W ring just because and for me that is not enough to keep me coming back for more.\n", "val": 0.0011524289147928357}

While that should sound extreme, Rucker is easily able to adapt and with his natural soulful grit and folksy-roots laden sound, it was no stretch to hear Rucker play the role of Charlie Pride.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Charleston-SC-1966/dp/B003PON2GM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Charleston, SC 1966</a>&nbsp;treads no new ground, but I highly doubt that is unfortunate in Rucker's case.  Here, Rucker smartly sticks to the formula that helped Learn To Live become one of few platinum selling country albums (or albums in general) in this dismal music economy.  Why not stick to what you know as opposed to alienate fans, right?  'Charleston, SC 1966,' with that said, is not a spectacular album, but a solid one that is enjoyable for the most part.\"This\" opens the album a bit clunky from my perspective, where Rucker's quick paced lyrics come over as a bit clumsy given the fast pace.  Rucker's usually soulful and distinct voice sound a bit tamer here than expected, which is surprising.  \"This\" is  not a bad cut, but it is a bit odd given what the listener has come to expect from the talented singer-songwriter.  The production helps to redeem it, but the real redemption comes with top-rate cut \"Come Back Song,\" which is indeed a `comeback' from a bit of false-start on 'Charleston.'  \"Come Back Song\" features superb production work with acoustic guitars intact with superb riffs throughout.  The songwriting overall is much better here than \"This\" and suits Rucker much better.  Here, Rucker's soulful distinctive vocals shine and it is much easier to `get into' this tune.  The refrain is pop/country gold and just may be the best written one of the album.\"Might Get Lucky\" is by no means second rate, even if it is not quite as solid as the valedictory \"Come Back Song.\"  What I like about \"Might Get Lucky\" is here Rucker perfects the `country twang,' something lacking in both \"This\" and \"Come Back Song.\"  \"Whiskey and You\" gives \"Come Back Song\" a run for its money as one of the albums best cuts, finding the tempo slowing down and more restrained production supporting Rucker.  While the refrain (\"whiskey and you/ain't nothing I can do/but come crawling back to you/whiskey and you\") may not be the most substance-laden set of lyrics given the somewhat serious tone of this ballad, it is enjoyable and there is a `rousing' sense about it.  \"Southern State of Mind\" keeps up the momentum with a nice contrast of tempo and nice clear vocals by Rucker.  The chorus is not as simple or `tried-and-true' as say \"Come Back Song\" or \"Whiskey and You,\" but it is still enjoyable.\"Love Will Do That\" is an uptempo cut possessing a different sound from other cuts; it places great reliance on an acoustic timbre, which is very nice.  Here, Rucker goes for more of an adult-alternative sound, which is different from the country numbers, but this track feels second rate compared to the previous ones.  The instrumental section is a superb touch, nonetheless.  \"The Craziest Thing\" features a `tried-and-true' formulaic approach, but it is enjoyable.  It does not come over as revolutionary, which is the general issue I would note with this album as a whole.\"Things I'd Never Do\" and \"We Fall Down\" are solid, but not distinctive.  \"Things I'd Never Do\" finds beautiful vocals by Rucker and an awesome, anthemic country refrain.  The problem is that as much as you appreciate Rucker's emotion, it is a bit melodramatic perhaps.  \"We Fall Down\" has a nice cool vibe about it, which differentiates it from other cuts; despite this, it still is not incredibly distinctive.\"I Don't Care,\" which features country standout Brad Paisley is a better cut and restores some lost momentum to the album.  The production is typical country, but after a few `B' cuts, that's appreciated.  This track could have easily appeared on a new Brad Paisley album.  \"She's Beautiful\" is solid, though not memorable.  \"I Got Nothin'\" falls into the same boat, but closing cut \"In A Big Way\" resurrects some lost energy, ending the album on a high note.Overall, this album is solid, though not revolutionary.  There are good moments, but the album seems to be `mute' of innovations or new tricks.  Despite this lack to take the album `to the next level,' I understand and respect Rucker's thinking.  Next time out, I would like to hear him extend himself even more - he is MORE than capable.\n", "val": 0.005815931595861912}

The songs here show a writer/singer growing more comfortable with the style and genre he finds himself working in.

{"text": "First of all, I have been a loyal Darius follower since the beginning of the Hootie days through the good and the bad.  I have every album he has created, including the R&B solo album.  His success in country music is amazing to watch as a true fan.  I think Darius has proven over the years that he can sing anything.When I think of a really good album, it is one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through, not want to skip songs, and can listen to for weeks at a time in your car.  Charleston, SC 1966 is like that for me.  Some critics do not like this album because it is \"radio-ready\" or \"country pop\" or \"familiar\" but these are the songs that people want to hear and request.  Any given song on Charleston SC, 1966 can be a hit on country radio, and to me that makes it a solid album.  I thought the same thing about Learn to Live when I first heard it, every song on the album would have been a hit if it were released.  He will ALWAYS be criticized for being Hootie but he has made two great country albums, and I am very excited to see Charleston, SC 1966 performed live.My struggle now is trying to determine if Charleston, SC 1966 is a better album than Learn to Live.  It is a very tough call since there are so many good tracks collected on one album.  My favorite tracks on this album are \"In A Big Way,\" \"This,\" \"Might Get Lucky,\" \"Whiskey and You,\" \"Southern State of Mind,\" \"The Craziest Thing,\" \"Things I'd Never Do,\" and \"Love Will Do That.\"  Many of the songs I listed are upbeat and fun which is the kind of music that Darius likes to make.  The slower songs are powerful and convincing especially \"Whiskey and You\" and \"Things I'd Never Do.\"  \"Come Back Song\" isn't the strongest song on the album for those hesitant to purchase.  If you purchased Learn to Live based on \"Don't Think I Don't Think About It\" you will be blown away by the rest of the album once again.  \"I Don't Care\" is a typical Brad Paisley style song which is a sure fire number one summer song.  For me, the weakest track on the album is \"We All Fall Down\" it reminds me of \"If I Had Wings\" on Learn to Live which was the only song I skipped regularly.  If you liked Learn to Live, you will love this album just the same, it is hard to pick between the two.  The new RollingStone review made a great point that I will close with.  \"Say what you will about Hootie and the Blowfish's profound mediocrity -- their massive success was merely the launching pad for Darius Rucker's true calling: country.\" - Mark Kemp, RollingStone.\n", "val": 0.012743604369461536}
{"text": "I love this new music from Darius Rucker. \"Charleston SC, 1966\" is a reference to Darius Rucker's birth place and birth year. My favorite track is the duet with Brad Paisley. \"I Don't Care\".  This is a fun song is about living a carefree life drinking beer and looking at pretty women.  My other track is \"Come Back Song\".  This song is about trying to get back together with someone.  I love his vocals on this song.  The mandolin playing by Sam Bush is excellent on this song. \"Might Get Lucky\" is a song about trying to rekindle the romance in a relationship while hoping to get lucky.  A lot of married people will relate to the lyrics of this song.  \"Southern State of Mind\" and \"In A Big Way\" are two songs about what a huge influence growing up in the South has on his personality.  I love these two tunes.  \"Whiskey And You\"  is the prettiest song about alcohol I have ever heard.  I love the musical arrangements on the song \"The Craziest Thing\". All the instruments on this song are excellent.  I love the piano playing by Gordon Mote and banjo playing by Bela Fleck.  \"We All Fall Down\" is a reminder that people make mistakes and fall short sometimes.  The mandolin playing is played beautifully on this song.  \"I Got Nothin\" is another song about trying to prevent a loved one from leaving.  The lyrics of this song sound very honest.  I like it a lot.  This is a song about learning lessons throughout life.  This is a very upbeat and fun song.\"She's Beautiful\" is a song learning to love the inner beauty of a woman.

But this must be one of the most extraordinary operatic debut albums in a very long time (he had recorded previously just a nice but sugary easy listening record with kind of pop tunes). The test for any tenor of course is the opera house, but if Grigolo sounds half as well live as he does here, we have reasons for celebration. He was quite good in the live telecast of Rigoletto from Modena, where he sung the Duke opposite the jester of Plcido Domingo, but he is superb here in his scene from the third act of that opera, managing to sound tender and forceful, with the contrasting impulses of love and lust wisely balanced. He has chosen for this disc mainly very well known arias from the Italian repertoire, but makes them sound fresh and almost new. This is particularly true of the aria from Luisa Miller (sung most of the time with a beguiling mezzavoce in an unusual interpretation that just sounds right), but equally personal and impressive are his renderings of warhorses such as Che gelida manina (radiant with the excitement of first sight love), Una furtiva lagrima (sung beautifully straightforward as a sight of the soul) or the emotional but restrained (no hint of the usual self pity) farewell to life of Cavaradossi. The arias and cabalettas from Il Corsaro and Trovatore are both tender and heroic respectively. The less known arias from Gianni Schicchi and Le Villi in his ringing tone are quite a revelation.

LOL!!This is a very young man (33) at the edge of what I think just might be an international explosion of a career.  How long that career lasts is very much up to him.The fact that he includes Manrico's high-C dripping music from \"Il Trovatore\" is already cause for concern.  That is music he can look at five years from now.  Maybe.  I'm not even sure I would want him singing Rodolfo just yet.  His voice, which is actually quite beautiful, needs time to mature and grow naturally into whatever it is going to finally be.  Judging from this recital and a couple of other things I have heard him in (none, alas, in person) he seems to be in the possession of a rather beautiful instrument, and seems to have a fair amount of musicality in his nature.  So much the better.Signor Grigolo should continue to develop for the next few years in those smaller houses which dot the European continent.  He should resist, at all costs, being enticed to come to America and parade his stuff, like a trained seal, in one of American's Great Big 3000 Seat Singing Barns, like - dare I say it - the Met.Don't go west, young man.

Firstly the material is a good cross section that should stretch and grow an early comer to opera as it goes a bit beyond the normal fare - but not too far.  The voice for me is pleasant enough but has that breathy/gaspy aspect that can distract and I think Calleja is better for this class of voice. Its interesting to compare Vittorio's version of Puccini's 'Firenze  come un albero fiorito (from Gianni Schicchi)' with that of Juan Diego Florez&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tenor/dp/B000LC58EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tenor</a>&nbsp;to hear the marked difference and realise that he's not really in Florez' class. I was attracted to sample Vittorio's music further after seeing him in the Rigoletto live in Mantua version of the opera, where he plays the Duke.

{"text": ". . . but I will admit that my doubts (after hearing Grigolo's second recital) about his ability to project adequately in a good-sized house have been put to rest.  He will sing Rodolfo at the Met next season, and here his \"Che gelida manina\" rings out well enough.  The middle of the voice is pleasant to listen to, and if he loses some color as he goes up, well, better singers than he is have that problem too.  I'm still not won over, though.  The bottom of the voice is never really projected in this recital (Calleja's, by contrast, is solid), and I don't like the constant dipping and swelling into and out of that whispery mezza voce.  I know that it's hard to tell on a recording sometimes, but I still have my doubts about how well-supported his soft singing really is.  I don't have these doubts about Calleja and Vargas, for example.  It might finally be a matter of schooling and style -- he doesn't project a well-sustained line, and Calleja does, even when his phrasing isn't all that imaginative.  I did a direct comparison between Calleja (at 25) and Grigolo (at 33) in the sequence from \"Rigoletto\" that starts with \"Ella mi fu rapita\" through \"Parmi veder\" to \"Possente Amor\" -- a sequence, by the way that is heard to as near perfection as you're going to get on Vargas's Verdi disc on RCA.  Neither Calleja nor Grigolo is really near that class, but Calleja projects and maintains the line with firmness, clarity, and good tone, while Grigolo tends to sound fussy and mannered with his little decrescendo effects.  Neither one should have gone for the high hard one at the end of \"Possente Amor\"!  But Calleja was eight years younger, and sounds like the more mature and musical singer.  I read in Grigolo's booklet notes that at 23 he was singing in Beethoven's Ninth for Muti, and I assume Muti by now has veto power over inadequate singers, so I'm still willing to hear how Grigolo develops.NOTE: About that booklet: no texts, but lots of photos of Vittorio in snazzy suits.

{"text": "It is exciting to have an Italian tenor these days (the LAST one that generated some sort of excitement in my tunnelled vision was Giuseppe Sabbatini).Vittorio Grigolo has a light tenor voice whom he now asserts is a 'full lyrical tenor'. Well, there are some tracks in this package that are suggestive of this - mainly the Verdi tracks.I have, however, slight reservations on his bel canto work in the Donizetti arias, particularly the one from La Favorita.Grigolo handles high notes pretty well. It is just that his phrasing in Donzietti that does not some how sound totally 'bel canto' - if you could excuse me from drawing references from Alfredo Kraus.What is Vittorio if not a bel canto tenor?He may become a Verdian tenor in the coming years.He has that distinctive Italian 'squillo' in his voice that many top Spanish tenors lack - South American included. I don't know if Grigolo is a 'big' voice - from this recording he does not appear to be such. However, his top register is quite penetrating and focused, and if he could guard his voice well, there is a good chance of his developing into a Verdian tenor.As for Puccini and verismo, I am more hesitant. Grigolo does not, at this stage at least, demonstrate a 'full' middle register that is in demand for Puccini and Verismo. The middle register is but barely there - without being spacious or ample in any way.I wish Vittorio the best of luck - his voice type is apparently in the same genre as Polish tenor Piotr Beczala. It is not a verismo or dramatic tenor voice type.At this juncture, to say that he is on par with Beczala would be too much an exaggeration. However, with experience and sufficient circumspection, he WILL be there.\n", "val": 0.0008886794093996286}

{"text": "When Domingo and Pavarotti were young, they stepped into big shoes immediately. Pavarotti's tunning \"Kind of the High Cs\" album left no doubt that a voice of historic moment had arrived on the scene. Much is hoped for from Vittorio Grigolo, who began as a boy alto in the Vatican choir and according to his bio has studied to be an operatic tenor for sixteen years (he will turn 34 next February). But he isn't stepping into big shoes right away. He expressly takes his time, preferring to focus on the music that his light, bright voice is best suited to right now.  Other tenors who grew into Puccini and Verdi from Donizetti and Rossini include Marcello Alavarez and Ramon Vargas, so time will tell.What Grigolo possesses in full is vocal charisma, even at this early stage of power and heft. He sings with ardent emotion, reminding us that by the measure of the late Marshall McLuhan, opera is a \"hot\" medium, not a \"cool\" one.  Add to his virtues a smooth legato, evenness of tone from top to bottom, an easily produced head voice, and an immediately recognizable vocal personality (what opera fans call \"face\"), and it's easy to see why everyone wants Grigolo to be The One.  I'm on board, too. I keep reminding myself that Pavarotti started out in his student days with a small voice, according to those who knew him then. Still, it came as a relief that Grigolo had enough amplitude to sing Rodolfo at the Met and Des Grieux in Manon at Covent Garden. He's not as dependent on the microphone, then, as Andrea Bocelli. He can count his lucky stars that his voice is almost as romantic as Bocelli's -- as witness a myriad young female fans. the rest or us, although we are grocery store cats and harder to please, hear the promise of great things in this debut opera album, too.\n", "val": 0.00704758008942008}

He mentioned in one of his interviews that one of his voice teachers told him...\"sing big roles in small houses first, then sing small roles in big houses and then sing big roles in big houses\".  Sang a big role in a big house he sure did in October-November 2010 at the New York Metropolitan Opera.  I was lucky to get the last ticket to watch him perform his debut.  What a performance it was.  He was perfect as Rodolfo with perfect diction.  A refreshing change, to have an Italian sing this definitive role.  His acting was also terrific.  The house roared in admiring approval.To go back to the record.  A terrific compendium of Italian arias, well chosen and easy to listen to even for non-opera lovers.  His \"Una Furtiva Lagrima\" was sung with feeling and great technique but my heart belongs to \"Che Gelida Manina\" since I not only was lucky to hear him sing live on stage but continue to listen to the CD at home over and over again.  Love the whole album.  To tell you the truth, this aria was the first time I ever heard about Vittorio, let alone his singing.  I am already a big fan of his because of his singing ability.My money is on Vittorio that he'll be even a brighter star provided he does not overuse his God-given instrument to excess by taking up big roles before he is ready.  He is only 33 and the sweet voice is about to mature.  Please listen to this record for yourselves and be kind.  He is not Pavarotti, not Domingo, not Corelli, not Di Stefano, not Bergonzi, not Gigli, not Kraus et al., he is Vittorio Grigolo, an extremely talented tenor.  Let him be himself and develop into the world class tenor that he is working himself toward.P.S. Having dabbled in pop singing, thank God, he returned to his roots, opera singing.  The opera world could be heard breathing a collective sigh of relief when he turned down being one of the members of Il Divo.  He said he could become richer being one of the Il Divo but I bet Simon Cowell will be richer than him no matter how hard he worked as a group member.

Except for Mr. Grigolo.Grigolo demonstrates a voice with great potential but in certain arias on this CD, I detect an occasional lack of appropriate power and emotion at certain points -  his voice gets a little too light for my tastes from time to time, and some of the great arias on this CD clearly show that. However, let me say that of all the young, up-and-coming tenors, Mr. Grigolo, in my mind, stands apart from the crowd in terms of sheer potential. Mr. Grigolo, please don't take the full \"popera\" route. Stick to your knitting because you possess great classical, operatic potential. You have a tremendous vocal gift. I hope that you will someday enter the category of opera greats such as those I listed above.Regarding specific arias on this CD, here are some exemplary recordings that I suggest Vittorio Grigolo listen to as great models (of course, Mr. Grigolo will want to pursue his own unique vocal direction, but these recordings are great models upon which to build a firm vocal foundation):Oh! fede negar potessi ... Quando le sere al placido: [Listen to the great recorded version by Bergonzi]Una furtiva lagrima: [Great versions by di Stefano, Pavarotti, Domingo]Che gelida manina: [Great versions by del Monaco, Pavarotti, di Stefano, Bergonzi]Donna non vidi mai: [Great version by Carreras]E lucevan le stelle: [Great versions by Pavarotti, di Stefano]Ah! si, ben mio: [Great versions by Corelli, Bergonzi, del Monaco]Grigolo said he admires Pavarotti and he even sang with Pavarotti when he was a youngster. Mr. Grigolo, please don't limit your influence to the great Pavarotti. You should also reach further back to Pavarotti's original influence: di Stefano. Carreras was also greatly influenced by di Stefano. There were many great Italian tenors in the 1950s: Bergonzi, Corelli, di Stefano, and del Monaco among them. Study them, Vittorio, it will be greatly worth your while.I hope that someone will bring this review to Mr. Grigolo's attention. I'm already convinced that Mr. Grigolo has great potential and I hope he stays on the classical opera course. Mr. Grigolo may wish to occasionally take minor excursions into lighter pop, \"popera,\" and other musical genres ... but Mr. Grigolo, please try to stick mostly to your knitting. You (and the rest of the music-loving world) will be far better off for it. Best of luck with your career.\n", "val": 0.006216944195330143}

{"text": "Is Vittorio Grigolo \"the next big thing\" among tenors? Is he the heir to recent great tenors such as Pavarotti or Kraus or Domingo? This CD gives the listener a chance to decide. One reviewer notes having heard Grigolo in concert and that he is \"the real deal.\" I have not had that opportunity, so must depend on this CD to reach a judgment.A couple comments up front. For one thing, his voice does not have the distinctiveness of a Pavarotti or Tucker or Corelli, to stand out from others. For another, his voice is not a big one (not that that is a sine qua non for being an excellent tenor). But his voice is overwhelmed by chorus and orchestra in \"Di Quella Pira.\" Richard Tucker's voice was like iron rising above such sound. As was Corelli's. Nonetheless, Grigolo's voice is warm and smooth and his interpretations of familiar arias seem solid.In this CD, he sings works from three composers--Donizetti, Verdi, and Puccini. A nice collection of works indeed, from very well known to lesser known. A nice repertoire here. A sampling of his singing. . . .\"Una furtive lagrime\" from Donizetti's \"L'elisir d'amore.\" Smoothly sung, with no distracting mannerisms (Tucker used to drive me nuts with his catches and cries). Not a large voice, but quite musical. His voice has an attractive quality to it. He also shows agility, as he sings Donizetti's work.\"Che gelida manina,\" from Puccini's \"La Boheme.\" One of my favorite pieces in the operatic repertoire. . . . Again, Grigolo's voice is attractive and his singing fits this aria well. When he sings \"Chi son\" or \"vivo,\" it is a little understated. The high C? Musically hit and well done but not particularly exciting.\"E lucevan le stelle,\" from Puccini's \"Tosca.\" This aria can be electrifying. Here, Grigolo's voice seems a bit light. His singing is expressive, but I have come to expect some oomph when the tenor cries out \"la vita.\" Not much oomph here.\"Di quella pira,\" from Verdi's \"Il Trovatore.\" Again, quite musically sung. This is a bravura piece! He begins a bit too breathy and with too light a voice, in my view. The \"shakes\" are done quite nicely (listen to Mario del Monaco for something truly ghastly). When he gets to the \"repeat\" of the theme, he amps up and the singing becomes more animated. The high C at the conclusion? Not stentorian; his voice is almost overwhelmed by chorus and orchestra. Still, he hits the note cleanly and it is smoothly sung.All in all, this represents the work of a very promising tenor, early in his career. I am not an expert in opera, but Vittorio Grigolo has a fine chance to be a good one. . . .\n", "val": 0.018847648054361343}
{"text": "Vittorio Grigolo created a sensation in his London debut in Massenet's \"Manon\" in the Royal Opera House (seating capacity 2268) in June, 2010 in London and just made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera (seating capacity 3625) in \"La Boheme,\" which I was fortunate to attend last night.There is no doubt that this is a major operatic talent, one of the most exciting to come along in many years, as virtually every critic and blogger who attended either performance has attested to. (See \"Manon\" reviews in the UK papers--The Guardian, The Independent, The Daily Telegraph, The London Times, The Epress, The Evening Standard, as well as The Associated Press, Opera Today, Opera Week, etc. etc.  Also see New York Times  articles regarding his debut in La Boheme.)Not since the recordings of the young Jose Carreras have I heard a tenor who so movingly expresses feelings, and makes every word count. His voice doesn't have the warmer, darker coloring of a Carreras or Domingo, but has a gleaming, brighter quality, with a rapid vibrato that has a different kind of beauty and is capable of lovely shadings and subtlety as well as thrilling high notes.We opera fans who loved his beautiful \"popera\" album and have been wanting to hear him in the classic opera repertory finally have their wishes fulfilled.  Now, if they would only make a DVD of him with Netrebko in \"Manon\"...<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/In-the-Hands-of-Love/dp/B000MGVBJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">In the Hands of Love</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Vittorio/dp/B000GW8UFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vittorio</a>\n", "val": 0.023005543276667595}
{"text": "VITTORIO GRIGOLO.  Watch for the name to soon be on the lips of every lover of opera - especially the good old chestnuts from the Italian repertoire.  Grigolio is only 33 - a fine age for a tenor to begin to sing the major roles - but he seems to have it all, from strikingly handsome good looks, soul, rather phenomenal stage presence, and a voice that can fill a huge hall or reduce an audience to utter silence as he almost whispers sotto voce phrases. This is an important recording because it allows us to have a starting point (excluding the very popular recording 'Vittorio' that offered love songs about four years ago - perfect for that young age).  His technique in vocal production, the range of his voice that seems to find no strain, his immersion in the roles represented on this very generous sampling, and the above all the extraordinary beauty of the sound he produces are all in evidence on this recital.  He is amazing: he seems ready to assume the mantle of the next great Italian tenor.This well engineered recording doesn't have a weak track.  The orchestra is the Teatro, Regio di Parma  resident orchestra  conducted  by Pier Giorgio Morandi and while the orchestral sound is not the most opulent it is at all times in keeping with  the colors of emotional range of Grigolo.  The arias are all from the works of Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini and for now that narrow range seems fine.  But instead of paying attention to the minutia, the major point here is to listen to the glories that come from this young gold mine of a tenor.  No matter how many times we have heard 'Che gelida Manina' or 'Una furtiva lacrima' or 'E lucevan le stelle', hearing Grigolo makes them sound fresh and alive and transporting.  The same can be said for all the arias he has elected to present to us as his first operating outing.  Sit back, listen to the not only the perfection of phrasing and technique, but listen to the beauty of this extraordinary new gift to the opera world.  He is astonishing!

{"text": "Any real R&B fan will tell you that Donell Jones is easily one of the most underrated R&B artists of the late nineties. On his sixth album, Mr. Jones continues to show why he's a force to be recockned with. Unlike recent release by his nineties counterparts Dru Hill & Keith Sweat, Donell wisely avoids using auto-tune on his album. Instead he allows his voice to carry the album to R&B heaven. Driven by the lead single Love Like This which is strictly for the grown & sexy, the album is full of the quality R&B music has been lacking.  My review includes a track by track breakdown.1.\"The World is Yours\" - The album starts out strong with Mr. Jones answering all of the haters who may have written off in recent years. *** out of ****2.\"Your Place\" - Another track for Donell fans, it starts off with a intro from his mother, letting him know that his fans have been waiting for him. It has a Chicago steppers vibe to it. *** out of *****3.\"Love Like This\" - The lead single which didn't get the attention it deserved. **** out of ****4.\"Imagine That\"- One of the strongest tracks on the album. With this track, Donell is basically telling all the no good fellas, to man up and do right by your lady. *****5.\"Back Door\" - One of the first tracks where takes it to a sexual level. This is the only song that uses auto tune but only in the back ground. Roger Troutman would be proud. **** out of ****6.\"Blackmail\"- This song is kind of the fellas answer to Imagine That.  A strong song but it the sequencing on the album kind of throws the vibe off especially after Back Door *** out of ****7.\"All About the Sex\" - Another sexy slow jam for the ladies. The one thing about Donell, when he's singing about sex, he never goes into R. Kelly territory.  He's able to praise a woman by letting her know it's more than just sex with her. **** out ****8.\"Stripclub (feat. Yung Joc)\" - I really wasn't feeling the song, it could be because I'm not a Yung Joc fan, however the vocals save the song from the one star rating. *** out of ****9.\"What's Next (feat. Inessa)\"  - The production on the song was weak and it sounds too similar to the euro pop that Usher recently experimented with. The worst song on the album. * out of ****10.\"You Can Burn\"  - This is a song for an upcoming artist, I take it as nothing more than filler and since Donell isn't singing the rating is applicable.11.\"The Finer Things in Life\"  - After a few week tracks, the album picks up steam again. This song has a vibe similar to I'm Gonna Be or You Know That I Love You.12.\"Just A Little\" - Another sexy slow jam, for the ladies.  **** out of ****13.\"Oh How I Wonder\" - The album ends out with a message song, which to my knowledge is a first for Donell. **** out of ****All in all this is a fine album overall. Along with Eric Roberson, Donell Jones is one of the few artists without major label support making good quality R&B music. Six albums deep into his fourteen year career, Jones has yet to have a weak album. While a cover song or two could have been placed on the album instead of Strip Club or What's Next this is clearly one of the best R&B albums from a male singer in recent memory.\n", "val": 0.00465594744309783}

{"text": "Donell Jones is a bit of an anomaly in the world of soul music. He's well respected inside as well as outside of the business, but commercial success has eluded him from time to time. Part of the reason is his long intervals between albums (like Mint Condition long), and the fact that he was signed to LaFace Records in the mid 90's. Being that he was on LaFace, he always seemed like the odd man out. His music was decidedly East Coast on a Southern based label. Then there were his peers at LaFace: Usher, Toni Braxton, TLC, OutKast and Goodie Mob. It almost seemed as if he couldn't catch a break at times and when he did, it was due to his work with someone else. His biggest hits came from behind the scenes- writing Usher's \"Think Of You\" with Faith Evans and writing and producing 702's \"Get It Together\". His best album ironically became his worst selling album- 2006's \"Journey Of A Gemini\", an album that was all but given the cold shoulder by Jive Records. After ten years of dealing with major labels, Donell decided to go E1 Music for his new album, \"Lyrics\".It's basically the same old Donell with his interesting and thought-provoking ruminations on love and relationships, such as the case with the song \"All About The Sex\". In the song, he pays tribute to a woman who has everything he's looking for, so there's no need to stray. On \"Imagine That\", he urges men to put themselves in a woman's position to see the error of their ways. The rather amusing \"Blackmail\" shows Donell sticking it to an ex about her past indiscretions shortly before her wedding day, while suggesting a little hush money for the trouble. He takes on the role of the other man in the ballad \"Backdoor\", while taking on social commentary on \"O How I Wonder\". The album starts to lose steam in the middle with the songs \"Stripclub\" featuring an unnecessary guest appearance from Yung Joc, the tepid \"What's Next\" and \"You Can Burn\" which features lead vocals solely performed by his protege Briana Fry. All of the songs are produced by Donell except the album's best song \"The Finer Things In Life\", which was written and produced by Mike City, who previously worked with Donell on \"Journey Of A Gemini\". Overall, this album is good but could have been better- much better if the songs \"Menage A Trois\", \"Don't Trip\" and the acoustic version of \"All About the Sex\" were on the album's final tracklisting, instead of being relegated to bonus tracks. Still in all, it's an album worth checking out.\n", "val": 0.0006943602929823101}

If you own all 6 of his albums as I do you certainly know why after all these years he consistantly continues to make great music. His music and lyrics speaks for itself. The talent, patience, and passion he pours into putting out great music is evident. No other artist exist that gives me that (Whew!) feeling like his music does. None! As the other reviewers have said and I'll say it again, this is definitely for the grown and sexy that recognizes true talent and great music.Definitely go buy this Lyrics album!

So, I came here to order it about a week later and found that there were several albums I had missed over the years.  You've got to love Amazon for that reason. : )I ordered 'Soulsville' (along with the Sports 30th Anniversary) and I really like it!  I completely agree with the reviewer who said that unlike \"Four Cords and Several Years Ago,\" this album of covers SO fits Huey and his voice.  I've often describe Huey as having a very \"soulful\" voice - so these songs really make perfect sense.I'm not familiar with the original songs at all.  I just love the sound, they are very upbeat, Huey's voice sounds great and the instrumental parts are awesome.  The last song, in fact, is only instrumental and it still fits the HLN sound so well.

That is what makes it really worth listening to. Huey Lewis has a decent voice for this kind of music as well.  It's nice to hear a remake of these great old soul tunes done with quality musicians and a solid effort put into getting it right. Reminds me a little of the Joan Osbourne style of soul music recreations.  It has the right \"feel\" to it in my opinion.

{"text": "It took nine years for Huey Lewis and The News to move from \"Plan B\" to \"Soulsville,\" and it's time to travel back in time. if you recall, this is The News second stroll down a full disc of memory lane. In 1994, the band issued \"Four Chords and Several Years Ago,\" an attempt at tipping their collective hat to the band's R'n'B influences. This time they go a step further and head to the legendary Stax studios to get a little of that authentic Stax groove, horns and female singers intact. (Think Cris Isaak's trip to Sun Studios for \"Beyond The Sun.\")For the most part, they pull it off by pulling at plenty of the obvious picks. Solomon Burke would have been an easy choice to pluck from, but the band goes for a more obscure single \"Get You Off Of My Mind\" (which was a number one R'n'B single, but barely cracked the top 40. It was easier to cover \"Cry to Me,\" ala the Rolling Stones, or \"Tonight's The Night.\" Same with Joe Tex's \"I Want to Do Everything for You.\" Lewis has always been an erstwhile soul singer, even in his pop days, so the materiel suits him. In fact, the only blunder is covering \"Respect Yourself,\" already done to death by the likes of Bruce Willis. It's like o;d friends together for a good night of jamming.The only thing that bums me out is that Huey and The News have not issued a new CD for almost a decade of fresh material. Given that he hasn't done so since \"Hard at Play\" (1991) prior to \"Plan B,\" it would be nice to see what kind of song-stash they've built up.

{"text": "What were Huey and the boys thinking?!? On their first album in almost a decade, they've opted to once again go the covers route, releasing a collection of Stax soul classics. Thing is, this is the band's second album of covers over their last three releases, following 1994's FOUR CHORDS & SEVERAL YEARS AGO (Their last studio album being 2001's excellent PLAN B). You would think that, with this kind of gap between releases, the group would want to offer up something that's A) a little more substantial, and B) more representative of their overall sound. You would also expect something with a little more punch and depth. Sadly, though, that's not the case...instead, what it boils down to is the fact that SOULSVILLE is often nothing more than bad karaoke, frequently showcasing Lewis' vocal limitations. Much like Cyndi Lauper's MEMPHIS BLUES earlier this year, the arrangements and instrumentation are impecable, but the vocals just seem to be playing catch-up at the best of times, phoned in at the worst. Things start out strong enough with the bopping \"Don't Fight It.\" With horns ablaze and the bassline pounding, Lewis lays down a nice, relaxed lead vocal. The underlaying vibe is one of fun and joy, with Lewis and the band obviously taking the song's words of wisdom to heart: \"You gotta feel it!\" \"Got To Get You Off Of My Mind\" is nice enough, what with those killer horns, tinkling piano and sweet backing vocals, but this is one of the prime examples of Lewis' lead vocal just getting lost in the mix. There's laid back...and then there's comatose! \"Free\" is also a major misstep...the arrangement is just O.K., the backing vocals are WAY over the top, while Lewis' lead vocal....where do I begin??? Half the time he's just trying too hard (to be sexy, to be bluesy, to be down and dirty), while the rest of the time it's all just bad acting. A definite miss! And then there's \"Respect Yourself\", one of my all-time favorite songs. Only slightly better than, say, Bruce Willis' version, I often find my mind wandering as I listen to the cut, wondering what a cross generational all-female cast of, oh, I don't know, Bonnie Raitt, Melissa Etheridge, Beyonce and Katy Perry, could do with this song? O.K......but nothing special. \"Cry To Me\" is a prime example of when the album DOES work....more doo-wop than soul, Lewis' voice is much more comfortable and at home here....it never seems forced or faked. Sterling backing vocals only add to the overall perfection. Definitely one of SOULSVILLE's high points! If he had just dialed down his vocals a notch or two, Lewis would have had another winner with \"Just One More Day Now.\" (Or, if he REALLY wanted to flip things, gone out on a limb and done it a cappella, with just a lone sax backing him!). As it is now, it just seems melodramatic and bloated. Things rebound strongly with the silky smooth \"Never Found A Girl\", which just spills out of the speakers like lusty aural lava. Lewis' lead vocal is both charming and cheeky, perfectly cushioned by the spot-on backing vocals. Toss in a crisp, understated arrangement and you have a real gem! Another one of the weaker cuts has to be the disc's title track....while a lyrical powerhouse, Lewis just seems out of place singing this ode to inner city living...it's almost like he's playing dress-up! Nice arrangement, strong backing vocals, great story...still, a miss. Things bounce back with the energetic \"Little Sally Walker\"...what a joy! Lewis isn't trying to live up to the high standards of \"classics\" here ~ he and the boys are just enjoying themselves, having fun, singing and playing for the sheer love of...well, singing and playing! One of the disc's most infectious cuts! The album's finest moment, however, is the doo-wop-driven \"I Want To (Do Everything For You)\"....THIS is where Huey Lewis & the News shine when it comes to re-visiting oldies! A perfect lead vocal, pristine harmonies, swinging, strong instrumentation and an overall swagger laced with equal parts rock, soul and street corner fun, it doesn't get better than this! Almost as nice is \"Just The One (I've Been Looking For).\" Lewis' lead vocal is rich and suppple, swooping and soaring around the lyrics, while the arrangement crackles with energy. A definite winner! The winning streak continues with the finger-poppin' \"Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You.\" This rave-up really gets things going, but it's never too much. Special mention has to made about the amazing horn charts, both here and throughout SOULSVILLE....this album really is a horn lover's dream come true! Things get a little generic once again with the by-the-numbers take on \"Never Like This Before\"....it's not that it's a bad cut, it's just not...authentic. It's like one of those old paint-by-number kits...everything fills in the correct spot, but does it REALLY look (or sound) right? Not so much. SOULSVILLE closes with \"Grab This Thing\", a percolating instrumental. Upon my first listen or three, I kind of thought it was a chintzy way to end things, but now I'm not so sure...I'm kind of thinking it's a nice salute to a sound and style the band obviously loves. And I hope they keep lovin' it. I just wish that they had mixed some of the stronger tracks here in with a heavy dose of originals...it's clear Huey Lewis & the News are still pretty much at the top of their game, but their true, more varied, inner voices seem to get lost on much of SOULSVILLE. And when we just get one record every decade or so, well, that's just not cool.

I liked, but didn't love, \"Four Chords and Several Years Ago,\" and semi-expected this to be more of the same. But it's not. And I'm not exactly sure why it's not. Where \"Four Chords\" seemed like a move in a different direction for the band, (a direction I didn't think really worked) \"Soulsville\" fits them like a glove.I'll refrain from comparing the catalogs from which the tunes on \"Four Chords\" and \"Soulsville\" were chosen, and just say that the songs on this new CD are right in Huey and the band's wheelhouse. There's the same ease and sincerity in these tracks as there are on all the band's songs to which I've been drawn over the years.The band seems more at home recording these songs than anything they've released in a long time, including \"Plan B,\" which was fun, but seemed a step or two below what I'd been hoping for.Anyway, I sampled the tracks before buying, but enjoyed them much more in their entirety than in the snippets provided by Amazon. Right off the bat, \"Don't Fight It\" and \"Got to Get You Off My Mind\" could, in a perfect world, find their way onto the radio, as they seem to me to have the same multigenerational appeal as many of the band's early hits. But I'd never hold my breath waiting for the radio industry to make any effort to give this album any airplay. To expect that would be to give the industry too much credit.Rather, I'll just spread the word, rave about the album to my friends, let my facebook followers hear about how enjoyable it is, and just be happy that, just as they did when I was 20, Huey Lewis and the News are still entertaining me in my mid-40s.\n", "val": 0.008868697099387646}

Huey singing about a turd in a toilet would be 5 stars to them!I strongly encourage you to skip this one and purchase another cd From HLN from their heyday (1980 - 1999).On that note, if Huey wants to secure his Employees, why not release a DVD box set or ORIGINAL material?\n", "val": 0.006990138441324234}

{"text": "I love what Huey & the boys did on this album.  From the first moment - they did this project the right way.  The band studied the stax collection and then recorded this album in Memphis.  I heard Huey say that listening back to this album - it really does sound like Huey Lewis & The News.  I totally agree.  I would say that the band is tighter and better than they were back in the 1980's.  This project proves that statement correct.In terms of the track list-\"Don't fight it\" is the favorite song from most of my friends after listening to the cd.  \"Free\" and \"Just one more day\" may be some of the best work the band has EVER done.  The title track tells you exactly what Soulsville is all about.  \"Never found a girl\" and \"Don't let the green grass fool you\" are my favorites.  Finally, \"Grab this thing\" is something that you would expect from Tower of Power or the small world album.  However, I consider it a gem and a perfect way to end the record.Do yourself a favor - buy Soulsville and the two hidden tracks.  It makes you appreciate soul music.  But it will make you a bigger Huey Lewis & The News fan.  THANK YOU HLN!\n", "val": 0.048041511327028275}
{"text": "Wow, these guys really did the Stax legacy proud with this CD!  If you like old-style soul, or if you've never really listened to it, but are a Huey Lewis and the News fan, this is the place to get educated because your ears and your toes are in for a treat.  From the funky vibes of \"Respect Yourself\" and \"Grab This Thing\" to the all-to-danceable \"Never Like This Before\" and \"Little Sally Walker\" to the smooth grooves of \"Cry to Me\" and \"Never Found Girl\" (which can make the unmoveable start swaying) to the heartbreaking \"Just One More Day\" and the title track \"Soulsville,\" the band covers the genre thru the Stax catalog quite thoroughly.  Sports may be their legacy, but what they taken and created out of the Stax legacy is nothing short of pure magic.  What this CD has in common with their past work is that once again, every song they choose to put in the collection is great, and every song, simply put makes you \"feel\" - somehow it must rub off from the tunes, but isn't that really what Soul is all about.

{"text": "'Diamonds In The Dirt' is the second stunning album by spiraling blues star Joanne Shaw Taylor who is again given licence to thrill on her Fender Telecaster at Bessie Blue Studios in Tennessee with legendary producer Jim Gaines who records 10 new breathtaking original gems featuring Steve Potts on drums, Dave Smith on bass, Rick Steff on keyboards.'Diamonds In The Dirt' captures Joanne Shaw Taylor on fire with a collection of love songs expressing her hopes and fears forged from crash and burn experiences on her journey through life since her widely acclaimed debut album White Sugar. Cue acoustic guitar and deep smoky vocals like the quiet before a storm on 'Can't Keep Living Like This' and wait for the whirlwind to follow that emanates straight from her scorching Fender Telecaster and thunderous rhythm section that simply blow you away! Nearly two years on from her last outing and this young lady needs to get a lot off her chest as she exorcises the past with 'Dead And Gone' and sings of finding \"New life in this fight\" on 'Same As It Ever Was' before moving into overdrive and telling of a brave new world on 'Jump That Train' that is a real bone shaker! 'Who Do You Love' delivers some her finest guitar licks to date leading into the title track 'Diamonds In The Dirt', a love song which brings her smoky voice to the fore that is winning awards like Best British Female Vocalist at the 2010 British Blues Awards and it's fair to say adding female musician and songwriter to that accolade wouldn't be far from the truth!Joanne Shaw Taylor attributes the heavier sound on this album largely to her now living in Detroit and 'Let It Burn' and 'World On Fire' aptly demonstrate that influence rocking you to the core with the latter using a similar baseline to the chord structure found on 'Kiss The Ground Goodbye' off her previous album White Sugar. 'Lord Have Mercy' is perhaps the defining moment here though as Taylor presses the self destruct button crying out... \"I'm going down so slow\" and \"It's hope that deserts me\" while exploding into some of the heaviest virtuoso lead guitar we have come to witness from her yet, that may provide a clue as to which direction she is heading musically... amazing stuff! Having survived the storm... Taylor shows her acceptance of 'The World And It's Way' in a slow soulful tune that softly brings this session to a satisfying close.'Diamonds In The Dirt' goes a long way to fulfilling the hype and expectation surrounding Joanne Shaw Taylor who continues to fascinate her audience by remaining natural and true to herself (which is part of her appeal), although one can't help but sense that the best is still to come and no doubt somewhere down the road she will make the cut and shine like the diamond she truly is... bring it on!\n", "val": 0.020384065806865692}

{"text": "Taylor is a great young blues guitarist / singer / songwriter that came out of the UK with her debut album in 2009.  \"Diamonds\" is her follow-up to that effort and although it is a good album, she suffers from a bit of a sophomore slump with this one.  The songwriting is ok, but not quite as strong as her first one in my opinion with lyrics that tackle typical blues themes, but nothing really original.  The decision to fade out several of the tracks, just as the guitar is really kicking in, is puzzling to me as well.  Obviously it was a conscious decision, but where on the first album the guitar solos were a highlight on this one many of the solos never seem to get the chance to really take flight.  One could argue that this album is more focused than the first one, and depending on your perspective this may be a valid point, but to my ears things are reined in a bit too much here.  I realize I am being pretty negative, and I really do not want to imply that this is a bad album, but compared to the promise of her debut this one is a slight step backwards to my ears.  It probably comes down more to personal taste as I imagine there are people who will like this one better than her first one, depending on what the listeners personal taste in his or her blues records.  Taylor is still a great young talent that deserves as much exposure as she can get, but I still feel slightly let down by this release.\n", "val": 4.8045858420664445e-05}

{"text": "This is a reissue of two previously released CDs on Rounder, Louisiana Cajun French Music from the Southwest Prairies, Volumes 1 and 2. Has all the same music, but more notes. The notes alone would make this worth getting even if you have all the music already! More of Ralph Rinzler's notes from the time he put was working on the release of the two original lps in 1976! Great photos of musicians like Columbus \"Boy\" Frug, Edius Naquin, Aubrey Deville, etc. Lots of notes on the songs, including a fascinating account of how impressed with Edius Naquin, Austin Pitre, and Adam Landreneau Rinzler really was!The music in this set of field recordings came out on lp records in 1976. Ralph Rinzler made them between 1964-1967 in response to the success of Cajun bands performing at the Newport Festival beginning in 1964. Rinzler knew something was going on down in southwest Louisiana and he wanted to capture it for the Smithsonian.What was going on was that some of the old-timey Cajun and Creole master musicians were still around playing some of the most hard-hitting Louisiana French music you will ever hear.Austin Pitre's singing on this collection is great! I prefer this ragged but right sounding version of Les Flammes d'Enfer to the one on his Swallow 45, which is available on Austin Pitre: Early Essential Cajun Recordings. It's loose but in a good way! The scorcher, though, is La Valse de Orphelin! It's Pitre on fiddle with a wailing drummer, bass, and electric rhythm guitar. Interesting, too, are Pitre's remarks to the dancehall crowd asking them, in French, not to make any requests because they are recording for a man from Massachusetts and a man from New York, presumably Ralph Rinzler who recorded this and other field work following the 1964 appearance of Cajun musicians at the Newport Folk Festival.The Edius Naquin pieces are all historic and very charming, some going back to colonial days! La Ville de Monteau, for example, is about Napoleon Bonaparte being mocked by brave French soldiers garrisoned in Louisiana. This was before the Louisiana Purchase.The Valse de Platains sung by Rodney Balfa with the Balfa Brothers was recorded pre-World War II by Happy Fats, who was a popular source of yet another beloved Balfa tune, Les Veuves de la Coulee.The sound quality is quite good for mid-60s field recordings, and the songs are a lot of fun. Highly recommended. The music from the original volume 2 includes Bois-Sec Ardoin, Canray Fontenot, Isom Fontenot, Aubrey Deville, and Adam and Cyprien Landreneau!Marvel at the black Creole French sounds of Bois-Sec Ardoin on accordion and Canray Fontenot on fiddle. Very bluesy sounding! We are lucky to have these recordings. They recorded in 1966 for Dick Spottswood's Melodeon label, Blues du Bayou, which was later re-released by Arhoolie Records as La Musique Creole. Here Canray sings Bon Soir Moreau (not Hack a 'Tit Moreau, which is a different tune) and a bluesy Jug au Plombeau about the life of a vagabond. Bois-Sec does Eunice Two Step and Quoi Faire, standards originally recorded by his cousin Amd Ardoin in the 1930s.Isom Fontenot, a marvelous harmonica player, is featured on La Betaille dans l'Arbre, accompanied by Aubrey Deville on fiddle and Preston Manuel on guitar. Some few more of Isom's tunes can be found on Arhoolie's Folksongs of the Louisiana Acadians. Then Deville and Manuel are featured on a jaunty little tune, Le Vieux Bouef et le Vieux Chariot.The rest of the songs are by Adam Landreneau on fiddle and Cyprien Landreneau on accordion, with Dewey Balfa on triangle. You catch a little bit of talk after the first song, Rosalie, explaining that it's an old, old song Adam learned from Louis Lafleur. The emotional highlight of the album, for me, is the sorrowful tune Les Pinires, sung high and loud by Adam. This is hard hitting stuff!Adam and Cyprien Landreneau appear on Arhoolie's Cajun Fais Do Do and Swallow's Cajun Sole, but Rinzler caught them at their strongest and best on these recordings! The set ends with a couple of more lighthearted songs, Treville n'est Pas Pecheur, and Danse de Limonade, a comical song in which the singer lets us know that he got drunk last night so today he's asking for a glass of lemonade (or a dose of cure it all tonic Kary-On!)In the case of the Landreneaus it's down home music by people who did not play dancehalls professionally but in the neighborhood for the older house dances and soires. The music dates back to a time when so many rural people entertained themselves with cherished songs learned in the family long long ago.If you like or are curious about the roots of Cajun and Creole music, this album is essential for your collection.

{"text": "Warning: I am not Christian. I do, however, find gospel type music satisfying. The story behind how these kids came together is neat in that the guy who put it together wanted a different take on the style of Mormon religious music. The style is clearly classic style folk/bluegrass/roots and is likely not standard within the LDS church in light of the style of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The music and performers are sincere in their music and spirituality which qualities are evident in the music. It is, however, not intended to convert those of us who do not wish to be converted. I find the tunes which feature only female voices to be annoying because, to  me, they sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks. Accordingly, I just skip past those tracks and haven't put them into a playlist on any electronic device. I have found that on long open highway drives, the music is good company when late afternoon sets in. I also find the music calming in heavy traffic. For roots music fans with a penchant for all sorts of roots music, this should be part of your collection. For lovers of sweet Christian music this is certainly a must. For those of us who just like simple good talent, this is high on the list of \"should haves\".\n", "val": 0.012849526479840279}

{"text": "After a two-year period in which he was primarily viewed as tabloid fodder rather than the talented musician he is, Ronnie has bestowed upon us a solid and spirited effort with the release of this new CD. Surrounded by an A-list supporting cast that complements and, at the same time, pushes him to give it his all, Ronnie is back to remind us that the chops are still there. Featuring gritty, buzzing guitar riffs that showcase what he does best, as well as the signature smoke-tinged voice, the CD's real surprise is in the lyrical content, which offers a personal glimpse of just how Ronnie's psyche has fared through the turmoil of the past couple of years.It's a shame that Mick and Keith have elected to keep Ronnie under wraps on recent Stones' tours as well as in the studio; it's quite obvious the man can still play some inspiring leads when allowed the freedom to do so. Perhaps his new-found sobriety has contributed to this as there's definitely a discernible hint of passion and purpose in the air.Paying homage to the many musical genres that have influenced him throughout his career, Ronnie covers all the bases: rock, blues, reggae, soul, and a tender ballad or two. Recorded with an in-your-face mix (play it LOUD!), perhaps this effort will remind those people who have cast him aside that Ronnie deserves his rightful place among rock's best guitarists. Well done Ronnie...welcome back.\n", "val": 0.022327415645122528}

Ron Wood is pure talent; you figure he could grab two coat hangers and effortlessly play an extended \"Love in Vain\" on them; so what's notable beyond the blazing guitar work on the album are the very frank lyrics dealing with his personal life (names are dropped, if I heard right) expressing everything from contrition to gratitude to bitterness to glee, and the engaging vocal melodies pulled off partly by Wood but also, very creatively, by backup singers.  This may be Wood's most consistently solid solo album.

{"text": "After a very disappointing Not For Beginners, Ronnie comes charging back. He must have just felt like playing for real. Just like on his solo albums from the 70s, Ronnie rounds up a bunch of superstar friends like Slash, Bobby Womack, Flea, Billy Gibbons, Darryl Jones, Ian McLagan, and many others to join in. The result is highly satisfying. He chooses to lead off with a ballad, Why You Wanna Go And Do A Thing Like That For, because it's really good. Most of the songs touch on the ending of his long-time marriage to Jo, which fell apart from Ronnie's philandering and drinking. Sweetness My Weakness, Lucky Man, and Thing About You are from a man who knows what he's lost and why he lost it. The best track is Spoonful, with Slash, and it pounds like a jackhammer and is probably one of the best rock versions of the song. Sure, there are throwaway tracks; there always are on Ronnie Wood albums.

Songwise, there is nothing memorable here, really, really mediocre, mellow rock & as for the smokin' guitar work I read about in the other reviews here- I can't find it!!!

I have been a fan of Ronnie Wood's since the 70s when he was with the Faces/Rod Stewart. When Ronnie put out his first solo album \"I've got my album to do\" it was certainly an exciting time to be a fan. Although when he joined the Stones myself and many others were sad. We understood why he would join Mick, Keith and the boys. But Ronnie's talent did not appear to line up with the Stones at the time. Personally I kept hanging on to his next solo works.....It wasn't until \"Slide On This\" in 93' that I felt Ronnie was capable of producing an first rate unique piece of musical art. Fast forward to 2010 to \"I feel like playing\". His work here hits on all cylinders. His voice and choice of musicians go beyond previous expectations. The lyrics are real and appear to help Ronnie heal from a rough couple of years. If you are looking for a great Rock, Blues, Reggae and heart felt words ....Buy this record.

{"text": "Ronnie wails like he hasn't since the Faces era on what might be his best ever solo record. \"Sweetness\" is a cool reggae tune, and a rocked-up \"Spoonful\" pays homage to blues legend Howlin' Wolf. (Wolf's only major US TV appearance was on Shindig, thanks to the Brian-era Stones.)Woody's nasal Dylan-influenced vocals are OK-\"Lucky Man\" sounds a lot like Bob's great \"Seven Days\", which Woody sung on the '90's MSG Dylan tribute.  Hell, Tom Petty has scored about 50 hits, singing like Zimmy. Other tunes display influences ranging from C&W to Asian (the intro and late solo of \"100%\".)Overall,MUCH better than Mick and Keith's solo sessions, IMHO. And surely more palatible than anything Rod Sewer has cut in the last decade. Not to mention Carlos Santana, Robert Plant, and that lousy half-strength Who mess, from a couple of years ago.

{"text": "WOW!  Ronnie Wood wasn't kidding when he says \"I Feel Like Playing\".  The Rolling Stone Guitarist has released a gem of a rock album, that warrants attention.  It is refreshing to listen to a cd that in some ways is a throwback to that early 70's rock period, when rock artist's released quality albums with little filler.  I would go as far to say, that this cd should gather plenty of Grammy nominations as one of the years best.  Ronnie Wood has a smokey voice similar to John Hiatt, and he uses it to perfection, on such tunes as \"Tell Me Something\", the rocking \"100%\", \"Sweetness My Weakness\", and the ballad like \"Catch You\".  Every song on the cd is ear catching upon first listen.  As a Rolling Stone, Ronnie Wood, is meant to be seen and not heard, but this release prove's he is surely meant to be heard, and his talent is evident by this quality cd.  Maybe Mick and Keith should take note, that this release is better than anything that the Stones have put out lately, and let him sing a few of these rockers on stage.

{"text": "It's true. You can't make everyone happy all of the time, and you can't go back to the way things used to be.  It's hard to embrace change.With Rockapella's BANG, the change is prevelant... the addition of Steve Dorian, the introduction of AutoTune, the cover of a song written post-2000(finally!)and the various contributions by all the members of the group all are there to ensure us--this is not our grandfathers' a cappella.  So let's talk about these.I think Steve's a great entertainer.  His voice has a kind of rock edge to it and his energy is evident.  Yeah, the voice is not Kevin's, not Sean's, but it is what it is.  You know what, I hate to use \"it is what it is\" because he deserves much more credit than that.  It's not about \"replacing\" someone; it's finding another person to meld with, to blend.  That's not a replacement; it's an addition.  And Steve's blend (both vocally and physically) is pretty phenomenal for being with the group for less than a year before the CD came out.  So Steve's in and he's doing great.  He's a change in style and sound and I find that refreshing.As for AutoTune, those of us who have seen Rockapella live (some of us multiple times, I might add ::raises hand::) know what the guys can do.  We know what they're capable of and we are very appreciative that these talents are organic and need no embellishment. That said, in a studio cut, which most fans will buy (possibly after witnessing a concert), we can assume that the AutoTune is there, not to impress or correct but as a technique--to make the album more of a \"dance\"/pop album.  But what of the Bang listeners who are not so wizened as to the pure harmony of live unedited a cappella tracks?  I doubt it would deter them.  For one thing, others use it all the time, for effect or for tweaking, so nowadays (I hate to say it) it's expected.  For another thing, the majority of Bang is, indeed, a cappella.  If, for a second, I thought a non-fan would go to a Rockapella concert and be disappointed that the AutoTune wasn't present in live performance, then yeah, I think it would be a valid argument, but I don't think it is.A new era.  A new decade.  A new Rockapella.  Would I have ever said that Rockapella would never cover a song that was written past the 1980s?  Before Bang?  Yes, I would have said they were close-minded about the possibility.  Many of the songs they've covered were from way back in the day.  To tell you the truth, this comforted me.  In a way, it defined them.  You could always count on Rockapella to belt out \"Long Cool Woman\", \"My Girl\", \"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\" \"Paper Doll\" etc.  But, gah!, have I yearned to hear something new from them (excluding their self-written songs, I'll get to that later).  So their cover of Vampire Weekend's \"A-Punk\" (which, in all truthfulness, I didn't know was a cover but I loved it from the moment I heard it) quickly became my favorite on Bang!  Rockapella covering something released in 2008?  A new Rockapella indeed!Now onto the individual contributions... it's nice to have all the guys write a song or two or more, so it becomes more collaborative.  I will always believe that Scott is the strongest when it comes to lyrics, the pertinance of melody to the lyrics, and the linguistical challenge of their amazing alliteration.  He is the king at this, there will be no other (notice I'll never say \"never\").  He is another \"flavor\" added to the Rockapella palette.  His rocket-fired lyrics are expected-- from way back to \"Indiana\" all the way to the title track \"Bang!\"  This man knows his tongue twisters.  So yes, Scott's contributions are forefront and they ignite Bang.  That said, some other tracks fail me.  I skip over \"Baby Girl\" completely.  It's great to witness George sing it in concert but on the CD it lulls me to sleep.  I love Jeff's first track on the album \"Too Much\".  It's very fun and catchy, and I find I'm suddenly singing the song when someone says the words \"too much\", which is (not surprisingly) very often.  \"This shirt costs too much!\"  \"Is it too much for a girl like you?\"  Maddening!  But \"The Shortest Path\" falls short, and I'm finding it hard to put into words exactly why...  I'm thinking the melody is wrong for the content.  It has some interesting observational lyrics but they don't quite fit into the pacing of the song.  \"Shemibos\" (John's contribution) just rocks!  I mean, the reggae style breakdown w/ him and George towards the end is worth the price of the album alone.  Steven's song \"Malibu Grand-Prix\" fits right in with the Rockapella mode and is a great start for his career with the group.Someone asked me recently why do I go see Rockapella again and again... and the reason is simple.  They make me happy.  Their raw energy and talent is so infectious.  This comes from the days of listening to them when Sean was with them from when Kevin was with them to now, and that magical ability to make music that is so inspiring and energetic and so beautiful hasn't wavered for me. Not one bit. Scott's lyrics, Jeff's freakin' unbelievable vocal percussion, John's passion, George's lyrical bass, and Steve's rock-n-roll touch, it all makes Bang one of the best Rockapella albums yet.  That magic, that flavor, that happiness is ever-present in Bang, and whether you're a fan or just happen across it, what's blatantly evident is that these guys make some awesome music together.\n", "val": 0.013421711511909962}
{"text": "Ok...so a lot of the other reviews criticize the usage of auto-tune on several of the tracks.  Anyone who's seen Rockapella live knows that unlike a lot of the other \"artists\" who use auto-tune to mask their lack of talent, Rockapella's usage is strictly for a more contemporary effect.  None of these guys need help keeping their vocals on pitch!  Now that we got that out of the way...I've been following Rockapella for about 10 years now.  I've seen the line-up go through several changes in the time that I've been a fan and no disrespect to any of the super talented guys who have left the group, this is my favorite line-up yet.  The last time I saw them live, it was Steven Dorian's 2nd show.  The chemistry and sound was as if he had been in the group as long as anyone else.  It's not easy replacing someone as brilliant as Kevin Wright, but Steven is just as top notch, otherwise he wouldn't have been chosen to be in the group!  His vocals on \"California Sad-Eyed Girl\" are beautiful and heartfelt.I think what makes \"Bang\" such a great Rockapella CD, is that even though Scott Leonard wrote most of the great tracks, there are also awesome contributions from each of the other members: the fun \"Malibu Grand Prix\" from Steven, the cool Latin flair of John K. Brown's \"Shemibos\", the beatastic groove of \"Too Much\" and touching love song, \"The Shortest Path\" from Jeff Thacher and the club worthy dance jam, \"No Pressure\" from the G-Man, George Baldi.  Most of Scott's songs, with the exception of the title track and \"Hard Time\", have been in Rockapella's live set for a few years now.  After enjoying, \"4u4now4life\", \"Tell Me What You Want\", \"Nuthin' But\" and \"Tonight\" at the shows for a while now, it's great to finally have them on a Rockapella release.This album is all killer and no filler.  I think every track is solid and showcases the amazing talent contained in Rockapella.  With \"Bang\", Rockapella raises the bar again for contemporary a cappella.  I recommend adding this brilliant CD to your collection.\n", "val": 0.012902931310236454}

I've watched Rockapella perform live dozens of times -- three times in the flesh -- and trust me: these guys need help in NEITHER of those departments!I can only imagine that this decision was birthed from a desire to make their music more accessible by the younger crowd (I will admit that the mean age of their Christmas concert attendees must be in the 40s). Unfortunately, the boys lost credibility with old school, die-hard, and otherwise sensible fans when they used auto-tune on their record.

{"text": "This much Dvorak for this small price? It's a no-brainer! Dvorak is a fantastic composer and is a personal favorite of mine. The recordings included here are of great quality - they may not be your favorite renditions of his works, but that's not the point of collections like this. Inexpensive large collections are either for people who are new to a composer or for collectors. Here you can get good recordings of a great composer, from his most popular (New World Symphony, Slavonic Dances) to the relatively unknown. I have my favorites of several of his symphonies, but I would never have been exposed to some of the deeper stuff on this album otherwise.What I love about this collection is that most (although not all) of what is included is complete. A couple of the pieces are not, which bothers me a bit - I like to hear a work in full - but overall the complete works that are here are WELL worth the $1.99. It's more than just an assorted \"best of\" like I've seen for some composers (Beethoven in particular) where they just take random sections of random works to create a hodgepodge of \"greatest hits.\" This is the next step: not a \"Complete Works\" collection but a solid collection of essential Dvorak that is perfect for all but the most avid Dvorak enthusiasts.\n", "val": 0.02613428607583046}

Almost none of the recordings are the best out there, but they are all pleasant to listen to with no offensive interpretations of the music or, even worse, poor performances.

{"text": "This is another terrific bargain from the X5 group offering a great selection of music by Czech composer Antonin Dvorak. It is a truly huge set even by the standards of these \"99 Most Essential\" collections featuring individual composers -- 12 hours and 21 minutes of music, with a full download size of 1.18 GB. Especially at the introductory price of $2.49, this is an outstanding bargain featuring great music, well performed and with only a few exceptions well recorded.Dvorak is as good a place as any to draw an imaginary line dividing \"Romantic\" from \"post-Romantic\" composers -- perhaps especially because he was one of the first major European composers to travel to and spend a significant period of time in America. That act alone has a lot of symbolism for the end of one era in music and culture, and the start of the next. At any rate, he was certainly one of the last great composers of the Romantic period, and this collection is a strong testimony to that.It is always possible to argue about what gets included in and left out of these sets. In this case, if I could change things it would be to have a bit less stress on symphonies and a bit more on chamber music. At a minimum, for example, his String Quartet No. 12 (\"American\") definitely belongs among any set of Dvorak's \"greatest hits\". Some piano trios and string quintets would also have been welcome. But that is nit-picking. This is a great collection of great music -- here's a quick run-through by composition type.* Symphonies -- Nos. 2, 5-9More than most composers, Dvorak's symphonies have the strange habit of getting more popular and better received the higher their numbers go. By far his best-known work is Symphony No. 9, \"From the New World\". This is a popular crowd-pleaser that has even gone to the moon (Neil Armstrong brought a recording of it with him). Dvorak said it included influences from American music, but beyond a brief passage that sounds a lot like \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" and a precious few runs in what may be loosely Native-American style pentatonic, I'm not sure there really is all that much \"New World\" here. Leonard Bernstein once summed it up by saying it was a terrific Old World symphony, which is as good a description as any. This set has a sensitive performance with conductor Alun Francis leading the Berlin Symphony Orchestra -- former East Berlin's response to the Berlin Philharmonic, now known as the Konzerthausorchester Berlin.The 7th and 8th Symphonies often score comments from the critics such as \"better than the 9th\". They are both great pieces, performed well by the Gothenburg Symphony and the Canary Islands-based Tenerife Symphony orchestras. An older-sounding recording of the 5th by the Vienna Radio Symphony and a rousing 6th by the Swedish Chamber Orchestra round out the set of symphonies that were published in Dvorak's lifetime.Symphonies 1-4 were all released posthumously -- No. 2 appears here in another older-sounding version by the Moscow Radio Symphony. The symphonic performances are all very good in my view, although played by less famous orchestras. These will not appear on lists of the all-time great recordings of these works, but they are all well played and satisfying.* Concertos for Piano and CelloTwo of Dvorak's three concertos are represented here -- the piano and the cello concertos. The violin concerto is not present. The cello concerto is the best received of the three, and was written late in Dvorak's career, after he heard and enjoyed cello concertos in America. This is a fine performance by soloist Frans Helmerson and the Gothenburg Symphony under Neeme Jarvi.The piano concerto is not really regarded as a strong virtuoso work, and gets relatively little play despite being good music. I actually hadn't heard it before getting this set.* Slavonic Dances, \"Legends\", and other orchestral worksThe set opens with the Carnival Overture -- one of many incidental pieces for symphony orchestra included. It is a complex, well-developed nine-minute work, exciting and lilting in turn. The Malaysian Philharmonic turns in a surprisingly good performance. A number of other single-movement orchestral works are also included, including the Othello Overture, the Scherzo Capriccioso and the nearly half-hour Symphonic Variations.Both series of the crowd-pleasing \"Slavonic Dances\" are here -- the Op. 46 and Op. 72 dances. These were originally written for piano four hands, and then orchestrated by Dvorak at the request of his publisher. These are really Dvorak's Czech/Moravian answer to the \"Hungarian Dances\" of his mentor and supporter Johannes Brahms. They were the pieces that really established Dvorak as an internationally recognized composer, and are performed capably here by the Rheinland-Pfalz State Philharmonic.\"Legends\" is another early orchestral suite originally written between for piano four hands. The performances here by the Bamberg Symphony under Neeme Jarvi are fine.The \"American\" Suite in A major is an orchestration of a piano suite written during Dvorak's three-year stay in the US in 1892-1895. Again, I'm not sure there is really anything particularly American about the work, but it is interesting.The Polonaise for Cello and Piano has been orchestrated into the Polonaise for Cello and Orchestra, and a Rondo for Cello and Orchestra is also here, although in one of the technically poorer recordings on the set as the microphones seem poorly positioned. Waldesruhe for Cello and Orchestra is also here and played well, although the cello part is pretty weak in the mix.The early, lyrical work Serenade in E Major for strings, for string symphony, is pleasantly performed, although it is definitely not among Dvorak's more powerful works.* Chamber musicDvorak was huge in chamber music. It is a shame that none of his 14 string quartets or three string quintets is included, as there are some real gems.Dvorak wrote four (surviving) piano trios, and two each of piano quartets and quintets -- of these, only the Piano Quintet No. 2 is here, in a powerful performance by Belgian pianist Roberte Mamou and four (unfortunately) unnamed string players. Information from other sources indicates these players are the great Romanian violinist Silvia Marcovici, French violinist Ami Flammer and violist Gerard Causse, and British cellist Robert Cohen. A shame that these artists are not included in the MP3 metadata for this piece.The lilting Terzetto for Two Violins and Viola is the only purely string-based chamber piece here, and I found it interesting because it relies on the viola to handle the \"low\" end, at least making an attempt to play the anchoring role a cello would cover in a quartet. Definitely worth hearing.Czech players Bohuslav Matousek and Petr Adamec turn in performances sensitive and energetic in turns on works for violin and piano, including the Romantic Pieces for Violin and Piano, the Capriccio for Violin and Piano, the Mazuerk for Violin and Piano, the Violin Sonata, and the Nocturne in B major.Solo piano works are thin on the ground, although two of the famous Humoresques are here as well as two of the \"Poetic Tone Pictures\". There are also four of Dvorak's Ten Biblical Songs for baritone and piano here -- the only songs present.The set has none of Dvorak's choral/sacred works, or excerpts from any of his 10 operas. I would have welcomed some sacred music, but again nobody is going to be completely satisfied with selections in a collection like this.The quality of the recordings (with few exceptions) is at least good, and usually very good to excellent. Bitrates are variable, and average a strong 176-243 Kbps. But only the solo piano works and songs for baritone and piano fall below 200 Kbps. This is likely due to less demanding space requirements to encode single instruments in a variable bitrate MP3, allowing for a lower bitrate without a significant loss in quality. In general, bitrates are in the 220s and 230s.This is a monster of a set by a great composer that put out a lot of easily likeable music. Try not to pass it up at the special introductory price, but it will be worthwhile even later on. Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.01750883460044861}

{"text": "Oregon's Karen Lovely certainly established herself as a blueswoman of note with her rousing Pretty Pear CD Lucky Girl while coming within a hare's breath of winning the 2010 International Blues Challenge in Memphis.Now she broadens her credentials with a masterful follow up, Still The Rain, that should appeal not only to her legion of fans who listen to her on SiriusXM satellite radio and many alternative FM and Internet outlets throughout the country, but to a whole new audience with some different material.Oh sure, Still The Rain has some snappy uptempo tunes like Blues Ain't Far Behind, Cold Man Cold, and Ask Your Heart that feature Lovely's big, lusty voice, plus a vampy jump blues number Older Fool with some muscular tenor sax by Michael Vannice of the Dawwg House Rhythm section.But it's the ballad cuts that really make this CD so appealing, where Karen Lovely throws the glove down and shows us her tender and emotional side. The title tune, Still The Rain, is a dark and foreboding tale of spousal abuse, while Karen will make you shiver as her voice drips with sadness on Other Plans accompanied by Vannice's haunting tenor.An added plus is guitarist Alan Mirikitani who spices up many of the songs with some gritty solos.Producer Dennis Walker has definitely brought out the best in Karen Lovely on Still The Rain.Sunshine DennisEntertainment Editor Emeritus, Key West Morning Star\n", "val": 0.03017551079392433}

{"text": "I was super excited about getting this.  However, I was kind of disappointed upon getting this.On the cd, Phil is hard to listen to.  Sure, with this kind of music, you're bound to have a few rough notes.  But it's bad, IMO.  He's not on point with the vocals.  He is way off key at times, and other times he's close enough (like some of the stuff from NOLA, where the rough/growl is ok).  Jail is especially bad, it's hard to listen to.  Perhaps this was during Phil's drug/alcohol abuse period; it certainly sounds like it.  He sounded much better on the the studio albums.  The music is good, but at times, the guitars are toney-thin.  Otherwise, the music is ok.On the DVD, the sound is a little better, even some of Phil's vocals.  However, you get three different video clips during one song.  I had hoped that it would be the song at one specific show.  Turns out it's not.  Still cool to see.  I haven't seen the shenanigans part yet.Don't get me wrong, I love that they FINALLY released it.  I love their music, and I'd go to see them when they came to town (or close enough).  But is this their best effort?  Did they not have better shows to put forth?  I wish they had waited and added some Down III stuff, or did some post Phil rehab shows where he actually puts more effort in to singing the vocals.\n", "val": 0.0027621786575764418}

{"text": "A first thought I had after listening to this was, does it deserve five stars for what it is, or four for what it isn't?  It does seem strange that a few years after their last studio album, they put out a live album from 2006, so obviously you won't hear anything from Down III.  Despite having no recent or new material, any Down fan would agree that live Down is awesome.  So I'll settle in the middle at four-and-a-half, plus Phil's voice is subpar at times.  I think he sounds adequate-to-great on most of the songs, but you get occasional moments like Jail, where he's not so good.  In between songs, you get trademark Anselmo goofiness and profanity, which is always amusing.  Anyway, listening to old Down songs takes me back in a good way, and the band sounds great on this.  Since they chose not to release a definitive live album, with more recent performances mixed in, I'm glad they did a CD/DVD combo, so that you at least get both audio and video of the songs. I'm sure most Down fans will highly enjoy Diary of a Mad Band.\n", "val": 0.030239077284932137}

This double cd/dvd combo has a ton of live stuff from England and the rest of Europe during the year of VI(2006).I was hoping Down's complete performance at Download Festival 2006 would be on there but, unfortunately, \"Bury Me In Smoke\" is the only one.  You'll get some rare live songs like \"The Seed\", \"Temptation's Wings\", and \"There's Something On My Side\", which is awesome.  There's a total of 17 live vids on the dvd. There's also about 10 minutes of shananigans showing the band goofing off:)NEGATIVESI'll offend some people by saying this but Phil is definitely not on in these live recordings.  It's a shame too because the music is great. He looks/sounds pretty wasted most of the time.  You'll hear some of Phil's drunk ramblings in between songs unfortunately.  The video quality is nothing special  either.  Some of the angles remind me of a bootleg.  There's also couple of filler tracks I could have lived without: \"Lies\" and \"Learn From This Mistake\".  I'd rather have some newer live material like \"Nothing In Return\", \"Beneath The Tides\", \"Mourn\" and \"On March The Saints\" from \"Over The Under\". But since this is pre-\"Over The Under\", what can ya do?For the cheap price, this is definitely a steal. It's great to hear/see Down live besides the bootlegs I have.

{"text": "Recorded at a couple of pit stops in Germany, the Netherlands, Glasgow Scotland, Paris, Oslo, Stockholm, Denmark, Ireland, and six different English cities (Birmingham, Nottingham, Manchester, Newcastle, London, and Donington), the first live release from NOLA-based sludge/doom metal supergroup Down is spread out over the course of sixteen tracks and two separate discs. It is a weighty metal feast, that is for sure, but also one extremely satisfying and enjoyable one, and one that is overflowing with the good stuff: Great riffs, solos, and frontman Phil Anselmo's household wail. And 2010's \"Diary Of A Mad Band\" is also sparked with an excellent, palpable, and inescapable live energy, though each and every one of these songs is also flawlessly performed.Tracks like the opening \"Losing All\" are fat with big, beefy, grinding riffage and wailing vocals, but are also peppered with a good batch of unorthodoxly ripping guitar soloing. This number is also of note for featuring quite a bit of crowd interaction, because it is one where Phil lets the concert-goers sing its chorus. \"Lifer\" goes out to \"Dimebag Darrell,\" and very appropriately so, too, because it is an up-tempo, deeply grooving riff-fest with plenty of noteworthy, wah-tinged lead/solo work to go along with its brutal guitar licks and cool, shrieking vocals. And later cuts like \"Rehab,\" which begins with the sound of Phil informing the crowd that he's taping the show, is very similar to \"Lifer,\" except that it has crashing cymbal rides in place of vocal shrieks.Nearing the mid-section, Phil begins the next song, \"Temptations Wings\" by saying \"not to be effing generic or anything, but are you having a good time?!\" And really, it is almost impossible not to have one once you have heard this tune's serrated, grinding riffs, and the Down frontman's glorious, household wailing/screaming. Track six, \"Ghosts Along The Mississippi,\" might begin with an unnecessarily long intro, but once it dissolves into a white-hot ball of buzzsaw riffing and ripping soloing, it becomes very clear that it is another big standout. \"Learn From This Mistake\" is a slow-burning, low-key, and very brooding doom metal dirge peppered with some wailing, and totally air-guitar-able leads and solos, thus making it another standout; and \"Hail The Leaf,\" which is stuffed to the gills with chunky, chugging guitar licks, is another. (Although the latter of these two tunes is actually mostly of note for being a song that Down had not played live in a long time, and actually not even once overseas.)Moving along, the first disc closes with one of its biggest highlights in \"New Orleans Is A Dying Ho,\" which again overflows with pounding doom riffs, whammy-bar-inflected leads, and fiery, inspiring solos. But this track is also of note for featuring quite a bit of crowd-involvement, as Phil leaves plenty of room in it for the crowd to sing part of the song's chorus.The second disc opens on a misleading note, with \"Lies, I Don't Know What They Say, But...\" being backed by an ominous, bass-driven plod. But immediately following it, we are introduced to the big, fat, chugging riffage, grinding rhythms, pounding skins of the brutal bruiser that ensues in \"Underneath Everything.\" A noteworthy solo also comes ripping through, here, too. Then, Anselmo tells the audience that he demands to \"see this place go berserk,\" an easy task, too, when considering this up-tempo fist pumper features lots of excellent riffs and solos.Other highlights of the second disc include the really jazzy and bluesy \"Eyes Of The south\" (which \"goes out to a brother of ours: Mike Williams of Eyehategod\") that is immediately offset by an ensuing brutal, and booming riff-fest in \"Stone The Crows\"; and the set closer, \"Bury Me In Smoke.\" This one begins on a mildly comical note, as it is introduced with the joke that it is a Green Day cover. And \"Bury Me...\" is also of note because it, too, just oozes with amazing, serrated sludge/doom metal riffing.\"Diary Of A Mad Band\" serves as a great companion release to Down's excellent 2007 release, \"Over The Under,\" and a satisfying snack for you to listen to while the band is on one of its inexplicably extensive hiatuses. So even though it cannot be said to be a mandatory purchase, it is a worthwhile one for all hardcore fans of the band.\n", "val": 0.026200154796242714}

Phil's abrasive in his ramblings telling people to \"stop the clapping $#it and just shut up and listen\" to Challenging them to a fight lol. Either way Phil's Phil and he's a great front-man with a fantastic voice and one hell of a delivery style. The band is solid, Pepper and Rex are always great and Kirk and Jimmy are great as well. I don't care what anyone says, Down is a band that has more Sabbath based roots than southern rock roots sorry. Their Vibe and style is very much in the old school Sabbath vibe which is fine by me as Sabbath is one of my all time favorite bands.This live release is a very cool listen. You get to really hear what these guys are all about live and its a very cool ride. Yeah some people are put off by Phil's drunken ramblings etc, yet in some ways, these rambling are what make this band a more interesting live listen as you're not going to find that anywhere else now are you! Anyone can put out a live cd, but nobody can match what Phil has to say in between the tunes. Like those commercials use to say, parking for the show $15.00, tickets to the show, $80.00, seeing one of your favorite bands live and listening to Phil's ramblings, priceless! As others have stated, they are some bad notes here and there, but the overall performance is actually quit good. Phil sings out of key a few times especially near the end of disc two on Jail, yikes that's pretty bad. Again it's Down and not some corporate money well spend so get over it.The DVD is a nice extra and it does have some cool things on it. The concert footage is ok nothing spectacular and the back stage stuff is funny at times, but again nothing that's earth shattering.

A lot of people have mentioned Phil's vocals and yes,his voice doesn't sound like it did in Pantera,but this isn't Pantera. It's Down.Phil is an extremely verastile vocalist,he can belt out \"Lysergic Funeral Procession\" then give deep,blusey,soulful vocals on a song like \"Learn From This Mistake\" and howl out \"New Orleans Is a Dying Whore\".Kirk and Pepper are easily two of the best riffers alive. Their guitar tone is huge,chugging,doom-y and if they make a mistake throughout the recording,I haven't noticed it.Rex Brown is probably the most underrated member of Down. His bass tone fits the music perfectly and his bass parts are always right on.Last but not leat is the Godfather of Southern Metal,Mr. Jimmy Bower himself. Though mainly known for his guitar work in Eyehategod,he is a sorely underrated drummer. He hits hard,keeps perfect time,and plays every song like it's the last time he'll ever get to play the drums.Overall,this DVD/CD is highly reccomended.

The songs you'd expect to hear are here, such as \"Lifer\", \"Losing All\", \"Ghosts Along the Mississippi\", and \"Stone the Crow\", but the set list isn't the flaw here.  Vocalist Phil Anselmo's voice manages to go from booming one minute to sounding terrible the next.  It is obvious during some of Phil's on-stage ramblings that he's a little inebriated, and that all the years of booze, smokes, and drugs may have caught up with his voice.  It's sad really, considering that it was his work with Down that really showed-off how talented a singer Phil could be, but other than his failing voice, the band itself sounds great.  The included DVD features some cool footage of the band performing, as well as some brief snippets of them fooling around as well.

When it comes to works of art, as vast as the array may be, there are two primary categories that apply to all: (1) work that is created as an expression and extension of emotion, or (2) product that is derived out of passion for the all mighty dollar.

{"text": "Sufjan Stevens is one of the most interesting musicians that I know of. The fifty states project, a symphony devoted to an expressway, Christmas EP's, the list of intrigue goes on and on. After dabbling back and forth with the idea of ending his public music career for the last couple years, his All Delighted People EP surprised the heck out of most of us. Then the announcement came about The Age of Adz, and years of built of anticipation have culminated into this LP. No, I'm not exaggerating.Technically Sufjan Stevens has released several projects since his earth shattering Illinois album, but this is the first one people are truly looking at. It's not outtakes, remixes, a compilation, an EP, or symphony. It's a bonafide, brand new, traditional album with lyrics, music, and interesting cover art. This album does exactly what it needs to do.Though to most people it will probably not hold up in comparison to Illinois, in terms of importance I see the two albums of equal. As if he needed to do so, this album PROVES Stevens' unending skill at songwriting while at the same time exploring new territory. Do many other musicians maintain the balance between creativity and originality as well as Sufjan? I can't think of an example.I'm not going to go through each song or award the album a number out of ten; there are probably 9000 websites you can go to for that. I am going to say, however, that this album is a spectacular work of art, one of the best albums I have ever listened to, and does not disappoint at all. It's different, but in the sense that each Jones soda flavor is unique yet equally satisfying. The five minutes or so starting at 13:00 of the track \"Impossible Soul\" are possibly the best five minutes my ears have consumed in years.\n", "val": 0.0394054651260376}
{"text": "4.5 starsThe new album by the \"coolest musician in America\" (Sunday Times) starts off by flattering to deceive. \"Futile Devices\" the opening track to Sufjan Stevens new set of songs could have happily appeared on the outstanding \"Seven Swans\" and is a gentle bubbling track with a fragile folksy beauty which Stevens can appear to evoke with consummate ease. So then Stevens is clearly going to compensate for his abandonment of his 50 state album cycle promise with a return to earlier glories?No such chance, indeed while the \"\"he Age of Adz\" has many transcendent moments, this is primarily an album of electronic soundscapes, whose trajectory can be loosely traced back in Stevens musical past to 2002's largely electronic Chinese Zodiac concept album \"Enjoy your Rabbit\". It is therefore not surprising that the critical reception to this album thus far has been in places bemused and quizzical (and in Uncut's case characterised by outright hostility questioning whether our hero is \"a genius or just a show off\").The line between originality and over indulgence is of course a thin one but in Stevens case his ability to make his music soar is the special ingredient. For example the second track \"Too much\" is Sufjan Stevens meets Yeasayer and a joyous electronic concoction. The funky electronica of \"I walked\" revolves around a trip hop big synth loop, combined with Stevens trademark angelic vocals and surreal lyrics where he asks \"Lover, will you look from me now/I'm already dead/but I've come to explain/why I left such a mess on the floor\". Other highlights also include the gently rolling 'Vesuvius' which concentrates on giving self advice and messages to himself plus \"Bad communication\" a short beautiful fragment of a song. The title track is alternatively; erm what's the word I'm looking for, yes thats it ....mental! A tribute of sorts to the weird abstract art of Louisiana based Royal Robertson it starts off with great Wagnerian voices then Stevens singing through cat calls and symphonic whistles over an eight minute hodgepodge powerhouse that has to heard to be believed not least the lovely acoustic end.And then we have the final track the 25 minute (I kid you not!) \"The Impossible Soul\" which is a mini album in its own right and a sort of Tubular Bells for the Twitter Generation which wanders far and wide. It starts conventionally and then leads into a strange exhortation where Stevens cheekily pleads with us \"Don't be distracted\", has a lovely vocoder section, at 13 minutes sounds like Kraftwerk for 30 seconds and then has one of those \"Illinois\" style chants for a further 8 minutes around the refrain of \"boy we can do much more together\" underpinned by all sort of beeps, electronic synths and weird machinations. It finishes with a fairly straightforward but gorgeous Stevens song with the \"boy\" lyrical refrain back again. Oh look, listen to it yourself and begin to connect with a song which has sections which will variously bore you, amaze you and often leave you in tears.The \"Age of Adz\" is album devoid of discipline, restraint or brevity. It is a smorgasbord of ideas some of which work brilliantly, others fail gallantly and a few never get out of the starting gate. Certainly this a very different proposition to the mix of orchestrated packed bravado combined with the wintry acoustics of \"Michigan\" and \"Illinois\". Yet if the masterful experimentation of both those albums left you gasping for more \"The Age of Adz\" should hold no fear for you for this is pop or rock music in its loosest sense. Last year Stevens wrote a Stravinsky inspired album dedicated to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and only two months ago he released an EP entitled \"All you delighted people\" which extended to well over an hour. Stevens is a composer packed with musical ideas some great, some claptrap, some challenging and some sublime. What is the truth is that there no one else out there working this distinctive seam in this manner. Thereby \"The Age of Adz\" is full testimony to Stevens uniqueness and it should be a cause of great celebration and rejoicing for this is not so much an album release as a musical event.\n", "val": 0.0025134182069450617}
{"text": "In 2009, Sufjan Stevens contributed a song called \"You Are the Blood\" to the excellent compilation album, Dark Was the Night.  At the time it was released, it was one of the first original Sufjan pieces I'd heard in years, and at 10 minutes, it seemed to signal a change in the style of music the artist was interested in creating.  It was not only the song's length that gave it away, but also the heavy emphasis on electronic instrumentation.  While the more dedicated fans out there know that electronic music is nothing new to Stevens, he had yet to really combine it with his more orchestral pieces in the way that he did in that song.  I, for one, found it to be a refreshing take on his usual schtick which, like it or not, just wouldn't have been as enchanting now as it was in 2005 (if only for the fact that we've all been listening to it for five years).  With The Age of Adz, Sufjan continues to evolve his sound in a similar manner to \"You Are the Blood,\" with almost-perfect results!The album begins with \"Futile Devices,\" a beautifully soft acoustic song that serves more as a palette cleanser than as a track indicative of the whole of Adz.  Sufjan's billowy vocals float lightly over his delicate guitar-picking, putting the listener at ease and giving us the chance to enjoy the wonderfully-written lyrics.  It ends abruptly, if not beautifully, running head on into the glitchy percussion of \"Too Much.\"  This song is the real primer for  The Age of Adz.  It adds synths and electronic percussion to great effect, but simultaneously retains what was always so great about Sufjan Stevens' music - namely, a brilliant composition, lively vocal arrangements, and music that is constantly engaging.  It literally sounds like a classic 50-states era song with some newly-introduced instruments.  It's easily one of the album's catchiest tracks, and the one on which most opinions will be hitched; positive or negative.From here, Sufjan continues to trek into new territory.  Title track, \"The Age of Adz\" begins with a flood of horns and flutes that make it sound more like the soundtrack to an epic battle scene than a Sufjan Stevens song.  Unfortunately, a lot of that momentum is thrown out soon after and the song reveals itself to be a bit more ho-hum than it led on - like a sheep in wolf's clothing.  \"The Age of Adz\" reveals pretty plainly what the album's greatest flaw is, and that is Stevens' reoccurring difficulty to write a compelling vocal melody.  The same guy who was able to make a song about a serial killer into a oddly-catchy sing-along can barely assemble a strong string of notes on a few of the songs on Adz.  Granted, on tracks like \"All For Myself\" or \"Bad Communication,\" he seems more focused on creating an atmosphere than a melody, but he does so at the expense of arguably one of his greatest talents as a songwriter.\"Get Real, Get Right\" picks up where \"Too Much\" left off, blending upbeat glitch percussion and more traditional instrumentation with a strong hook.  Surprisingly strong, in fact, considering it features Sufjan and Co. singing \"Do yourself a favor and get real, get right with the Lord.\"  Sufjan's never been one to shy away from his faith in music, but it's rarely been so plainly written and joyfully executed.  Whether it's done in jest or in earnest is debatable, but the brilliance of the song is not.  A person with a less open mind might be quick to judge then when Sufjan proudly declares just a few songs later that he's [..] - but I personally find it to be one of The Age of Adz's most-enjoyable moments!  The moment happens in the second half of \"I Want to Be Well.\"  On first listen, I was caught off guard by the sheer brazenness of the language.  Sufjan has always been a very delicate writer.  However, by the time he's passionately shouting the line over a chorus of vocals singing \"I want to be well,\" I'm right there with him, cheering him on!  This is not an emotion we are used to from this guy, and it is made all the more powerful as a result.A lot will probably be said about the way that Sufjan decided to end The Age of Adz.  Any song that clocks in at over 25 minutes is certainly a sign of overindulgence, and \"Impossible Soul\" is certainly not an exception to this rule.  But to its credit, the song never tires, never bores - not once in its 25 minutes!  Plus, the song gives us a featured performance from Annie Clark, a dance section, and one of the most tragic endings to a song I've heard all year.  Is it unnecessary?  It's hard to say, really.  To be sure, his use of auto-tune in one section is questionable (and perhaps unintentionally funny).  But at the same time, the technology has definitely been used to worse ends in the last few years!  And let's not forget that \"Impossible Soul\" is perhaps more accurately viewed as the second half to a double album or an EP within an LP.  Even without its inclusion on Adz, the album is brilliant, however its place at the end of the album gives The Age of Adz a more touching ending and an increased depth.  There is a lot to take in here that many of listeners may not appreciate until after repeated listens.Whether people end up hating or loving The Age of Adz, one can't really fault Sufjan for wanting to try his hand at self-reinvention.  In 2005, this guy was on top of the indie music world.  It would have been easy to milk that success with a few more albums about states in the same vein as his previous critically-acclaimed albums.  Instead, he retreated into pet projects and relative obscurity, all the while crafting an album that is bold, entirely unique, and unfailingly captivating!  The Age of Adz is refreshing in ways few albums have been since Illinois was released over half a decade(!) ago.  While it won't hold a candle to some of his past albums, The Age of Adz stands entirely on its own as a brilliant work of creative genius!  Sufjan is back, and thank god, he hasn't lost it!

My first purchase in his discography was his latest album \"Carrie and Lowell\", and I must say, his voice and music carry over really well to vinyl records.

Even from the first track, \"Futile Devices\", you can tell his voice is almost weak and frail, which accurately depicts his state of mind during the creation of this album. My personal favorite track is \"Vesuvius\" as it is VERY soothing. The title track, \"Age of Adz\", is ALL OVER THE PLACE.

{"text": "The Age of Adz is a fantastic album, showcasing Stevens' reinvention of his musical palette. Most people know him for his wistful, meticulous songwriting from his album Michigan and his most popular album Illinois. However, that's not all he's done as a musician. The oft-forgeten Enjoy Your Rabbit shows a different side of Sufjan, all glitch and mad rhythm. The Age of Adz is the offspring of his earlier tinkering in electronica. Banjos and hushed ballads are blasted away in drum loops and heavy brass. The same feverish attention to detail is present, with flute trills rolling wildly through the instrumentation and choral descants wavering over his digital beeps and squeals.The album uses the apocalyptic artwork of Royal Robertson (whose work is featured on the cover and vinyl sleeves) as a starting point. The album sets itself up as a hysterical dream, with melodrama, sickness, volcanoes, and death thrashing between two soft, acoustical pieces which bookend the beast. One of the most intense, emotive moments on the album crashes into you with Stevens wailing \"I'm not f******g around\" on the song I Want to be Well. Other attention worthy moments: he manages a electro-pop song in 7/4! He composes electronica/a capella! And of course, the back end of the album, his Impossible Soul, which weighs in at a broad 25 minutes. Although an intimidating length, he overfills it with more motifs, textures, and ideas than you'll find in many artist's whole albums (he even whips out autotune for a few bars!).The only issue I could find is not with the music of the album itself, but rather its format on vinyl. In order to fit Impossible Soul on Side D of the vinyl release, its very last section had to be moved around. The proper end is called Pleasure Principle, which you'll find earlier in the album. Still, I'm so happy to have it in a physical format.

{"text": "Sufjan Stevens is a mastermind when it comes to making music. Every time Sufjan makes a song you can tell it's him. His critically acclaimed album Illinois was known for the orchestral arrangement of melodies and adding layers of strings and trumpets, and all sorts of interments in it, while also having great poetic lyrics about history, culture and aliens. It would take Sufjan five years to come out with The Age of Adz album. He once said in an interview with pitchfork, \"I'm getting tired of my voice. I'm getting tired of ...the banjo. I'm getting tired of...the trumpet.\" He wanted something new, and he felt like he wasn't going anywhere creatively. He got inspired to make a new album when he helped his friend film a documentary on a Louisiana artist names Royal Robertson. Sufjan became inspired and found that he began writing lyrics based on the artist's visions and paintings, and Royal Robertson's personal life, and thoughts and views of the world. Around this time Sufjan became very ill. After helping his friend, Sufjan found himself being almost bed ridden and unable to make music. During this time, Sufjan really focused on life and death and living, and also remembered Royal Robertson's views on the world; consequently, you can hear on this album in his voice has some urgency he uses his voice in layers and gives himself a ghost-like feel, and you here in his lyrics the views of death ; for example, he writes a song about himself and uses his own name in the song called \"Vesuvius.\"Sufjan would later end up using Royal Robertson's artwork in the Age of Adz cover and inner sleeves. At first listen, you will find the opening track \"Futile Devices\" will have Sufjan with beautiful arrangements of acoustic guitar and piano playing that is soothing and a typical Sufjan Stevens sound while still having trumpets, horns, harps and a choir in the background, giving an opera feel to it which the rest of the album will consist of. Sufjan manages to give you layers and layers of sound and many tones in a track; as a result, you find yourself replaying the album, and trying to name what instruments and what sound you just heard.On the album title track `'The Age of Adz,\" you will hear instruments, but also you will hear what sounds like a car alarms and chants and find yourself in a circus type feel and have mixed melodies. Listen and you will find that he gives you imagery in his sound and organization of song form and lyrics. I found myself wondering what he is meaning, and the more I listened I started piecing it all together.Then I found out that Royal Robertson suffered from depression and went crazy after his wife left him and all he did after was make signs and write his thoughts of the future. It all starts to make sense that Sufjan used his life and mixes Royal Robertson's life and combines them and writes lyrics that will fit him and Royal Robertson, and bring the listener into this world which makes you as a listener feel like you are let into ones person's life, and you go through this roller coaster of a story with him.I will admit at first listen I wasn't sure what to think of this album. I found myself at a record store, and I Loved the album art of the Vinyl LP and bought it because I knew of Sufjan's previous work, and I liked a couple of tracks from his last album Illinois.It came with an mp3 download card which allowed me to download the entire album. I put it on my mp3 player, and I began to listen to to. At first listen, I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't until I put the vinyl LP on my turntable that I realized how amazing this album is. The instruments' sounds have room to breathe on vinyl, letting you hear how detailed and beautiful this album is.Sufjan Stevens goes for a big dynamic sound which you will hear in The Age of Adz. You will find his writing style is more of love and loss and more about Sufjan himself, which is a first for him, but also he has this end of the world theme coming from Royal Robertson's thoughts about the future and of dooms day artwork he always painted. The last and final track of Sufjan Stevens' Age of Adz is a twenty five minute track called \"Impossible Soul.\"This is my favorite on this record. It tells a whole story in itself and keeps you engaged until the end. It leads you into a story about a man and his mind set after a girl leaves him, then switched to a different point of view, then goes back to the man's mind, then goes to the woman's' mind, then you are left with something beautiful.If you are a fan of music and like to listen to albums as a whole, I think that you will find much depth in this album that you might not get it on the first listen. But when you give it a little more listening to, you will find something that is truly a masterpiece.\n", "val": 0.00014676802675239742}

The ones not listed I didn't like either because it was too repetitive or sounded like noise, which makes \"Too Much\" and \"Impossible Soul\" an exception because they have repetitive lyrics and some parts that might sound like noise, but its saving grace is the fact that it hypnotizes me; it sounds cool!

{"text": "So I bought myself a pair of Sennheiser headphones and amp the other week, and while I was scouring my itunes library for some ear candy to compliment my new setup, I came across Age Of Adz.In a library of 1000's of albums, Age Of Adz instantly stood out on my headphones. Up there with Flaming Lips' Yoshimi album or something from Of Montreal. There is no denying the layers of production here. This album is extremely textural.Its interesting to see what Sufjan Stevens has chosen to do here, he has left behind simple melodic song writing that made Illinoise so well received and instead concentrates on the textural techniques he used to make Illinoise so orchestral and expansive. The title track is so aggressively multi-dimensional to the point I feel like Im sitting for an 'Avatar' equivalent audio extravaganza. I cant imagine how poorly channelled this would sound on a pair of ordinary 2 piece speakers. It would be the equivalent of taking your glasses off at a 3d screening.But it is on my headphones that Ive started to really get hooked on some of these 3 dimensional layers of melody. I cant explain it, but all I can say is that it is a stark difference to the way I enjoyed the simple melodies of Illinoise.Age of Adz is Sufjan Stevens living up this name of being an incredible composer.- \"Is this the future from outer space\"\n", "val": 0.0003736445214599371}

There is very little here that sounds like the Sufjan Stevens we have come to love, and contrary to what some folks will tell you, being \"different\" and confounding your listeners' expectations is not ALWAYS a good thing.  I'd like to refer those who claim that Sufjan is just trying to get us out of our limited idea of what he should do with this half-baked, underwritten, over-effected, largely-electronic mish-mash to listen to, I don't know, Neil Young's \"Trans\" for proof that \"different\" or \"shaking things up\" is not an automatic pass for an established artist.  I have a very hard time with this record, I'll admit.  Listened to it twice so far.

While Bjrk's album has a strong industrial/electronic sound, Stevens' is more ethereal/futuristic/epic. In addition, Bjrk's album sounds from the 90's; Stevens' album definitely features a \"new era of music\" sound. I admit that this is one of those hate-it or love-it albums.

{"text": "I was not initially convinced by this new direction and at first agreed with what others have described as a \"self-indulgent\" album. However, upon repeated listening and having just seen him live, I'm compelled to say that this is definitely a five star album and that Sufjan Stevens is an incredible musician, performer and persona.The problem with a lot of reviews here is that they reveal how expectation coupled with personal taste combine to make people unnecessarily derisive: If you love contemporary folk music and loved his other albums ('Enjoy Your Rabbit' an obvious exception, but a real indication that 'The Age of Adz' was always on the cards) then this album will no doubt disappoint you and you should avoid it. So unfortunately a lot of the negative reviews are from self-described fans who have blindly bought this album expecting lilting folk songs and then found something far too avant-garde for their taste!However, if you are into a broad range of music (and do like multi-layered electronica) then definitely give this album a listen. There is a mix of funk, dance and electro-pop coupled with Sufjan's patented folk singing (and orchestral highs and lows) that make it quite unique. And that's what makes this such a long-term album: there is a lot that unfolds over many listens... so not an easy quick-fix, lovely-listen like his previous albums. You'll need to give it time if you are prepared to follow his move toward what I now think is an exciting direction.I would say this is similar to Radiohead putting out 'Kid A' and losing all their so-called 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer' fans. People who were never really open-minded enough to understand that what makes these musicians so good is their desire to progress and experiment rather than churn out the same old, same old. They require their audience to be a little more adventurous and to listen and understand a more broad range of music as they themselves do.IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO SEE THIS ALBUM PERFORMED LIVE IT WILL MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE!

Please let me know if there is, so  I can then buy their albums and stop playing this one out. Please and Thanks.If you can listen to the depth in Sufjan's music, the intricacies in his orchestration, his brilliant lyrics & vocal arrangements and not be touched, then I'm just not sure your musical awareness is well developed....Sure, there are many many talented musical artists, but those artists generally follow a formula that works for them and their sound-albeit amazing-is marginal. Said artists may evolve from album to album, but I have never seen a complete rebirth as evidenced by Sufjan in The Age of Adz. Let me also say that I ADORE his classics Illinoise, Seven Swans, & Michigan. I have been entranced by those albums, they touch me very deeply on an emotional level. However, the Age of Adz is probably his best album because it is able to encompass all that Sufjan is capable of. Sort of like a culmination of all of his musical experiments that have somehow been transmuted into a radically new sound. There are new emotions, new ideas and yet you still feel the safety and purity of the old Sufjan.There are mixed opinions on Sufjans choice to go electronic. Personally I was stoked when I found out, never doubting that this project was going to be spectacular. Calm down folk lovers, and respect the fact that we're dealing with a prodigy. How many instruments does he play? Was it 20?..... Let him evolve. Let that genius mind continue on it's journey and be grateful that we get to partake in it. Listening to The Age of Adz is a soaring cerebral adventure. It is all at once spiritual, haunting, ecstatic, romantic, profound....as far as this album is concerned, I think Sufjan says it best, \"words are futile devices.\"The album is a grower, and that is simply because it is designed that way. It is so complex and so well done that it cannot be grasped in a single listen. Savor it!!My favourite songs in no particualar order:1) Futile Devices- (this song made me realize I loved someone.

Phenonemal track.The Age Of Adz: Big Booming Intro with dramatic backing vocals give way to more multi layered beats, follow on trumpets, electronic baselines and choirs. Settles down at the end. The music probes and swells and comes to rest and is admittedly very good although there is something very uneasy and edgy about it throughout. Another total winner.I Walked: great vocals here by Sufjan with personal break up type lyrics. more of a relaxed poppy style here. - sounds a bit 1980's - really greatNow That Im Older: oos and aahs just at the right time - singer can look at love differently now he's older - absolutely gorgeous - wonderful trackGet Real Get Right: 'With the Lord' - Tuneful. a decent track in the context of the Royal Robertson theme. Prophets. A spaceship is mentioned - as is outer space. Not quite as good as the others so farBad Communication: Sufjan slows down - sufjan resolves conflict with ray guns rather than talking things through in an adult fashionVesuvius: a very strange track - not my fave but heyAll For Myself: The album picks up a bit again here. The electronica does not distract but rather enhances - decent cut.I Want To Be Well: Sensational Track. Deeply emotional lyrics about someone struggling with illness and i think the most successful blend of electronic bleeps, traditional instruments, backing vocals and lyrics, tune, the lot and the type of thing sufjan was striving for on this record. Not one for children's parties.

Well, I decided to find out what the fuss is all about by listening to The Age of Adz. Boy, I was blown off and completely overwhelmed by Stevens. My first thought was was that he kinda sounded like a younger Damien Rice but I could not be more wrong. Sufjan Stevens is a genius and The Age of Adz is possibly the year's must-listen album. The musical styles are varied, his voice impassioned to no end and the songs are impeccably stirring.There's never a dull moment and each composition is layered - a great mix of rock, folk, electronic and pop but none threatens to create disharmony. Instead, it's a pretty delightful amalgamation.  And Steven's lyrics are certainly most insightful and personal. Choice tracks include  Now that I'm Older, I Walk, Futile Devices, Too Much and of course, the 25-minute epic Impossible Soul. No one would imagine sitting through a song of such great length but what Sufjan Stevens has created on Impossible Soul, some artists could never muster in their entire career. The song itself is distinctive and unique, thematically running but wrapped in a myriad of styles and  melodies. While most monster-length compositions suffer from some form of disjoint, Impossible Soul works on all levels. Imagine my joy at the end of each day now is to put Impossible Soul on play and slowly savour it. Now, I call it The Age of Great!

{"text": "It's hard to write a decent review for one of the most shining, innovative albums of the year. That being said, I've been tentatively been putting this review on the back burner. Before I begin, I have to tell you I wasn't much of a Sufjan fan before. His voice was soft spoken and songs felt a little too childish and unrelatable for my alternative rock tastes. But Sufjan's new album, entitled \"Age of Adz,\" blew my preconceived notions out of the water and left me gasping on the beach. Not only has Sufjan reinvented his song writing, he has managed to do so with utter  ingenuity  and brilliance. I've heard comparisons to Radiohead's \"Kid A,\" but it's more of a step-brother to \"Hail to the Thief,\" albeit better. Many of Age of Adz mirrors paintings of a schizophrenic artist and his own battle with a immune disease.The intro Futile Devices is more of a farewell to elegance of the past. \"Too Much\" sets the mood right, to the seemingly eclectic and bizarreness of the album. Age of Adz seems like a brilliant summary from the album as a whole,  beginning like a monstrous nightmare at a circus, to beautiful guitar strings at the end. \"I Walked\" is probably the black sheep of all the songs, repetitive and mundane.  What is most notable about Sufjan's singing and his lyrics is that they are the most poignantly honest and emotional in his career. Songs like \"Now That I'm Older,\" laments past mistakes and \"All for Myself\" is starkly introspective. \"Vesuvius\" explores the darkest crevices of human nature and Sufjan's increasing desperation. And my favorite song, \"I Want To Be Well\" pushes the listener to borderline insanity-- sweet, insane, pandemonium of a mind that isn't \"f-ing around.\" And who can forget the 25 minute song that is a bit self-indulging, but worth an admirable ending. Somehow Sufjan has able to craft an ingeniously dark, hopeful, deep, and intimately album that demands careful and repetitive listening. The album sure isn't easy listening, nor \"radio friendly,\" but like a fine wine it'll require aging. You'll be hooked.\n", "val": 0.013913646340370178}
{"text": "Sufjan has returned from some sort of cosmic delirium (vast experimentation with electronic soundscapes, researching Royal Robertson's artwork and life, and battling illness) and has brought an amazing development.First, I'll start off with what Sufjan fans will find familiar:  the sweeping arppegiated phrases on the woodwinds, Sufjan's great lyricism and vocal licks, and great narrative in each song.  When I first heard Age of Adz, I thought of \"Star of Wonder\".  The title track feels very similar.What's new:  Though he's delved into it before, the electronic palette here sounds very warm.  Sounds paradoxical but the production on this album feels analogue especially when the electronics are alongside acoustic instruments like the woodwinds.  Overall, I'd say the palette feels somewhere from the world of IDM and glitch but it's tastefully used imo.  Not much acoustic guitar or banjo to be found hereAs mentioned before, the lyrics do form an overarching concept that feels biblical at times.  This makes sense given the thematic elements on this album such as aspects of Royal Robertson's work (his artwork is on the cover and in the booklet btw).  However, there are surely numerous separate, influential themes at play but that one is the most apparent.  The theme of the album is really the major difference I think from past albums.  Some might call it less personal than his passed albums but it's my opinion that this album is more personal than his others.  It's a demonstration of Sufjan working through a creative crisis of sorts and it really comes across as an exposed, vulnerable work demonstrating his struggle.All the tracks are really amazing and I didn't feel there was any filler here.  \"Impossible Soul\" is really amazing in particular.  The title track got me hooked, \"I Want To Be Well\" could be his edgiest song yet, and \"Too Much\" is a great pop-ish hit in 7/8.I'm not sure if anyone could've seen Age of Adz coming, but given his work with The BQE and folk record, I suppose it's possible.

{"text": "Sufjan Stevens' musical career has been like a rolling stone that has in fact gathered quite a lot of moss - acoustic folk, indie pop, orchestral arrangements, electronica, and much more. And each addition has been transmuted through his highly idiosyncratic view of the world. 'The Age of Adz' feels like the culmination of his musical and personal evolution since the success of 'Illinoise'. This album is crammed full of musical flourishes and experimentation, all in the service of a tortured, sublime and heart-rending emotional narrative. The songs are remarkably deep and addictive, worming their way into your head and echoing around for days. As I write this the chorus to 'All For Myself' is playing itself in my mind. This is one for the ages.\n", "val": 0.04510794207453728}

This is one of the more enjoyable and thought-provoking albums I have bought this year.  There are albums to compare it to, but this is not the sort of music one would call \"accessible.\"  In many ways, those who will have the hardest time appreciating this music are the more ardent fans of Sufjan Steven's previous albums.I shudder to classify this as experimental music in the indie rock vein, because here you have a clear concept where many experimental albums are searching for one.  This is an album that requires patient listening and multiple plays, yet that alone won't be enough for people stuck on the more accessible prior Sufjan Stevens albums.  This album is neither better nor is it worse than those albums.  It is simply different, and it stands on its own very well.IMPOSSIBLE SOUL AND OUT OF PLACE TRACKSIt is tempting to critically dissect these tracks.  Some tracks, like \"I Want To Be Well,\" seem better designed to be played live.  Others are just so unconventional that they seem out of place here.  But all of them are good in their own way.\"Impossible Soul\" provides a perfect example.  It's really an EP on its own.  It brings to mind groups like Phoenix, MGMT, and Passion Pit.  This track is less of a song and more like a mash-up of 7 or 8 diverse songs.  There's even an auto-tuned section around the 11 minute mark that is indicative of its range.  It would be normal to think these various elements to be scattered, but careful repeated listens reveal its satirical beauty.There are more *pop* elements buried within this track than on the rest of the album.  But because they are not accompanied by much lyrically, they take some work to fully appreciate.  I don't mind getting two albums for the price of one.  Unfortunately, the lyrical repetition and track length may be off-putting to some.START HEREThose on the fence should explore the following tracks first.  They may be more accessible, with vocals that are more forward versus the instrumentation that takes a front seat on so many other tracks.The first track, \"Futile Devices,\" is reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkul's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bridge-Over-Troubled-Water/dp/B00005NKKZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bridge Over Troubled Water</a>.  Sparse piano and guitar accompaniment give the harmonized vocals a dream-like quality. \"Now That I'm Older\" is a track that evokes the mood of songs like Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb.\"  The beginning brings to mind angelic choral chamber music, but the instrumentation comes in waves over the early and middle portions before giving way to the vocals again.  This pulsating instrumentation is used in other songs too, like \"All For Myself.\"\"I Walked\" is perhaps my favorite track.  The moderate vocal reverb and familiar theme of romantic longing makes it easy to relate to.  The instrumentation alternates between mid-tempo rock and keyboard infused chamber music.\"Vesuvius\" is just a beautiful song.  I am reminded of the most recent album from Imogen Heap,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ellipse/dp/B0028Y5MY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ellipse</a>.  \"Too Much\" also brings that album to mind both in the vocals and the instrumentation.CONCLUSIONThis is an album that may grow on you if you are patient.  It will be most readily appreciated by fans of the experimental and layered instrumentation.  It fits in nicely in the alternative and indie categories.  While it may have an uphill battle on the independent radio circuit, most music nerds and seekers of new music should find something of interest here.Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.011161264963448048}

{"text": "Wow, I just can't describe how much I love this album.  But I'll try. This is like a perfect blend of the Sufjan we have come to love (you can hear some self-referencing hooks), but with an awesome twist that reminds me of so many different cool influences: Of Montreal, Beulah, Olivia Tremor Control, Thom Yorke/Radiohead (how much does he sound like Thom Yorke at ~3:45 into I Want To Be Well!?)... It has a sort of a Flaming Lips thing going too with all the blips and bleeps and the general epic-ness.  I wouldn't even consider it a \"grower\" since I was totally hooked at first listen, and I have been listening to it on loop since getting it. I guess it could be a grower, since I feel slightly more obsessive weeks later. Either way, I guess that is all a matter of what you want from your music.  This album is absolutely worth your attention if you are open minded to an artist evolving/trying new things!\n", "val": 0.062110718339681625}

Now we're treated to \"songs\" of greater length and diversity.  Fans of Michigan and Illinoise may be disappointed by this album at first, but give it a chance.  I think it's every bit as good as his previous efforts, and the accomplishment of The Age of Adz shows that Sufjan Stevens may well be the leading voice in independent music today.\n", "val": 0.016109034419059753}

Upon first listen I thought there were a couple really good songs on Age of Adz, while the rest was mostly okay, but not quite polished material. I've been listening to the album for a few weeks now and I've grown to really enjoy it. I had the great fortune of attending a Sufjan Stevens concert last week, and it really helped make the CD click. Watching the band perform these pieces live gives you a real respect and understanding of the seemingly initial chaos of some of the songs.

{"text": "First things first.  Sufjan Stevens is not just a writer of pretty ballads.  If you took \"A Sun Came\" and mixed it with that first Rabbit album, this is pretty much what you would get.  And seriously, listen to the song \"Seven Swans.\"  Don't get me wrong, I love a pretty Sufjan ballad but A) Those pretty ballads say some incredibly uncomfortable things and B) Sometimes pretty ballads don't accomplish your objective.  Besides, the dude needs some room to evolve.I get where the bad reviews are coming from.  The first time I listened to \"The Age of Adz\" I had a total Stravinsky moment...massive anxiety, heart palpitations, the whole nine yards.  And then when we got to all that phunking around in \"I want to be well,\" I thought he'd totally jumped the shark. (BTW, It's not an endless loop of f-bombs, but the old F does show up at a pivotal and easily discerned moment.)  It's hard to get to the heart of the thing when you have to wade through the endless waves of electronic pulsing and crazy shouting people, especially when the only lyrics you can discern sound like they were written by an angry 12 year old.  But you gotta get through the layers.  You have to see the album in its crazy, schizophrenic entirety.  It is an uncomfortable space-journey, super-dark and difficult, but at its heart this album is the brilliant and intensely self-critical work of a mind uncomfortable with what it sees within.So the best thing I can say is that you have to listen to this one with an open and deliberate mind.  Check out Royal Robertson's artwork...the music makes a lot more sense once you've seen it.  And if it doesn't click for you, that's fine.  It's not for everyone and it shouldn't have to be.\n", "val": 0.01110877376049757}
{"text": "He's taken us through the States of Michigan and Illinois - studiously, charmingly, unflagging graciousness all the way - and now Sufjan Stevens has radically revised the itinerary for an unforeseen intergalactic launch to uncharted destinations, to a place that might just have to be called \"The State of My Heart\".  And it's a territory at least as expansive as the imagined Universe, apparently.A long track-by-track appreciation follows, but here's the bottom line:  THE AGE OF ADZ is a concept album that takes as its subject the human experience of that one greatest thing that remains:  Love.  Awkward enough to type that out here as an anonymous reviewer, but Sufjan Stevens the artist has gone and built a veritable public monument of an album around it, on it, with it, from it, to it, for it.And he really has done it proper, inside and out, backwards and forwards, with his heart hanging out.From inner space of the Soul to outer space of the Cosmos, this album is an aural and conceptual collision of scale worthy of the task that it meets head-on.  And it's crafted and sequenced with more discipline and unfaltering intuition than might be apparent from cursory and piecemeal assessments.  For the commission that it has taken on (Cher auto-tunes it to you from the year 1998: \"Do you belieeeve in life after love?\"), this record arrives whole, a clear dispatch from some very far-flung outposts.So here we go, a Lonely Planet overview of the trip I took on THE AGE OF ADZ:\"FUTILE DEVICES\" is, for a melodist and lyricist of Sufjan's gifts and abilities, essentially a throwaway, and definitely a throwback.  As opening track, though, it's in the right place as a kind of dedication and epigram:  scrapbook mementos of friendship & intimacy, scrawled memories of warmth, tucked away in a safe place, close to the body, before launching off into deep-freeze outer limits.And a beleaguered lyricist's frank admission, right up front:  \"words are futile devices\".\"TOO MUCH\" opens the concept album proper with synthesizer squelches like a baptism of primordial slime.  Something's definitely changing, mutation looks to be inevitable - but it's impossible to assess or prevent damage while sloshing around in this predicament.  So this track, along with the two that follow, thematically and collectively sound like valiant Boy Scout attempts at speedy extrication and escape.  Both the smartest and the dumbest move, and all perfectly necessary, perhaps, at this emotional juncture.\"TOO MUCH\" plays like a State of the Union address on Love's falling out, growing progressively tenser and more serious as it proceeds.  The war is definitely on and we're being forced to take it into outer space - plans and coordinates are on the screen for your review.But all such formalities and strategies are prematurely and effectively blasted to Kingdom Come when the next track, \"AGE OF ADZ\", sneaks into the control room on four computer beeps and just pushes the button:  a bombastic Apocalypse of Love's recriminations, existential panic escalating into too-hasty grasping at always-imminent Transcendence, ending only with more mournful explanations and self-recriminations - alone with a banjo, crouched, maybe, in a bomb shelter.  And if that sounds like a real pretentious and overloaded assessment, it's more or less what this track merits.  Overblown and precarious, it also makes perfect conceptual and emotional sense in its place and context.With such grand and necessary meltdowns out of the way (for the time being), \"I WALKED\" is the track that soberly straightens itself out in the mirror and gets ready for its ostensible swan song.  A heartrending and dignified farewell performance, attractive in the measured sadness of its earnest grievances, this is the point at which most well-meaning friends would administer warm hugs and admiring pats on the back, fire off text message salutes, all in praise of emotional maturity, courage and honesty, and what else have you.And at this stage, a still-aching, heart-wounded soul would be dazed and weakened enough to really want to believe all that.And it is also from here on that THE AGE OF ADZ, to these critical ears, starts to become really interesting and involving.  The early stages of network consultation and public demonstration done, whoever now pushes on, pushes on alone, by dint of sheer emotional fortitude and crack intuition.In terms of songwriting craft and production polish, the next track, \"NOW THAT I'M OLDER\", along with \"BAD COMMUNICATION\", is one of the few obvious bummers on the album.  Titled as a coming-of-age number, it seems to convey that process as a kind of slow spiritual diffusion into the ether, a really depressed and melodramatic emotional wallow, in other words.These two lesser tracks, however, appropriately represent the emotional nadirs of the album's song-cycle, and they serve their purpose well in repetitious and desultory melodies, prosaic and scattershot lyrics, dragging tempos and haphazard production.  Thematically, they sound like the sad diminishing returns of long shut-in days.  And also significantly, they come on either end of what is arguably the album's masterpiece, track six, \"GET REAL GET RIGHT\".There's that old religious adage about the Almighty being near to those poor and lowly in spirit, and on the fantastic \"GET REAL GET RIGHT\" - which opens with fat beats overlaid with the sound of syncopated human hiccups, like someone finally regaining his breath after a bout of terrible weeping - it's as if the drawn-out days of an aimless depression have been graciously interrupted by decree of some truly divine intervention.  In sudden wakefulness, certain veils are lifted, all the necessary lenses float and align in place, and like that old Television song says, \"My eyes are like telescopes\".The lyrics risk preachy grandstanding in their telegraphic prophesying, but \"GET REAL GET RIGHT\" powers past such pitfalls by the heat of genuine moral conviction, the press of personal culpability.  The performance here is totally committed, the production bang-on, and incredibly enough, the whole thing seems to accomplish exactly what it set out to do, something like a heat-seeking missile compared to the mistimed A-bomb of \"AGE OF ADZ\" a few tracks earlier.  The synthesizers at the thunderous climax are excellently deployed, mixed to maximum effectiveness, like heavenly mecha robots wreaking righteous havoc across morally torpid metropolises the world over.All in all, this track is just unimpeachable, the moral and spiritual centre of an album whose concept could not have held so strongly without this kind of lightning rod of conviction.But then, because no mortal can indefinitely sustain himself at such levels of blazing prophetic inspiration, there comes the severe and necessary comedown of \"BAD COMMUNICATION\", with opening synths like platypus farts and lyrics aptly demonstrating the relational breakdown of its title:  one-sided conversations with a person suddenly a stranger, sharing no such moral or spiritual compunctions, middle-of-the-night convictions breaking down in the bleak light of the workaday rush.And so, on \"VESUVIUS\", the fledgling prophet's mantle is set aside for the recovery of that more familiar calling - artist & composer - and Sufjan Stevens slowly rouses himself through a kind of musical pep talk, one that also seems to have been conceived as a dirge for his own funeral.  He's rather dragging his feet to the task that still lies ahead.  Because any prophet or artist worth his salt knows that the expressed truth he aims for - prophetic, artistic, or otherwise - will effectively injure his own self before landing with any clarity or conviction in the ears and hearts of his listeners.  And then, hopefully, the healing reply of vindication, redemption.Sample lyric:  \"Why does it have to be so hard?\"The next two tracks, \"ALL FOR MYSELF\" and \"I WANT TO BE WELL\", close out the album's first long section (before the 25-minute suite that is \"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\") and they also introduce a level of carnality and profanity not previously encountered in the Sufjan Stevens catalogue.  The artist here is digging deep, into genuinely subconscious grounds as well as those intentionally obscured, and the results are appropriately discomfiting, upsetting and stirring.  If, someday, someone, in the eggheaded spirit of this long album review, should undertake a book-length critical study entitled \"Sufjan's Vision of Sin\", these two tracks will be the early go-to texts.  They signal the kind of wholly unexpected but then entirely coherent artistic development that harks back and links up to previous works while marking a decisive departure from and qualification of same.So if that very lovely, lyrical yarn about predatory wasps and best boyhood friends from Illinois days was something like Sufjan's \"We Two Boys Together Clinging\", \"ALL FOR MYSELF\" here sounds like a dark thematic extraction from \"Calamus\", that cycle of poems wherein good gray Walt Whitman knits his brow and broods that \"an athlete is enamoured of me - and I of him\", but \"toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me, eligible to burst forth\".  Hairy chests replace youthful limbs wet from the swim, and the whole song is frankly orgasmic in conception and execution, all shuddering starts and stops and shifting rhythms before another ride on the cresting, crashing crescendos of the chorus proper.(\"All For Myself\":  about as succinct and forthright a motto as any about the need, sometimes, to just get there.  And, as with Whitman, it isn't entirely clear if the \"there\" of this sensual and ritualized camaraderie entails actual physical consummation, or some other kind of metaphysical transportation vivid and gripping enough to boggle and confuse the flesh into chaste credulity.  For the always disciplined but constantly ravenous soul of the lifelong artist, fixedly attuned to the quality of rarefied experience, probably a prudent but potent mix of both, with an unmistakable tip toward the latter.)As for the bouncy and manic and altogether traumatic \"I WANT TO BE WELL\", let us now think back for a moment to Michigan days, to the shimmering, reverent tones of \"O GOD, WHERE ARE YOU NOW?\", with Sufjan pondering the resurrection of the dead and earnestly wondering, \"Would my body stay the same?\"  And so now, in this new song, thrashing madly against the living-nightmare effects of \"the pill or demon / As my body changes\", it really seems as good a time as any to break out the serious profanity, if only to let the oppressor know that this is one body that won't be going down without a fight.This track speaks of irreparably altered hopes and dreams, terrible abuses and betrayals of trust, and the desperate, too-late realization that mind & body & heart & soul are of a single human piece, and that to lose or forfeit even one of these to theft or treachery is to somehow become bereft of it all, both temporarily and permanently, in differing ways.Who's to say how far Sufjan Stevens has had to go to such places personally and actually?  But as an artist and writer of songs, at the very least, this track demonstrates that Sufjan Stevens has arrived at a place where he is able to both explicitly and elliptically convey a more sprawling and visceral kind of human empathy than when he was crafting sensitive if shrewdly appointed narratives about desolate middle-aged citizens who drive busted-up snowmobiles and shop at the K-Mart.  That particular difference, from this vantage point, seems like the difference between a gifted literary man and a real brotherly witness.As far as track sequencing goes, this album is going to work really well on double LP, potentially an even more interactively emotional experience on turntable than on CD or MP3.  Because after the rave-up and freak-out of \"I WANT TO BE WELL\", a moment's pause and quiet reflection would only serve to heighten the plangent gorgeousness of the opening minutes of \"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\", the long and varied track that waits on the other side of the vinyl.Opening with tentative, evenly paced keyboard tones, the song starts out like someone getting back up on shaky legs, taking deliberate but cautious steps toward recovered mobility.  And while I've usually demurred from fawning critics' talk about Sufjan's \"gorgeous vocals\" and especially his \"delicate falsetto\", what Sufjan the singer does here in the opening section of \"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\" is touched, I think, by something like technical and spiritual transcendence, word and performance pouring out together like the very marrow of a human soul.  The only dramatic equivalent I can pull up, really, is Gena Rowlands in the movie A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE, coming home to loved ones after the breakdown that saw her signed off to a long stay at the institution.Open your heart and mind; lend even a little bit of your imagination, emotion and free-association to the opening minutes of this track (and to every minute that comes after, for that matter), and your experience and understanding of THE AGE OF ADZ might well be transformed for you right there.  This is the sound of Love being calmly and confidently affirmed even in the passing of its accustomed realities, with the hard-earned knowledge that Love really is that one thing that can only be defended by an absolute lack of defenses.And when that first distorted guitar/synth break kicks in, like an injured mecha robot trying hard to juice it for just one last mission, with an attendant chorus of sympathetic angels blessing the effort even as they gently relieve it of a wasting struggle, the whole thing doesn't just soar on a musical level, it also attains a kind of thematic resplendence that hovers and spreads out over the album's concept as a whole.  It's not just the most beautifully realized moment of THE AGE OF ADZ but perhaps of Sufjan Stevens' entire oeuvre to date.  And, really, for all that has gone before in this album, that's exactly how it should work:  a real artistic coup in the want of other needful forms of justice, a rare-enough consolation against the failures of just plain old human decency.The remaining twenty-some minutes of \"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\" are largely successful, canny and affecting, and again, thematically coherent.  But the theme and concept here is the life that indeed goes on after Love's practical passing, with resultant words and music that are appropriately randomized and restless.  The Christian writer Oswald Chambers defines Love as \"the outpouring of one personality in fellowship with another personality\" (an explanation that might resound with particular profundity and poignancy only to those actually caught in the immediate thralls or throes of either finding or losing Love), and in the thematic absence and severance of such tender loving fellowship between human personalities joined in coupled mutuality, the latter sections of \"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\" play out like an eclectic soundtrack to the far-flung wanderings of a modern solitary soul, subsisting on a largely indiscriminate diet of mass media information, pop culture reference, and an infinitely expanding catalogue of endlessly reproduced art and entertainment, all remotely accessed and never not available.  Maybe that's stretching it a bit, but in more mundane terms, something like a newly single person passively working through self-intuited psychotherapy while clicking through the 5,000 channels of digital satellite television.And so even after the assaultive optimism of a hyped-up and truly infectious group dance number (industrious amateurs the internet over are currently editing down the perfect five-minute track for their next humanist masterpiece of mass cooperation and collective giddiness), the sinister carnival synths and haunted house strings kick in and take over, and, at the risk of too much outrageousness, the slowed-down vocal track here may or may not be that large man beckoning from the doorway, standing there in his clown suit, insisting, \"Boy, we can do much more together...\"  Those are the bad places the mind goes, maybe, when it skips on sleep and opts for stupefaction, absorbing true-crime TV in the middle of the night.  The whole thing runs close to ending with a droning in the ears - like the sound of a depleted human conscience that has, indeed, allowed itself to be distracted.The epilogue tune cuts in right at the end, and it's a very pretty composition, though pointedly chilly in performance and with lyrics that potentially upset and reverse whole sections of that which came before.  Are these words and sentiments being presented detachedly, as Exhibit A extractions from a \"Dear Sufjan\" letter?  Or is the songwriter here faking some kind of unthinkable Borgesian narrative trick, he himself having been the primary scoundrel and heartbreaker all along?  Flip-flopping gender nouns will be keeping fangirls and fanboys squirrelly and guessing for some time yet.Man or woman, boy or girl, friend or lover.  And in any case, this closing performance projects hard and cold on the memory of that one someone who went out leaving the impression of a Sphinx - a gaze as blank and pitiless as the sun - and the artist here, now truly older in many ways, elects to bow out, at the end of this long commission, emulating same.Hats and caps off, kids.  Sufjan Stevens has really done it, with what looks to have taken planet-sized determination and commitment, returning with what might be, as a unified work of singular personal vision, a career-best to date.I didn't even consider how the Royal Robertson stuff might tie in with all this, and don't really plan to any time soon (aren't you glad and relieved?), but it's pretty obvious that this album has been much more than a \"love & theft\" kind of deal.  Concept or no concept, the premise and proposal are plain:  Sometimes you just have to make it personal, make it inevitable, no regrets, no looking back.  And no matter what else, whatever sights & whatever sounds:  Keep your heart & soul with you, all the way through, even after the end, dear Special Friend.And did I really have to go and post this entire ordeal here, taxing everyone's browser space, just inviting internet ire?  As an oversized counterpoint to some pretty curt dismissals also to be found around these here parts, yes.  For the ephemeral enjoyment of mouse-scrolling over a five-star rating, also yes.  And now, at the end, again yes, for the more substantial pleasure of concluding this honestly unforeseen writing, getting this truly uncanny record out of my system for a while, and to reiterate once more:  Five Stars, Sufjan Stevens.  Five Stars, and for an album like this, hitting a lot of us upside the heart and head, getting some of us back up on quicker, more nimble feet, for delivering it on this side of the new decade, Five Big Stars and the Moon as well.Be well, musical friends!\n", "val": 0.01156306266784668}

{"text": "Sufjan Stevens is a lonely guy. Whether or not he bares it with sparse strings or buries it in a sea of choral and orchestral melodies, his sense of isolation saturates his music.Most would not think of Sufjan as a troubled soul; his bright, cheery music on \"Illinois\" painted him as more of a bandleader of an indie private school than any brooding artist. However, despite the innocuous tone, the lyrics dealt with unanswered prayer, sickness, serial killers, and the darkness that lurks within each of our hearts: in essence, using the guise of state trivia as a platform to discuss deeper issues.\"The Age of Adz\" has no quirky disguise of levity.'Adz is an exploration into loneliness, insecurity, bitterness, and unabashed love. The opening track \"Futile Devices\" washes over the listener in melodious melancholy. It's simplicity is one platter on which the tone of the album is served; the next two (\"Too Much\" and the title track) betray an entirely different one. It resorts to the tactic used in \"Illinois,\" in which Sufjan nearly overwhelms a simple melody with a complex wall of precise instrumentation. I won't go over each track; they mostly utilize these two different platters, often in the same song: a sound of intimidating instrumental and choral bigness, and one of stripped down humility. The title track and final, 25 minute epic (which does keep one's interest) both begin with a bang that nearly covers Sufjan's vocal melody, but each end with only him and a banjo; the melody that once seemed translucent rings clearly with lyrics like \"I'm sorry if I seem self-effacing, consumed by selfish thoughts. It's only that I still love you deeply. It's all the love I've got...\"However, Sufjan uses a much less organic sound than the friendly instruments in \"Illinois,\" trading swirling woodwinds for blaring tech effects. The sound is a colder, more cutting platform for his cold, cutting lyrics. Sufjan blurs and swiggles his voice in autotune during one movement of the epic. Yet, he uses it masterfully as a tool to express his lonely dehumanization. Thus, he knows exactly what he is doing: his experimentation is utterly precise.Despite the initially cold techy sound, this album seemed to resonate deeply with me.

{"text": "I have just listened to The Age of Adz (pronounced `crappy songwriting').  All I can say is I can't believe that this is what you get after 5 years. This album is appalling. Have you ever listened to new music by an artist you have always liked and thought to yourself, \"Wow. This sucks. They tried waaaay too hard\" That is my reaction.I firmly believe that anyone who says they honestly \"love\" this album is merely in love with their own solipsistic notions of Mr. Stevens. There is nothing wrong with electronic or experimental music. The problem is that there is no feeling in this new album when his previous material was full of feeling and all of the sounds here feel clumped together rather than working together. Something is very wrong. A burned out hipster from Austin could do this. At least I only paid $3.99 for it (though I still want it back).\"Futile Devices\" and \"Vesuvius\" are about the only decent things about this album (and select fragments of \"Impossible Soul\"). Though, there is not one song that is fun to listen to. It feels like work to listen to these. Track 9 is titled \"All for Myself\". That seems to be a good description of how Mr. Stevens has written this self gratifying mix of sounds.  Towards the end of track 10, \"I Want To Be Well\", Mr. Stevens repeats over and over, \"I'm not f***ing around.\" Yes, you are, Mr. Stevens. Yes, you are.\n", "val": 4.504666867433116e-05}
{"text": "After repeated listenings, I can say that Adz is neither as bad as I thought nor as good as I hoped.  Another reviewer described it as \"undisciplined,\" and I totally agree.  This album combines every sonic technique Sufjan has ever used, from the woodwind trills of \"A Sun Came\" to the electronica of \"Rabbit\" to the toy marching band of \"Michigan\" and \"Illinois\" to the folk of \"Seven Swans\" to the drum-heavy ten minute version of \"You Are the Blood,\" which Sufjan offered on the \"Dark is the Night\" compilation album in 2009.  That track is not on Adz, but it captures the kitchen sink spirit of Adz.  It's as if Sufjan just discovered a TR-808 drum pad and doesn't know how to control it.  As a result, Adz's sci-fi drum tracks are often hideously overbearing, like a soup with far too much pepper in it.  The vocals are often pitched in an uncomfortable, pinched part of his range which reverb cannot entirely obscure.If the music has been layered too much, the lyrics seem underbaked.  The track \"I Want to Be Well\" consists mainly of a looped vulgarity.  \"Impossible Soul\" has a three minute segment that repeats a single line over and over and over.  Gone are story-songs like \"Casimir Pulaski Day\" and character sketches like \"The Mistress Witch of McClure\" or \"Romulus.\"  Instead Adz has romantic songs, but the references are so veiled and vague that they fail to paint word pictures for the listener the way his older work often did. Sexual ambiguities abound as usual, with the opening track confessing, \"I think of you as my brother\" and the closing track declaring, \"Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure.\"  Song titles are short and overly obvious, almost as if he's specifically trying to deflate expectations of what we should expect from him.That said, some decent songs lurk underneath the clutter.  The opener \"Futile Devices\" shows that Sufjan still knows perfectly well how to craft a gorgeous acoustic ballad.  \"Vesuvius\" captures the _Illinois_  gang vocal spirit inside a lyric about infatuation.  The wall of vocals on \"All For Myself\" adds challenging dissonance to what's otherwise a gentle piano track.  Even the monstrous 25 minute \"Impossible Soul\" is really a suite of connected songs, with the opening and closing minutes comprising catchy tracks that can be easily isolated through MP3 editors today.\n", "val": 0.0001882607612060383}

The musical layers and lyrical musings begin to dance with each other just when it seems like they have no footing.Like the Illinois album, this one also embraces musical ideas of grandeur. But where Illinois is more tightly wound together in a bouquet of musical-esque splendor, Age of Adz seems to take the big sound in Illinois and dismantle it and give it a home here in the \"age of digital\" with synthesized sounds reminiscent of the 80's, along with instrumentation so perfectly placed within and around each theme, that only someone with the appellation of \"composer\" could be worthy of accomplishing.

His last full length was the critically acclaimed (and a personal favorite) 2005 album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Illinois/dp/B0009R1T7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Illinois</a>.  Only months following his recent EP,  Stevens drops the true follow-up to his 2005 effort, entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Age-of-Adz/dp/B004132I4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Age of Adz</a>&nbsp;(pronounced \"odds\").  The album is a departure from Stevens' most recent works, abandoning sole use of acoustic ideas in favor of electronic driven production that also incorporates acoustic elements that make Stevens so distinctive from others.  The result is a busy, overt effort that is genius for the most part.  Stevens's musicianship is apparent from the onset.The album opens with the brief \"Futile Devices,\" which finds Stevens in the comfort of his folksy sound that he has cultivated as of late.  Stevens's vocal performance is restrained, free of extra frills and overt nuance, as we have come to expect of the somewhat mysterious singer-songwriter.  The `stripped' sound of \"Futile Devices\" is quickly contrasted by the ingenious \"Too Much,\" a cut that opens with electronics instantaneously upon the first few seconds of listening.  The ideas are extremely creative and clever, finding Stevens merging his classical music brains (he still uses mixed meters) and his progressive side almost flawlessly.  He does this all while making this rather uncommercial listen have some appeal with a simplistic, yet poignant hook (\"it's too much riding on that, it's too much, too much, too much\").  While the cut is lengthy, it is enjoyable, and the bridge between the acoustic and electronic worlds is exceptional.\"Age of Adz,\" pronounced \"odds\" is an even lengthier cut, clocking it at 8:00 in duration.  Despite the length, the orchestration is experimental with superb parts for the brass and woodwind instruments.  In addition to the acoustic instruments, Stevens once again combines electronics with his knack for orchestration to make yet another five-star rated performance.  The only complaint would be that Stevens's rather quiet, reserved vocals (even at their most overt) are covered in the bombastic production work.  The track ends, however, with strummed guitar and tender vocals by Stevens - that is the Stevens we have come to be accustomed to.\"I Walked\" is another great cut, where clear vocals by Stevens laced in falsetto stand out easily.  Again, with pop songwriter's craft, Stevens writes another simple, minimalistic hook that is relevant even to the most mainstream listener.  The classical-sounding background vocals here ad a superb touch. \"Now That I'm Older\" is solid too, even if there is a `lot to take in' and `absorb' as a listener.  \"Get Real Get Right\" contrasts a slower paced \"Now That I'm Older\" with a quicker pace here.  Additionally, vocally, Stevens gets right to the point, entering much earlier with his voice than previous cuts.  Again, pop craftsmanship is executed with a nice hook.\"Bad Communication\" is one of three relatively brief cuts on this album.  As always, Stevens use of instruments here is exceptional.  \"Vesuvius\" is a stand out after several solid tracks, which begins with Stevens recapturing his acoustic ruminations.  Before the 1:00 mark, the electronic drums enter, beginning to shape \"Vesuvius\" into another electro-acoustic masterwork.  The production work is more tasteful than more bombastic performances (\"Too Much\" or \"Age of Adz\"), which is nice to hear from Stevens after so many `jam-packed' cuts.  \"All for Myself\" is another exceptional cut and the last truly brief listen.  Here, background vocals add a creative dimension, not to mention that great compositional-sense that Stevens possesses throughout this ambitious album.  \"All for Myself\" features one of the best refrains of the album, finding Stevens singing: \"We set out once, forget our shirts with hairy chests and well rehearsed, I want it all, I want it all for myself...\"\"I Want To Be Well\" keeps up the momentous trend with a `schizophrenic' nature about it.  While it clocks in at a whopping 6:29 in duration, it is well worth the listen, if for nothing else than to hear the usually clean-cut singer drop the f-bomb: \"I'm not f***ing around, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not f***ing around.\"  Sure, that's not the sole shining (or shocking) moment, as the main refrain is not too shabby itself: \"so do yourself a good, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes...\" Closing cut \"Impossible Soul\" is truly the only questionable cut - at 25:35 it finds Stevens indulging a bit to much, even for the adept `classical music listener's' soul.  There are some superb ideas and great and shocking moments (Stevens uses auto-tune!), but it is too much.  What it does do, however, is reflect the `greatest hits' of this album, with combinations of acoustic and electronic sensibilities.Exceptional album? By all means, with only few things to quibble out in my eyes.  After a five-year hiatus, I am glad one of my personal favorite musicians is back on the scene with a true, full length effort.

It was a completely awesome experience to see/hear this live!  I suddenly fell in love with some of the songs that I previously didn't like.  So either the songs really are great or Sufjan is so cunning that he can make you love anything.  Probably a bit of both.  Parts of the show reminded me of a first date that gave you butterflies in your stomach.  It was that good.  I remember thinking, \"will I still like this in the morning?\".

His albums typically had some great songs, i.e. songs with great lyrics, strong melodies and good vocals and instrumentation.  Think Chicago or Casimir Pulaski Day on Illinois or Romulus on Michigan.  His albums also had some clunkers that you just kind of ignored as you focused on the good ones.  Unfortunately on this album there are no songs of the caliber of his previous good ones and it's mostly just electronic noise and repetition.  The closest thing to a good song might be the short version of \"Too Much\" but it still doesn't measure up to his best earlier work.I had a feeling the album would get mostly good reviews because of the legion of Sufjan fans out there (and I include myself in that category) but I want to give a negative review to at least get some people to slow down and listen to the songs before buying and even more, to encourage Sufjan to write songs again as strong as his earlier albums.\n", "val": 0.00012254240573383868}

Read a little about it. It's about the artist Royal Robertson who was a schizophrenic, and the music relates to his art and life. Watch an interview or read an article where Sufjan explains his take on what you need to keep in mind when you listen to it. When Sufjan set aside time in his concert to explain to the audience what the album meant to him, it gave me entirely new perspective on the way I perceived the album. The metallic, deranged noises add to the mystique of the subject, and it creates an ethereal mood that honestly engulfs you whole.

{"text": "I don't want to like this album. I was annoyed by BQE and frustrated that it'd been so long since Sufjan had released any true new material. Illinoise is that preternatural, near-perfect album--with a depth and character and texture all its own, with whimsy and silliness but an overarching narrative and true grace--accessible, delicious music.The Age of Adz is neither accessible, nor whimsical, nor near-perfect. Instead, it takes a dark turn: built around the artwork of paranoid schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson, it is at once jarring and frustrating, but taunts with a depth and engagement unlike that of anything in recent memory.This is not friendly music. It is not easy listening. It is a journey, and an uphill one at that. It challenges you to keep up and tolerate it a bit more, offering its hand, letting you get comfortable with its strange grasp before tearing it away and slapping you in the face.But there is something captivating throughout the entire album. A few songs drag in a way that forces me to consider skipping them every time, but I find that's because incredibly slow songs run that risk with me unless I'm in a particular mood. Underneath the electronica, the pop and circumstance, the experimental robot overlord swells, there lies a consistent thread: it begs you to really listen to what's happening here. It wants you to dive deeper. If you stick with it, it will force you to re-examine the elements you wrote off as silly or masturbatory or obnoxious and see that they're placed with a tweezer and magnifying glass instead of scattershot against the wall to see what would stick. And that's the real victory of The Age of Adz.This album is entirely not for everyone. It's not for most people. There's a completely decent possibility it's not even for me. But I keep listening to it, discovering there's more to it each pass, and finding the complex melodies and strange noises and pops and flares are stuck in my head.

I must say i started listening to this with an open mind.  I could not finish this album without stopping and popping a few advils in between tracks and then stopping to see if by some chance i had 5 different songs playing at once in my media player or by chance the song got encoded with all the tracks combined into a few songs.

{"text": "I've been following Sufjan Stevens for the better part of a decade. Always blurring the lines between classy and kitsch, serious and fun, jaded and exuberant, this guy has truly left his mark on the face of modern American music.For the last several weeks, I've been touting this year's All Delighted People EP as my favorite Sufjan Stevens work yet. While not a huge departure in style from the iconic Illinois or its noteworthy successor The Avalanche, it certainly deserves its share of praise and attention. Still savoring it after many listens, I wasn't sure I was ready to hear another new work just yet.That was then.Along comes The Age of Adz, with its astonishingly fresh and different style. Stunning electronic soundscapes, boldly courageous song structures, and colorful reverb-drenched lyrics -- all silhouetted by the signature guitar melodies, orchestral flourishes, and lilting choral backdrops that are unmistakably Sufjan-- this is the work of a true master. Is there no end to this guy's brilliance?Except this is not what most fans were expecting to hear. Overwhelmingly electronic in form and style, The Age of Adz is a fresh, exciting new direction for Sufjan Stevens. Electronics are certainly not anything new in Sufjan's repertoire (see 2002's Enjoy Your Rabbit), but he uses them in a much richer, more compelling and meaningful way this time. Rather than mere experimental soundscapes, the electronics play a role as \"caregivers\" to the music - guiding it along with fascinating exuberance, adding ambiance and character, augmenting the lyrics, freshening up the melodies, yet never overshadowing the candid singer/songwriter essence at the heart of this work. Old-spirited and soulful to the core, yet unmistakably 21st century in style, this album is every bit as crazy as it is honest. At times it can be like raving at a ballet, headbanging at a symphony concert, crying at a baseball game, laughing at a funeral. Dizzyingly complex, this is a musical palette that could easily result in disaster -- but with the kiss of true genius, he made it work.I'm not going to compare this album to Illinois (they are too different), nor will I pretend to know its level of importance relative to other works (it's too early to tell). But I will say that this is one hell of a fascinating album from start to finish. I can't stop listening to it, and I don't think I will anytime soon.

I bought this without previewing it first because I have some of Sufjan Stevens' other albums and like them. I do feel fortunate that I didn't pay full price for this.

The awful title track is so much discordant noise that it should be blasted at high volume by police trying to get a criminal to surrender. Even worse is the final track. Even Meat Loaf would probably think 25:34 is too long for a song. Especially a song that essentially repeats the same chorus for 15 stinking minutes. There's another song for the cops to use if they want someone to confess a crime. Long before it got to the end the suspect would be begging for the quiet solitude of prison.Really the whole thing sounds like a kid playing with a keyboard in the music store that makes all sorts of funny noises and then recording it.

{"text": "The sudden arrival of a new album and EP by Sufjan seems to come at the end of a long period of drought. In fact, in the years since Illinois, Sufjan released a double album-length outtakes album (The Avalanche) which proved that the Illinois sessions were one of the most fruitful single album sessions in music history (if the material were to be spread over vinyl-length albums, it would make up not a double but a quadruple album set without any significant dip in quality), plus a full-length classical work (The BQE). It's not that he has been away for a long stretch; it's just that so many people seemed to want a proper follow-up to Illinois (read, more of the same please). Now, at the end of 2010, we get over two hours of new Sufjan music. The so-called EP turned out to be an album length work itself, while the new album clocks in at an hour and a quarter.The Age of Adz is an album that blends electronic sounds with choirs and symphonic pop. The sound occasionally harks back to earlier Sufjan but for the most part this is bold new musical territory. If I had to compare this work with a comparable one in any other artist's career, I would suggest Kate Bush's The Dreaming, which similarly confounded expectations and experimented with bold new sounds back in the eighties. Kate had previously found great success with idiosyncratic but gorgeously melodic songs that were also delicate and whimsical, a quality some of Sufjan's best-known songs share. She later described The Dreaming as her \"she's gone mad album,\" because on it she had crafted complex soundscapes where the melodies were often buried deep and the abrupt shifts in tone were often jarring; Kate also experimented with the sound of her voice and with the sort of instruments (piano, mainly) that were expected of her. The title track of The Dreaming seems to share something of the primitive, apocalyptic flavour one finds on the title track of The Age of Adz. The Dreaming caused confusion, but was a major step forward that eventually led to her masterpiece, Hounds of Love. Sufjan has made a similar sonic leap here.The first thing to note about the electronic sounds on this new album is that they are neither bells and whistles nor an attempt to sabotage the commercial appeal of the music (a la the barbed guitar that Sufjan used to undercut the sweetness in the exquisite Avalanche track \"Springfield\") . One review in the press has described these sounds as like listening to a Super Mario Bros. game.  On the first few listens they do indeed seem like unnecessary and distracting embellishments on the songs, the sort of pops and beeps that bristle along the surface and generally annoy. Persevere, though, and it becomes clear not not a single sound is out of place. I speak as someone who has shown absolutely no interest in electronic music before; now, having played the album about ten times, all of the sounds, even the most shrill, glaring and seemingly grafted on the top, contribute to the whole in the same way that every single instrument in an orchestra and every note played contribute to a piece of classical music.What Sufjan seems to be interested in doing as an artist is in changing the materials he uses to create his art, and in this case even in using the sort of materials that good taste dictates shouldn't be used at all. That is why we have the rasps and pops and vocoder-altered vocals. However, if you had given an artist like Picasso a bunch of materials like glue, glitter, cardboard and milk bottle tops, you still would have got a Picasso at the end of the day. The end result is the same here: another masterwork by the greatest songwriter and musician of his generation.Sufjan has spoken in the past about his interest in making people unsure whether the music they're listening to is good or bad. In other words, he seems to want to play with people's notions of good taste. Just as Spinal Tap saw the fine line between genius and stupid, there is also a surprisingly fine line between good taste and bad, and this is what seems to interest Sufjan, and why he has gone down this particular road (not to mention recording Songs For Christmas). Walking this line is obviously perilous for most artists. In fact, only one one kind of person can do it successfully. It's the G word again. There is definitely a strong tendency in Sufjan and on this album in particular to flirt with the absurd and the kitsch (just witness the cheerleading choruses on Impossible Soul). The important thing, though, is that the end result is brilliant.There is not a single misstep here. In fact there is nothing that is merely good. Astonishing and brave, this is Sufjan's third masterpiece and I welcome the next one.\n", "val": 0.006951997987926006}
{"text": "In 2003, Sufjan Stevens claimed to have begun a project where he would write one album for each of the fifty states. This lasted for two brilliant records before Stevens admitted it was more of a marketing ploy than a realistic goal. Michigan and Illinois received the royal treatment while the remaining forty-eight states are left to wonder \"what if.\" Now, five years after Illinoise hit the shelves, Sufjan Stevens has finally taken a break from Christmas songs and audio/visual experiments to release another more customary pop record, or has he?The Age of Adz opens with \"Futile Devices,\" a familiarly calm track with a simple, yet effective instrumentation and Stevens' wistful vocals. Fans may rejoice at this newest addition to Stevens' collection of beautiful melodies, but it doesn't take long to learn these celebrations are premature. Stevens' increasingly experimental tendencies quickly take over.Nearly halfway through The Age of Adz, on the track \"Now That I'm Older,\" Stevens carefully places the line \"it's different now, I think.\" This is certainly the case with Stevens' newest release, and it's a realization that hits listeners instantaneously as the second track, \"Too Much,\" begins. Sounding like a mixture of Radiohead's Kid A and Flaming Lips' Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Stevens quickly dives into electronic, syncopated rhythms, expanding his instrumentation to incorporate strings, horns and a host of other sound effects and synthesized notes.The title track, \"The Age of Adz,\" follows \"Too Much\" with a similar beep transition to Radiohead's move from \"Airbag\" to \"Paranoid Android\" on OK Computer. Like that album, The Age of Adz uses this passage as an introduction to the most complex and monumental track on the record. Sufjan Stevens' vocals uncharacteristically waver in pitch, but they fit the music perfectly. Complete with a bombastic orchestration, Stevens shows off what he is truly capable of musically and further distances himself from his previous sound as the album continues on.With the exception of the drawn out, twenty-five minute final track, \"Impossible Soul,\" that delves into the world of Auto-tune, Sufjan Stevens' new sound is almost shockingly successful. Fans hoping for a continuation of his state albums project may have a hard time grasping the complex melodies of The Age of Adz, but those listeners patient enough to give the new sound a chance will learn Sufjan Stevens has plenty left to offer.Similar Artists: Radiohead, Animal CollectiveTrack Suggestion: \"The Age of Adz\"\n", "val": 0.0024404169525951147}

{"text": "This is an amazing album, yet we all wish it were something other than what it is.For me, those \"somethings\" are:- Using halloween reverb, let's say, 70% of the time instead of 95%- Singing \"Boy, we can do much more together\" 25 times instead of 100. I mean, really?- Putting in a \"pop\" track. Come on, just throw us a bone.Oh, and this is really selfish, but can Sufjan make an album that doesn't include the word \"shoulder\"?All that aside, his work is as pioneering as ever, and I look forward to many more listenings.\n", "val": 0.005488511640578508}

Some reviewers have criticized it for being confusing or non-linear, but I think that's what makes him so brilliant. And I mean BRILLIANT. It's absolutely more electronic than anything he's done before and I for one love it. Favorite track at the moment (3rd play through) is \"Too Much.\" And the final 25 minute \"Impossible Soul,\" is nothing short of a sonic journey.And seriously, $4 !!!??? Real music at a real price.

{"text": "There's the King of Rock, King of Pop and now, after the release of Volume 5, we have the King of Karaoke.I'm convinced there are two distinct families of R.S. fans. One appreciates Rod the artist and the other is delirious for his alto ego, Rod the snoozing crooner.This CD in particular, with its odd song selection, puts me in mind of David Johansen's (New York Dolls) late 80's alter ego Buster Poindexter.  B.P. was played with a wink and a smile and achieved a modem of brief success as the convivial lounge act. No one at the time dreamed anyone, including Rod, could maintain this novelty act for a total of five CDs over a ten year period (and still counting). One has to ponder whether Rod's mentor was really Mitch Miller rather the Uncle Clive. I can't wait for Rod's preordained promotional visit to the TV show, the View. He'll chat up Barbara Walters about his love and affection for American standards and she can reminisce about her dates, in glamorous Holly wood, with Irving Berlin and being there when Irving wrote, \"There's No Business Like Show Business\". I can hear her now urging, begging Rod to add that tune to volume 6. Sorry, I digress. Can you possibly imagine Lennon, Morrison, Hendrix, pumping out this musical bilge had they lived into the September years? This CD doesn't warrant a serious review. All one has to do is read the reviews offered for volumes 1- 4. Nothing has changed but song titles. All five volumes might as well have been recorded with the original CD in 2001. In fact, maybe all the tunes were recorded during this period.  I have a rule of thumb; beware of movies, books or CDs with titles that end with numbers 3 or greaterLet's face it.  This career direction is perfectly logical, when you take your counsel from the accountants rather then listening to your creative muse. Remember, He's now spent the majority of his life nestled in Beverly Hills, obsessing over polo ponies and such. Crooning Tin Pan Alley nuggets makes perfect sense. What else does he know at this stage? The lad is a long, long way from his roots in Gasoline Alley.Just think, he turned down a recent Faces European reunion tour with his mates to market and promote this dreadful project.It's truly sad when the business model trumps the artist.  Fortunately, other artists from Rod's generation are still out there creating, playing and performing relevant music. I invite you to listen to recent CD releases , Ronnie Wood's \" I Feel like Playing \",  Joe Cocker's \"Hard Knocks \"  Elton Johns' \"The Union\" , Neil Young's\" Le Noize \" and Robert Plant's\" Band of Joy \".These legends are following their muse and creating original work.  They're willing to take commercial risks to gain the creative rewards. As an artist, not a business person, that's what it's all about. Art / music, when it's real, is about excitement not safe.As for Rod, I'd suggest exploring his back catalogue. The Great American Songbook series is nothing more then the \"Long Goodbye \".\n", "val": 0.0031545821111649275}

{"text": "Blessed or cursed with a distinctive voice Rod Stewart would not have been my first guess to successfully 'cover' the old standards from a highly polished vocal era. But on this CD, I think, he does more than cover, he rethinks, repackages in some cases tempo, in other backing vocals, still others orchestration that all in all best showcases his voice, phrasing, and best of all allows him to emotionally connect with the material.This is not a small thing, many if not all of these songs are so well known with ONE particular vocalist that to carve a whole new interpretation of the words and music is much like repainting Mona Lisa and finding no one remembers that 'other' version by that da Vinci guy. A good example would be his version of an old (and to me, beloved) Bobby Darin song, Beyond the Sea, which I never thought could be owned by anyone else, for any reason. Surprise! I now have them on my playlist next to each other, both are just perfect for the VOICES these men have/had.Stewart must have clearly loved these songs, he is patient, tender, whimsical, breathy where necessary, with nice and subtle backing vocalists, and an orchestration that doesn't fight or compete or overload what his voice can do (and can't do). There were numerous surprises, a really interesting take on the Love Me or Leave Me, Sunny Side of the Street, and I Get A Kick Out of you.One of the strengths Stewart brings to EACH song is his maturity, as in personal maturity, it permeates each phrase, beautifully compliments the words and even pauses. He has his timing down for these songs as if they were being sung for the first time by anyone. That is quite impressive.That sometime gravelly sometime airy sometime thin voice stretching to hit a note can be - at first - a \"uh oh\" moment (ex. Fly Me to the Moon and Moon River, which were my least favorites initially)  but give it a chance, Rod the Bod still has that grin in his voice, that twinkle in his eye, still a little velvet still lingering in his throat and a whole lot of deep affection for these songs. I don't know how it compares to the first 4 volumes, as I said, I heard Beyond the Sea by him and was entranced, so if the other 4 volumes are as good I have alot of vibrant music coming my way.\n", "val": 0.016313889995217323}

They tended to be more like Stewart's musical renditions from recent decades.  The tempo was often jarring within the context of the first four volumes.  It seemed at times like the tracks were rushed through to production with none of the care and niceties of the earlier volumes.  The first four volumes sound and feel like they belong together.

{"text": "\"Who would have imagined back in 2001 with the launch of The Great American Songbook, that nearly a decade later we'd still be going strong with Volume V?\" ~ Rod Stewart ~In 2002, he shocked his Rock & Roll fans by recording&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/It-Had-to-Be-You-The-Great-American-Songbook/dp/B00006JL4J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">It Had to Be You... The Great American Songbook</a>. That was the first of the Songbook series. It took the music world by storm. It was a bestseller album not only in the USofA but worldwide as well. Although not most of his Rock & Roll fans embraced the album, the Hall of Famer Rod Stewart gained a new breed of fans--myself included--that welcomed and embraced him as an interpreter of The Great American Songbook.In 2003, he came up with the next series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/As-Time-Goes-By-The-Great-American-Songbook-Volume-II/dp/B0000C9ZEX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">As Time Goes By...The Great American Songbook: Volume II</a>.

I was surprised upon learning last year in September that there will be an upcoming release for \"Fly Me To The Moon...The Great American Songbook, Volume V.\" I immediately pre-ordered it and it was delivered on 18th of October 2010, one day before its scheduled release. (Thanks AMZN for timely delivery. You are simply the best web site on Planet Earth! As a customer/reviewer on my 9th year now, I never had any single problem with delivery and service in general).Is Volume V better than the previous series? Is it the best from all the five? Or is the best still to come? After listening to the two-CD set DeLuxe Edition, I then re-listened to the first, second, third, fourth volumes and compared notes. This latest offering has charms of its own. Firstly, the selected material is outstanding. There's never a weak link in the sequence of tracks. Secondly, Rod Stewart shines the most in his interpretations of \"September In The Rain\" (loved that terrific vibes solo by Alex Navarro), \"What A Difference A Day Makes,\" \"My Foolish Heart,\" \"When I Fall In Love,\" \"Beyond The Sea\" and the title track, \"Fly Me To The Moon.\"And thirdly, if you like to listen to an innovately fresh and upbeat rendition of \"Love Me Or Leave Me,\" with the opening verse, this is the latest version to consider. Joe Sample, a fine jazz pianist, joins Rod the Fab and lends his expertise in piano playing. The background vocals are so delightful and add verve to the rendition.Lastly, Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" is also a highlight. Its pretty arrangement is one of the most impressive charts ever written. It's so wonderful to hear the combined sounds of guitar, violins, mandolin.What else is there to say?

Nothing against Rod, who is a great singer in his own right, but when it comes to these songs, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of versions that are superior. Perhaps it's not fair to put Rod up against Ella, the Queen of the Songbooks, but this particular song illustrates why it's not worth anyone's time or money to buy this version when far better - incredibly, indisputably better - versions exist out there. If you love this music, go buy one of Ella's songbooks. Or Sinatra, Tony Bennett, and so on. But don't waste your money on Rod's versions.\n", "val": 0.00016006171063054353}

{"text": "I suspect that folks who buy this stuff are unfamiliar with the \"Great American Songbook\" and when they hear one of these timeless songs they enjoy it so much they rush out to buy Rod's version. He has chosen some beautiful classics to record. Really though, you should look for these songs as performed by great Jazz artists like Diana Krall, Frank Sinatra, Chet Baker, Eileen Farrell, Bill Charlap, Stan Getz, Tony Bennett, Ben Webster or Billie Holiday. You would be amazed at how great these songs are when performed by someone with the musical ability to provide a valid interpretation. Rod must be laughing all the way to the bank! His rock and roll material is awesome-no question. But he has neither the talent nor the skill to successfully interpret this material. His croaking efforts make me cringe!!!! Perhaps Kermit should consider recording some romantic songbook material?I just hope other aging rockers don't decide to cash in and emulate Rod. Can you imagine Robert Plant warbling \"Stairway to the Stars\"? Or Mick Jagger growling \"You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To\"? If Jim Morrison were still around, I guess I wouldn't mind hearing his version of \"Sleep Warm\". After all, he was a serious fan of Frank Sinatra and had the chops to successfully mimic some elements of Frank's style in some of his better love songs!One rock artist who can turn in credible interpretations of this type of music is Brian Ferry.

It's Rod Stewart's favourite track & hence the title as well as the inner sleaves's writing. \"Sunny Side Of The Street\", is rather a weak song from this CD. \"Moon River\", is a closing track, starts rather weakly somewhat but picks up momentum with great orchestral sound & accordion later on. On overall, this is a great effort by Rod Stewart to give a kick to great classics to let them fly again, a recommended listening.\n", "val": 0.01164364442229271}

Many know Rod's family years singing around the piano with his Dad and others as a child, learning the \"right\" way to sing these standards.

J Records, a small time studio took on the task of helping recreate this Big Band music when Rod's Pop label refused to take a chance. Wow are they sorry? You betcha. Rod still turns out pop music but the latest list of tunes, well, how can I say it but \"It's wonderful! Marvellous\"!

{"text": "Rod Stewart has truly outdone himself with this incredibly beautiful set of songs that he sings with all his heart and soul. Sure, I understand that some of his fans who liked his work from days now gone by are disappointed; this is not the Rod Stewart they knew and loved as an artist who gave us some really strong, rockin' tunes like \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy.\" On the other hand, however, this album is actually selling quite well; and I think it's selling well for two reasons: Rod's fan base has become so diverse that he can successfully release this fifth installment of his \"Great American Songbook\" series; and some fans of Rod Stewart's earlier work also enjoy this type of music. It can happen! Another thing I like about this album is that because Rod does covers on this album, we can hear and enjoy just how fine an interpreter he is of these very special standards. Indeed, there's not a weak track on the disc; Rod sings to perfection and beyond! In addition, with those musical arrangements by people like producer Richard Perry, this is an album to get and enjoy.\"That Old Black Magic\" provides an auspicious starter number for this album; and it all holds its own very well. Excellent! \"Beyond The Sea\" is equally well done; and I really like other tracks including \"I've Got You Under My Skin;\" \"What a Difference a Day Makes;\" \"I Get a Kick Out of You\" with that especially lush arrangement and Rod's sublime rendition of \"I've Got the World on a String\" with that excellent horn solo.\"Love Me or Leave Me\" sounds just great; and there are yet more gems in \"My Foolish Heart;\" \"September in the Rain,\" a tune I first heard performed by Dinah Washington; a most passionate treatment of \"Fly Me to the Moon;\" a faultless \"Sunny Side Of The Street\" and the closing track, \"Moon River\" which was one of my mother's favorite songs ever. How that brings back memories!This is the strongest installment in Rod's \"Great American Songbook\" CD series; this music is all THAT good. I highly recommend this for any fan of classic pop vocals; and fans of Rod Stewart who enjoy this type of music as well as his previous work will not be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.0418240986764431}

{"text": "On a November evening back in 1996, I found myself hanging out with my cousin Tim and his best friend Bob.  Knowing that both were confirmed bachelors and neither were especially close to immediate family, I asked if either had plans for Thanksgiving dinner.  Almost needless to say, neither had any.  So I invited both to join my wife and I at our house for the holiday, and they accepted my invite.Now here in Buffalo, NY, the night before Thanksgiving is THE biggest bar night of the year.  And Tim and Bob celebrated the occasion to the tune of five hours of downing bad draft beer followed by a three burrito night-cap, then pouring themselves back home at 5 am!  When they showed up at my house at 3 pm the next day, they were still a bit under the weather.  Still, we all managed to enjoy a feast and endure a clean-up.  After which, we went into the living room to sip a desert wine and watch the fourth quarter of the late afternoon football game.  That's when Tim started to let off some bodily exhaust.  And let me tell you that it was rotten!  Rank!  Retched!  Above all, it was room-clearing!  After the third panicked b-line to the kitchen and the door to some fresh air; my wife noticed that Bob was not joining us.  Instead, he would stay behind with Timmer idiotically laughing as if someone had worked magic.  Though in all fairness, not everyone can make two people disappear!  Anyway, I asked Bob what the deal was.  As it turned out, Bob had been involved in a car accident several years prior that cost him his sense of smell!  Wow, that really cleared things up back then and even now!Fast forward to the year 2002.  If you were like me, you were scratching your head over Rod Stewart's It Had to Be You... The Great American Songbook.  How could a former great like Stewart stoop to recording a bunch of standards now silly in their old age.  Then complete the trifecta with hokey arrangements and dime-store orchestrations.  Not only that, but then regurgitate the bad idea four more times (five if you count his \"Rock Classics\" collection).  How/why?  Folks, we only need to think back to Bob on Thanksgiving evening in 1996, and give Stewart the benefit of the doubt.  He MUST have lost his sense of smell in an unfortunate accident!  I mean how else could Stewart not detect the stench of his 2000's output?  Maybe he lost his hearing?  Either way, this bad CD is not even for Stewart completists.  It is for one type only.  That is the several of you who are having thanksgiving guests that you do not overly like, but need to invite out of a sense of obligation.  Simply buy this CD and put it on after dinner.  Then idiotically laugh at the audio equivalent of what happened to my wife and me in 1996.  Finally, proceed to enjoy the evening football game in peace minus the annoying guests!\n", "val": 2.4654340450069867e-05}

{"text": "In the words of Elton John, \"karaoke albums don't count.\"Ever since he started recording these abysmal theme records nearly a decade ago, Rod Stewart has been more about surface appearance than sound. His album covers from this period make that evident. Unfortunately, donning a snazzy suit and singing chestnuts does not make one Tony Bennett any more than tossing on a leather jacket and ripped jeans makes one Joey Ramone or sporting a soulful swoon makes one Al Green.In the world of Rod Stewart image is consistently at the forefront, especially on this disc, where he sounds in perpetual need of a throat lozenge. While his voice has coolly mellowed, not every show biz veteran emanates nostalgic gold on cue.This music is as much about marketing and product-placement as the drivel being spilled out by acts such as Katy Perry or Ke$ha, with little to no soul, substance or artistry behind it. The only difference is the demographic being aimed at - here, baby boomers with only a minimal amount of sophistication or taste (if that) who know this material is \"good for them\" but do not have the energy, drive or impetus to locate performances of these songs from better, more suitable vocal interpreters. \"Rod Stewart\" is therefore more a brand and familiar face in this context.The arrangements are textured and nicely orchestrated, and Stewart usually sounds like he is supplying differing emotions as he moves in and out of the tracks - and these are, after all, some of the best songs ever written. Even a minimum of competence as a singer can make the likes of \"What a Difference a Day Makes\" and \"I've Got the World on a String\" sound fine.Stewart displays a minimum of enthusiasm for the material and his job as singer, so it all does sound \"fine\" - not transcendent, not brilliant, not particularly soulful, rich or stirring - in other words, not good enough.In an era where we, by some wonderful luck, still have Tony Bennett regularly touring and hitting the backs of concert halls, unmiked, with his rendition of Bart Howard's \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" there is simply no need to hear Rod Stewart sleepwalk his way through it. It is redundant, reductive, excessive and unwholesome all at once, much like the experience of Michael Buble performing Sinatra bastardization in a predictable suit and tie. Mimicry is not art.Go to the nearest jazz hole in the wall you can find if music really matters to you. Order a cocktail and sit down. You are guaranteed to have a more genuine experience than you would have playing this CD or seeing one of Mr. Stewart's overpriced concerts.And if that's out of reach, try any album by Madeleine Peyroux.\n", "val": 0.0012928149662911892}

{"text": "It has been over a year since Rod Stewart has released a record, and unfortunately he did dissapoint. After the lackluster Soulbook album last year, and his mixed 2006 Still The Same: Rock Classics cover album, he has tried to rekindle the songs that made him a crooner from this past decade. It unfortunately has felt like he did turn off a lot of his die hard Forever Young fans, while he did have a few nice wrinkles re-issued from his classics a few years ago including a re-issuing of his Storyteller boxed set, and his acclaimed Unplugged & Seated from 1993. But with all that hype, Rod has decided to back to his crooner fashion, and try to revise his songboook series. But is it worth while? Well, maybe Ol' Blue Eyes would've not been convinced.Fly Me To The Moon: The Great American Songbook Volume V, is Rod Stewart's return to his songbook series, that really revised him as a strong and soulful crooner. This time around, he tackles covers from Dinah Washington, and The Chairman Of The Board Frank Sinatra, in this collection. The songs aren't bad on some of the covers including I've Got You Under My Skin, I've Got The World On A String, and What A Difference A Day Made. Rod does noblely well, but he does overdo Sinatra's standards here on the record as a back to basics here, instead of trying other standards from other acts that he could've done like Sammy Davis Jr. & Dean Martin to just name a few.While Fly Me To The Moon: The Great American Songbook Volume V, isn't a bad buy from Rod Stewart, it still honestly a much better covers' album than the one Santana made at the same time. But, it honestly isn't as domiant as the covers' album Phil Collins released last month with his Going Back album. That one was more lively. Still, if Rod does release another Great American Songbook volume, it should be more diverse from other kinds of standards' acts. Still if you've loved Rod's first four volumes of The Great American Songbook, you'll definitely like Volume V.Album Cover: BSongs: C 1/2+Price: CMastering: COverall: C+\n", "val": 0.002819537417963147}

{"text": "Oh, Rod Stewart, what's happened to you? I miss the Rod Stewart of yesteryear - the rocker, party-animal and bad boy who gave us such hits as \"Hot Legs\", \"Rhythm of my Heart\", \"Forever Young\", and \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy.\" Now we're left with a cover artist who's traded in everything that made him a star and appealing who churns out albums full of cover songs of old American classics. \"Fly Me to the Moon ... The Great American Songbook Volume V\" is really not that different from the first four albums of the American Songbook series. For one album, the one where he covered classic rock songs, there was a hint of the old Rod Stewart but now we're back to this crooner imitation that Stewart's been playing with for the past few years.In listening to this album, I wanted to break down this review by tracks. Then I realized that there really was nothing great to say about the individual tracks on this album. I will start off by saying one good thing: thank goodness the music of this release is more upbeat and overall happier than the tracks chosen for the other songbook volumes. That simple change of going for the most swing/upbeat orchestral arrangement of the songs makes \"Fly Me to the Moon\" stand out in the series.Now, for the bad news. My problem with \"Fly Me to the Moon\" and the other four volumes of this American Songbook series is that it is really lacking in Rod Stewart. I'll explain. I get it - as artists get older, they want to change or do something differently musically. This thing of covering old American classics, however, has been dragged out entirely too long in my opinion and is truly killing the musical legacy Rod Stewart made. These tracks are nothing more than high profile karaoke. Where's the feeling? Where's the emotion, the spark that makes you nod your head in appreciation of the sentiment and emotion; the unique spin that makes you feel like you're listening to Rod Stewart? This album, and the others of this American Songbook series are pretty annoying and disappointing because every track is sung almost entirely the same as the next. There's no real emotional exploration going on or personalization happening. To me, the tracks sound very similar and therefore feel uninteresting because it feels like Rod Stewart or his record company realize they'll make money with him being a cover artist either way and he's grown very comfortable not investing himself into the music or songs because they're already familiar to most of his audience.This feels like a lazy effort from Rod Stewart with no real creativity or talent being exhibited. There are a few tracks worth listening to: \"Moon River,\" \"Sunny Side of the Street\", \"Fly Me to the Moon\" have traces of the old Rod Stewart but still, I find it hard to believe that the once rocker Stewart who in interviews likes to to point out how he doesn't feel old or irrelevant has gone from being such a stand out artist to being nothing more than a good cover artist. I'd like to have heard a few original tracks mixed into this album; we haven't been treated to truly new, original content from Rod Stewart in years and I believe all of this covering of the American classics he's done over the years has made him a bit weak as an artist because he's singing every song with the same emotion and tone and is showing little range. I say skip this. It's really not anything new or anything unique worth throwing your money at.Listen to These: \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" \"Sunny Side of the Street,\" \"Moon River.\"\n", "val": 2.955743002530653e-05}

Trusty, tried and true yet boring. I fail to understand why Rod doesn't record some blues. His voice is meant for more depth.  He dabbled with the soul book but those song choices were soul \"lite\" and nothing earthy and powerful enough to showcase his wonderful voice.I realize he loves these songs and he grew up surrounded by them but I'm ready to hear his voice really blow me back with some haunting rolling back water swampy rumbling folksy blues.

While I prefer Rod when he's singing rock or soul songs, \"Fly Me To The Moon\" is a very good album.Rod's last album, \"Soulbook,\" was amazing, so I wasn't too pleased when I heard he was revisiting the safe \"Great American Songbook\" series. Thankfully, this album is solid throughout.  There aren't too many surprises here. It's a relaxing, mellow collection that is perfect for when you're entertaining or trying to relax after a hard day at work. The song selection is very good and the arrangements are much more interesting than some of the other volumes in the series. They said this was the most \"danceable\" songbook yet, and - for the most part - they delivered.The only complaint I have is there are two version of this album. There is the regular version (12 tracks) and the \"Deluxe\" version (18 tracks). I bought the Deluxe version, as I'm sure many hardcore Rod fans will do. While the packaging is beautiful, all 18 songs would have easily fit on one CD. This was clearly done to make more money. I don't blame Rod. I'm sure the decision was made by J Records. Go ahead and pay a few more bucks for the Deluxe version. You won't regret it. Rod's version of \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" is worth the price of admission.Overall this is a very good Rod Stewart album that I think fan's of the \"Great American Songbook\" series will enjoy. Rod sounds like he's having fun on many of these tracks, and his excitement is contagious. \"Sunny Side Of The Street\" is perfect for him, and he did a beautiful job with the lovely song \"Moon River.\" Pick up this album, and you'll find yourself singing and swinging in no time!\n", "val": 0.04169804975390434}

{"text": "I will be honest that as an ardent fan of Rod Stewart since 1972, it was somewhat challenging to see Rod dedicate the better part of a decade to the classics of the Great American Songbook. However I wasn't prepared for this wonderfully new side of Rod. He has placed his \"Rod Stamp\" on these songs from the 1940's that so many people love--a whole new audience for Rod and more importantly, a genre of songs that he personally absolutely loves. It exceeds a typical \"covers album\". Songbook has introduced me personally to music that I had only previously heard played in old movies or love stories. Songbook is indeed The Great American Love Book.I was very fortunate to see and hear Rod sing his entire new album \"Fly Me to the Moon--Songbook V\"--live from the audience of Home Shopping Network. He brings these songs alive--his voice is in great form--the diction, the inflection in his voice and the feeling that he puts into them makes you think of a better time and will bring you to tears. My favorites on this ablum are:  Moon River, I get a Kick out of You, I've got you under my Skin and That old Black Magic. This is the fifth and final segment of Songbook and it rounds out the Great American Songbook series nicely. You will enjoy this one and if you don't own the other four in the series--you need to purchase and enjoy them too. It will be quite a collection for you to own. \"Fly me to the Moon\" over this one for sure!  Marcy in Pittsburgh\n", "val": 0.040750280022621155}
{"text": "It is only fitting for Rod Stewart to seemingly request, 'fly me to the moon', on the final chapter of his Great American Songbook collection, as he has clearly conquered music on this planet.The songbooks are a tribute to Rod's success in the music industry, as he is given the opportunity to perform the music genre that is most special to him. The irony is, we all get rewarded with his impeccable effort on these wonderful songs. Remember, even a fan of ranting rock n' roll, finds time to enjoy a glass of wine with the delightful sounds of these classic hits; performed in a style that is unmistakable, Rod.\n", "val": 0.04517465829849243}

I've been a Die-Hard ROD Fan since 'Maggie May' and nothing makes me happier than still seeing his name on TOP of the CHARTS!

He is like a VERY FINE wine - he only gets better with age.  It's by far the BEST Christmas gift you can get for someone, so go on out and get it for someone special.  You will NOT be disappointed.  It is so upbeat that he has even said he will incorporate some of these songs in his next tour - and anyone who has ever seen Rod in concert KNOWS what an upbeat performer he is.

I'm a huge Baker fan and love his work from beginning to end. This record represents a paramount moment in a very unusual career. It's a portrait of the artist at the height of his power with everything around him necessary for perfection. If you love Baker, you will be in ecstasy.

It's a CD that I intend to wear out a few times through the years.

For Bruno Mars, whom has really hit a groove on his own and with B.O.B., has had a few hits that've really made it to call his own, and a few nice songs too. His latest from his debut album Doo Wops & Hooligans, The Lazy Song isn;t bad at all. It really is a nice laid back diddy. While it isn't as good of a feel-good songa s was with Jason Mraz's I'm Yours a couple of years ago, but it still is very nice to listen to. I found The Lazy Song to be not so lazy at all, but I thought the video was cute with him jamming and dancing with dancers wearing monkey masks, in fine harmony with each other. That was adorable. I hope Bruno can come out with some more nice songs like this one. He has been a grab with the mainstream that hasn't felt like he is lazy.Song: B 1/2-\n", "val": 0.016586709767580032}

However, I learned a long time ago that the instruments create music, not the words. And his voice is an amazing instrument. If you are looking for great lyrics, get into poetry. This song has meaning, emotion, and has a lot of soul. I listen to everything, primarily rock, pop rock, and metal, but this song had me feeling really good on a bad day. So props to Bruno Mars, that voice is amazing. Listen to it, if you like it, buy it. If you don't then don't.

Sometimes i even play it at work and a few co-workers join in as well and it seems to lighten things up and make the day so much better. its interesting how a song can change a person's mood just like that, and why not let it become a good mood instead of a bad one!. Definitely, however its not the kind of song to play ALL the time!!! That's how a song gets annoying and loses whatever it had going for it.The music video just makes me laugh and thats what Im sure bruno mars was trying to accomplish with this song and like i said i think its great.So...enjoy the song and let it make your day or make you go...yep Im not doing anything today.

{"text": "Bruno Mars (Peter Gene Hernandez) has been in a musical family, since birth. He has Philipino, Hawaiian and Puerto-Rican backrounds and his musical influence has spanned even wider.He has co-written songs for  : K'naan (Waving Flag), Flo-Rida (Right Round), Adam Levine, Cee-lo (F*** You) and manyyyy more. Him and his producion team - The SMEEZINGTONS are on fire and so in demand.He wrote and produced all the songs on this album. He moved to LA at 17 and has to work his way up, hitting the low point of having to sell all his instruments and being at the risk of having his phone bill cut off. He has worked so hard for this album and every track is a SMEEZE (a hit).\"Grenade\" - he pours his HEART, SOUL and KIDNEY into it.\"Runaway Baby\" - fun track I have on repeat.\"Talking to the Moon\" - you've felt like this too\"The lazy song\" - Jason Mraz like genius.His voice has been perfected and come clear crisp and smooth. Youtube his live videos for the SAME voice. No auto-tune or anything.I got dissuaded by the cocaine charge as well, but as I read more into it, I found that he did it ONE night after a show in Las Vegas, and it was the first time he'd done drugs (hence why he got caught like 10 mins after -_- ) He called the mistake \"foolish\" and got off with a warning from the LAPD cause it was his first offence.BUY his album.I used to illegally download. But this man actually deserves a PURCHASEEE.So good.And he's influenced by Doowop music.Brunooo Mars all the way man!\n", "val": 0.004605247173458338}

{"text": "Bruno Mars first caught the attention of most when he appeared on B.o. B's hit \"Nothin' on you\" followed by Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\", not to mention he co-penned Flo-Rida's \"Right Round\" and co-produced K'Naan's \"Wavin' Flag\". Now comes his debut album and he runs through a variety of styles from Reggae (the lilting \"Our First Time\", \"The Lazy Song\", the deep dub \"Liquor Store Blues\" with Damian Marley), Rock (\"Runaway Baby\"), to Pop and Funk on everything else.The tender \"Grenade\" (with soothing harmonies) finds him declaring \"I'd catch a grenade for you / Throw my hand on a blade for you / I'd jump in front of train for you/You know I'd do anything for you\", all for a girl who won't do the same for him. \"Just The Way You Are\" is set to skittery martial beats, \"Marry You\" is sixties-style Pop (with rather cheesy lyrics), \"Talking To The Moon\" an expansive ballad on which he gets to really flex his impressive vocals (reminiscent at times of Michael Jackson), and the Folky \"Count On Me\" sounds very Jack Johnson.Last but definitely not least is the ultra catchy upbeat \"The Other Side\" with a nice spoken bridge featuring B.o. B and Cee-Lo adding his soulful vocals. \"It's better if you don't understand\" goes the refrain to an enchanting wall of harmonies. I had feared this would turn out to be one of those over-rated albums, but it is definitely a winner!\n", "val": 0.005369204096496105}

{"text": "Regarding Rocky Mountain Radar detectors, I have a virtually brand new RMR Model #475 radar detector that I have been told by RMR that it has old technology, and the reason why I have been getting stopped recently, going by cops with cameras pointed right at me and not getting any signals at all, etc. The only thing this detector does well is make a lot of noise every time it goes by buildings, but never when there is monitoring going on via speed traps, cops in a cars near me, etc.I have been using radar detectors since the beginning and, although it was considered big money at the time costing almost $300, the Escort was the best detector I've ever had. But after about 30 years, even it needed to be replaced regarding losing sensitivity and new technologies coming along. But if RMR thinks I'm going to be buying new units from them every year or so, it might be better to go back to Escort and spend a little more money, regarding at least you are getting what you are paying for.I was even offered, as the only thing RMR could do for me, to send my detector in for $60 to get it upgraded, but was told the upgrade wasn't going to put the new technologies into it. So why don't I just save the time time and throw some more money in the toilet?!?I new the new technologies make things real light, but I'm not sure there is really much more than a couple of lights and lot of noise makers in their units.When I stopped using my Escort I was still able to sell it, regarding it still was of some value and able to do some detecting. When I get my next detector, there is no way that I'm going to be able to comfortably sell this RMR detector to anyone, unless I knew they were looking to get screwed by buying something absolutely useless.\n", "val": 1.6522224541404285e-05}

I'm still trying to figure out what CD the guys were listening to who say they are older, raised on rock, etc.  This is glossy candy-pop and about as soulless as production machine music can get.I saw Bruno Mars do a genuine R&B style performance on TV.  That's NOT what you will find on this CD.  He's definitely a capable singer, but this CD has been so badly and so consistently mis-categorized that I wonder who shops at Amazon these days.  The first two songs sound like Katy Perry's little brother imitating big sis.  Most of the rest sounds like a juvenile Michael Jackson wannabe singing clumsy, overly suggestive lyrics in an attempt to seduce little girls.  BAD BAD BAD!Is it danceable?  Sure is, and well produced.  But the content is mindless at best, and sometimes seriously inappropriate for what is probably the target audience.  It also doesn't take long to reach the point of annoyance to anyone who was expecting anything like a couple of Mars' TV performances.  That guy was nowhere near the studio when this drivel was put together.PASS - Spend your music dollar on something real instead of this cookie cutter nonsense.\n", "val": 3.2540192478336394e-05}

{"text": "Bruno Mars was inescapable in 2010. I first heard of him on B.o. B's Nothin' On You. It was too sugary for me back then, but I've matured and found a new love for his music.I was one of his most anticipated follower's circa 2012 when Unorthodox Jukebox was on the eve of dropping. I have to say he nailed it on both cds. I think this will be pretty close to a clean sweep.If you are somehow new to Bruno Mars, I will point out his hits that are the best. He is known for his poppy singles and infectious singing. I think if he could start picking better singles he could outdo Michael Jackson.1) Grenade- The second single. It's a huge hit, if a bit dramatic. People said he changed on his second cd. I can confirm that it's a singable song, so if you like to sing along, check this one out. 5 out of 52) Just the Way You Are- The first single. It's great when a debut single hits number 1. That was what happened, and the ladies swooned. It's good enough to bump anywhere. If you don't like sugary sweet, give it some time, the singing will infect you. 5 out of 53) Our First Time- Here is one of my favorite songs on the cd. Bruno Mars is a true artist, as he can make album cuts. I believe this could have been a single. It melts into your brain. Real hooky. 5 out of 54) Runaway Baby- A real short song, and out of character. So much for a perfect cd. It has a lot of energy, but it doesn't suit Bruno Mars. He is better as a smooth serenade. 2 out of 55) The Lazy Song- The third single. I have memories of this song. The farther I get away from 2011, the happier I'll be. You can do what the song says and laze around. Check this one out it's a sleeper. 5 out of 56) Marry You- The fourth single. Here it is. My favorite song on the cd. Bruno is untouchable on this song. It is singable and smooth. I REALLY hope Bruno Mars makes a dozen more of these songs on his third album. This is something you can get in your head easily. 5 out of 57) Talking to the Moon- At first I thought Bruno lost his pace. But it's as addictive as 5 of the first six songs. Kind of different, but we can't have the same kind of song all the time can we? His singing is really infectious. 5 out of 58) Liquor Store Blues- Kind of a reggae type track. Damian Marley is even featured. He tries to do a bit of everything, when r&b is what he should be doing. The hook is smooth. This is a suprising number. Everything falls into place. 5 out of 59) Count On Me- The fifth single. Here is Bruno Mars shining point. When he does smooth talking r&b. All of the singles have been huge, but Bruno can make good songs as well. Check this one out if you've only heard Bruno Mars on the radio. 5 out of 510) The Other Side- I think this is the only song I've never really listened to on the cd. I think it's electric. Cee Lo does exceptionally well on his verse. I think you'll like the hook. 5 out of 5Bruno Mars is a monster. He does things to a tee. I'd have to say he is as big as Akon for r&b albums that I like. If you are new to r&b definitely check him out. He was the artist of 2013.The only song that did not stick out to me was Runaway Baby. All the rest are 5 star.Pros:Bruno Mars can songwrite and all the songs are hooky singalongs.Cons:One song. Runaway Baby is out of Bruno's element.Great Music to Play While: Getting ready to go out\n", "val": 0.010293511673808098}

{"text": "The first time I heard the name Bruno Mars when at a summer pride festival when a local band in my area called The Blast Addicts did a version of his song \"The Lazy Song\". I'd seen this album around but paid it little attention. Over time I've had more exposure to his young hipster attitude and his inspired state show,I began to realize this might just be a talent worth exploring. It's been a very long time since I heard an artist whose songs were inspiring interpretation so early in the game. While references to him as \"the new Michael Jackson\" were a complete turn off at first,considering how few artists will ever likely live up to a vibrant talent on the level of MJ again, But what was this man going to have to say on his own terms?  The first two songs on this album \"Grenade\" and \"Just The Way You Are\" do in fact possess that epic production sound so common today,however the pop-soul song craft of the compositions themselves are really quite amazing. My personal favorite track here is the slinky funk/reggae of \"Our First Time\",with it's beautifully jazzy chord changes.\"Runaway Baby\" is a high octane,guitar based funk rocker where \"The Lazy Song\" pulls pop,soul,funk and light hip-hop rhtyhms together for a song celebrating the sometimes slacker spirit of youth. The same impulse carries on into the sparse new wave style \"Marry You\",though this time seeking a commitment through naivety.  \"Talking To The Moon\" is a moody,reflective piano based ballad.  Damian Marley shows up for the heavy reverbed reggae of \"Liquor Store Blues\",an ode to drowning sorrows where \"Count On Me\" is a sweet little acoustic based song with a strong Caribbean flavor. The ending finds Mars as a soul man supreme on the heavily Stax inspired \"The Other Side\" recorded,of course with Cee Lo Green. Brimming with youthful charm and innocence this singer/songwriter/musician also shows great potential for a significant,long term creative expansion as he grows artistically. He puts a great deal of thought into his writing and his musical ideas. And while it's clear he operates on many levels firmly within the contemporary musical idiom,his basic musical flavors come out of 60's and 70's sunshine pop melodies-through the filters of the soul,funk and reggae music he clearly loves. Probably the idea pop album for this particular time period.\n", "val": 0.011018767021596432}

I like all the songs a lot but my top three in order are probably \"Just The Way You Are\" (it never gets old), \"Talking To The Moon\" and either \"Grenade\" or \"Count On Me\". I just love this CD to death. I docked some points because the album at 10 tracks is simply over before I want it to be. Next album has to be at the very least 12 tracks for me to be happy. It wouldn't hurt if he occasionally broke away from his writing team and penned 2 or 3 tracks by himself too. However, I would still buy it regardless.

I always liked his voice but never got too into him, until after I heard him perform \"Valerie\" on MTV as a tribute to Amy Winehouse, after that I was hooked. So I purchased the album and also his EP, and I can't get enough of him! He is clearly super talented not only in song writing but his voice is mesmerizing and a TRUE talent. You can listen to the live recordings, or even go to youtube and search for him in concert, and his voice is just as amazing live as on the album, which is rare now days. He has said himself that his lyrics are simple ans to the point, and he is right which is why I love him even more. Some songs are obviously superior to others, but all in all I greatly enjoy each song on the album, there isn't one that I don't listen to.I believe \"Talking To The Moon\" should have been released as a single, because it is a wonderful song and his voice is beautiful. I feel like you can feel his emotion through his voice in each song. His voice has even made me enjoy the rap songs he is featured in, when I usually hate rap!

He and his production team masterfully create songs that are very easy to listen to and enjoy, and just make you feel good.  Even the more \"emo\" tracks (\"Grenade\", \"Talking to the Moon\", \"Liquor Store Blues\") have a lighthearted feel to them.  Nothing groundbreaking or challenging here, just allow yourself to be serenaded by Bruno's carefree notes and you will be very satisfied.

My personal favorites are Grenade and Talking to the Moon because it's very emotional, and you can feel the desperation in his voice. It's very believable. His music is amazing, but it's even better live. He doesn't shortcut any of his songs; he sings every single (high) note on his CD, and not an octave lower.

Grenade: 5/5 This is hands down one of the best on the CD, though it's incredibly overplayed.2. Just The Way You Are: 4/5 Its good, but its so girly, and again very overplayed.3. Our First Time: 2/5 The only wrong thing with this album. Its so sexed up and nasty, I don't like it very much.4. Runaway Baby: 5/5 Absolutely incredible, this is the most upbeat song on the album and its also one of my favorites.5. The Lazy Song: 5/5 This song is really funny, and a fun, easy listen.6. Marry You: 5/5 Yet another great song on the album, and nice upbeat tune with some mildly amusing lyrics. Just a nice song for the album.7. Talking to the Moon: 5/5 I didn't realize how awesome this song was until he performed it at the concert. The thing I love most about this song it the great hook to it.8. Liquor Store Blues: 4/5 It's alright, but not great. One of the weaker songs on the album. I9. Count on Me: 5/5 This is just a fun little happy song, the performance at the concert was great. I just like how happy it is.10. The Other Side: 5/5 This is hands down my favorite on the album, I don't care how awesome Grenade or Talking to the Moon were, but this song takes the cake.

{"text": "I'd never heard of Bruno until I saw him perform on SNL a few month ago. I was immediately taken by his looks, style and the two songs he sang (\"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Grenade\"). I bought this CD immediately and absolutely loved it! I was struck by how many different aspects of his personality the songs reveal (assuming they're at least somewhat autobiographical). In \"Grenade\" he's a bitter spurned lover, in \"Just the Way You Are\" he's an infatuated youth, in \"Our First Time\" he's a tentative, romantic lover, in \"Runaway Baby\" he's a cynical star who can have any girl he wants and throws them aside nightly. \"The Lazy Song\" makes me smile every time I hear it; it's an amusing, sexy take on lollygagging. The rest of the songs are equally good; there really isn't a klunker on the whole album. Bruno's voice is prolific and endearing; he may bring to mind Michael Jackson at times but his falsetto flourishes seem less artificial then Michael's. I can't wait for his next album.\n", "val": 0.03145495057106018}
{"text": "Wow. What can I say about this guy that would do him and his music justice? Admittedly, I didn't care for Just The Way You Are when it came out. That was the first time I had ever heard Bruno Mars. So much for first impressions. I mean, he sounds great in the song. It's just not my thing. Then I heard Billionaire and thought, \"This guy sounds great. But does he ever sing on his own?\"Then I heard Grenade. Easily one of the best songs I've heard in the past 10 years. I can't stop listening to it. I'll try and do a little synopsis of the rest:3. Our First Time: Slow, soulful song that has an 80s R&B feel to it. Great mood music for you and your baby. Bow chicka wow wow!  7/104. Runaway Baby: Funky beats. Rocking guitars. I defy you not to bob your head to this one. 8/105. Lazy Song: The best song Sublime never wrote. 7/106. Marry You: Another great song. I'm a straight male and I think I would even say yes to his proposal after this.  9/107. Talking To The Moon: My favorite song on the album, next to Grenade. Listening to this and Grenade back to back makes you realize some girl really did a number on this poor guy's heart. Beautiful song. 10/108. Liquor Store Blues: Very relaxed, reggae song featuring the awesome Damian Marley. If you have one rolled up, put this song on and light it up!  9/109. Count On Me: This song sounds more like a Jason Mraz song than all of the others on this album. Not a bad thing at all. You'll most likely listen to this song a few times in a row. 8/1010. The Other Side: This is my third favorite song and what I feel will represent how his next album will sound. It features Cee Lo Green and B.O.B, but Bruno clearly owns this song. 10/10As I said in the title, this guy will be around for a loooooong time. Michael Jackson (rest in peace) is gone. Say what you will about his personal life, that man had a powerful voice. The King of Pop is dead. Long live Bruno Mars.\n", "val": 0.016232583671808243}

{"text": "Having heard little bits of Hawaiian-born American singer Bruno Mars here and there on Youtube (enough to remember him), I saw this in the supermarket today and took a gamble on it. Glad I did! ... It's not my usual thing (I'm more into Ska, Rock and Indie), but I took an instant warm to \"Doo-Wops and Hooligans\".I suppose, given his LA/Hawaii roots, his musical style is somewhat understandable: from the first track, my room filled with an uplifting (and stylish) mixture of breezy, summery pop (lightly influenced by cool, urban reggae -- though it's more pop than anything). Bruno's soft (lightly falsetto) voice is perfectly matched with his cool-beats and Caribbean-toned music. It feels like you should be listening to this on a hammock with a glass of coconut juice and crashing waves beside you ))The songs are a blissful mixture of sunny romantic ballads and lazy chillout tracks. Personal highlights, are the addictive opener \"Grenade\" the appropriately titled (and infectiously inspirational) toe-tapper \"The Lazy Song\" (\"Today I don't feel like doing any-thing...\") and the moving \"Count on Me\". That said, though, there isn't any really any filler on the album: due to the style it's just perfect for kicking off your shoes and lying down with a of cuppa ))! My only (\"slight\") niggle, is that track 2 \"Just The Way You Are\" sounds very similar to Alicia Keys \"Doesn't Mean Anything\" (Element of Freedom). So close as to be little more than a complete rip-off!....(Search out the mashables online, they fit almost perfectly!)Quibble aside you can't really go wrong with this album.

Songs like \"The Other Side,\" \"Just the Way You Are,\" and \"Runaway Baby,\" make you want to sing right along with him. \"The Lazy Song,\" is a favorite of mine because it's totally down-to-earth and relatable. \"Liquor Store Blues,\" and his newest single, \"Grenade,\" also lend their own flavor to his album.

There are a select amount of artists who have such uniqeness like Keyshia Cole, Aretha Franklin, Tyrese, and Mary J Blige for example (off the top of my head). You know artists that you can identify just by their singin' voice. I think Bruno Mars is definitely one of those unique artists. What I love most is its actually him singin', no auto-tune, no enhancements. I just hope he doesn't become a victim of what they call fame. I've seen so many artists get completely destroyed by it.

{"text": "Bruno Mars has, almost overnight, become pretty recognizable in the music industry.  He's like the male equivalent of Nicki Minaj.  If you want a slick vocal to lace your chorus lines, you call Mars (just like if you want a catchy female rapper to spice up your remix you call Minaj).`Doo-Wops & Hooligans' marks Mars' solo effort.There is no denying that Bruno Mars has a beautifully toned voice.  His vocals are crisp and smooth and delightful to listen to.  From the show he made with select radio singles, Mars wet our appetite and got us hooked with his hooks.  We wanted to hear more.  Sadly, this debut album doesn't really deliver 100 percent.  In fact, it leaves a lot to be desired.It's kind of mediocre.In a nutshell, I still love `Just The Way You Are'; it's a beautiful yet simple take on love and I fell for it immediately.  `Grenade' almost feels like the dark side to the first single.  The construction is similar, just more intense.  I like the song, although I must admit that the lyrical content on the chorus can be a tad obvious, which I'm not really a fan of.  It's like `lyrics 101'; very amateur writing.  His conviction though, is very convincing.  `Count on Me' sounds like a Jason Mraz song.  It has a bouncy and catchy vibe.  It's a little cheesy in parts (well, almost all parts) but it will get you swaying to the beat and it's a sweet song.  I know that `Marry Me' is all sorts of ridiculous cheesiness, but I totally adore it.  Maybe it has something to do with the whole `Glee' take on it last week, but I just swallow that track up with nothing short of wholehearted affections.`Talking to the Moon' is a sweet ballad, but it lacks any real punch to make it wholly memorable.  His voice sounds great, but it doesn't `pop' aesthetically.  `The Lazy Song' is just stupid.  It isn't really funny or witty; it's just lazy and amateur.  I mean, aside from the sexual connotation, it seems like a children's song, like commercialized Smash Mouth.  To say I hate the song would be an understatement.  `Runaway Baby' is fun and stands out because of the audaciousness of it all.  It has a spunky and vibrant vibe, so I thoroughly enjoy it, even if the lyrics seem contradictory.I know `Our First Time' is supposed to be seductive and sexy but it's rather bland and boring.The vampire craze hit Mars, so he closed his album with `The Other Side' where he enlists the help of `it-man' Cee-Lo Green and that mediocre flash in the pan known as B.o. B. to help him spit a few verses about convincing some chick to convert to vampirism.  Um, it's a decent track when all is said and done.  It's catchy and stylish, but there is something missing from it.  `Liquor Store Blues' is just weird.  I mean, reggae is not something you just `mess' with.It just doesn't work.So, in the end the album is just kind of `meh'.  I mean, I like some of the songs and then I actually love two or three of them, but overall the feeling I get is one of being increasingly under-whelmed, so I can't say that I really recommend this album as a whole.Download `Marry Me' and `Just The Way You Are'.\n", "val": 0.008750565350055695}

{"text": "This is a great CD release effort by Bruno Mars, titled, \"Doo-Woops & Hooligans\". This great album opens with the solid track/gem \"Grenade\" : a soulful track with beautiful vocals & harmonies. This is my favourite track from this album. It signals the arrival of Bruno Mars with a 'bang' rather well. \"Just The Way You Are\" is another solid track/gem : a soul track with wonderful melody, harmonies & simple but yet effective lyrics. \"Our First Time\" is an okay/good reggae track. \"Liquor Store Blues\" is a great reggae track featuring the great reggae artist & producer, Damian Marley (great vocals). \"Runaway Baby\" is a rather poor pop 'racy' track. The interesting track, \"The Lazy Song\" : has great guitar chords & drums combination with beautiful matching vocals. Has simple beautiful but very effective/matching lyrics. \"Marry Me\" is a solid track/gem : a wonderful pop song, great 'racy' drumming with great high range vocals & lyrics are highly persuasive. \"Talking To The Moon\" is a laid-back track : great grand piano with matching vocals. \"Count On Me\" is a great pop song : great guitar & hand drums combinations with great vocals. The closing track, \"The Other Side\" is a good pop/hip hop/soul track featuring the talented Cee-Lo Green & B.o. B. (he rapping rather well). Their performance at the Grammy Awards 2011 was quite impressive & 'unusual' hairdo of the lead vocalist. On overall, this is an impressive CD release effort by Bruno Mars, a highly recommended CD listening.\n", "val": 0.048907168209552765}

I bought this on impulse hoping the rest of the album would be decent but I was seriously blown away. I've had this cd on repeat for weeks now. His voice is incredibly melodic and his lyrics are not bad either.Of course you have your hits that the public has already loved:Just the way you areand now they've begun playingGrenadegreat collaboration:The Other Side ft. Cee Lo Greengood lyrics:Count on meand those are probably my favorites on the whole album.

{"text": "After the spring and summer of Bruno Mars being on two huge hits, he has released his solo debut. I have to admit that I wasn't sure about ordering this disc. I am a professional DJ and very apprehensive about purchasing debut cds. I gave it a spin and I was very impressed! The Cd covers a few genres and is solid all the way through. He covers reggae, R&B, rock and pop. In my opinion he is in the running for artist of the year. My favorite tracks on the disc are \"The Lazy Song\" which is a great pop/ska song, \"Liquor Store Blues\" ft. Damian Marley, \"Marry You\", \"Runaway Baby\" and the closer \"The Other Side\" ft. Cee-Lo & B.o. B. None of the tracks are fillers. \"Our First Time\" is pure baby making music! That one ranks up there with Marvin Gaye and Barry White.

{"text": "Bruno Mars is a hit making machine!  After co-writing #1 hits for B.o. B. (\"Nothing on You\") and Travie McCoy (\"Billionaire\"), Bruno Mars released his first album last month and jumped into spotlight himself.  \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" is chock full of potential top ten hits and is a lot of fun, but will mostly appeal to the ladies.  This was probably the charming Mars' well thought out intention.Born in 1985, Mars' grew up in Hawaii in a musical family, surrounded by both pop and traditional hawaiian songs.  His music is mostly upbeat with hints of reggae and island folk music. His genre is a mix of R&B and Pop that is very \"in\" right now.  Mars has said that he was influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince and Elvis and you can hear traces of all three on the album.The album title \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" is meant to appeal to everyone.  There are doo- wop songs for the girls and hooligan songs for the boys.  The album is actually a lot more doo-wop than hooligan and even the hooligan songs aren't that rough.  This album was not meant to be a heavy, intense trip, but a light-hearted, fun journey.  It was a bit surprising that there were no rap or hip hop songs on the album, considering the performers he has been writing for.  However, the songs on this album do sound like the catchy, fun-to-sing songs \"Nothing on You\" and \"Billionaire.\"\"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" is mostly a collection of  feel-good, happy, love songs.  Mars' trademark falsetto voice and lively guitar playing does not disappoint.  The recurring theme is that Mars falls hopelessly in love and is not afraid to let it show.  Mars likes to make girls feel special and appreciated.  Any girl would want to be Mars' girlfriend and probably will buy the album for the way it makes them feel.  \"Just the Way You Are\" is the #1 song in the country right now and \"Grenade\" is in the top ten.  The lyrics in \"Grenade\" are overly dramatic (I would go through all this pain/Take a bullet straight through my brain/Yes, I would die for ya baby),  but the rhythm keeps it from being taken too seriously.  In \"Marry You\" Mars adds chiming church bells and makes it sound like an old Motown song, but it is fun and every girl probably wishes her boyfriend would sing this song to her.  In \"Our First Time\" Mars pours out a  romantic ballad.  Guys will enjoy listening to this song with their girlfriends.  \"Count on Me\" is a catchy folk tune (\"You can count on me/Like one, two, three\") that sounds like he's strumming a yukele and you can hear his island influence.  The song is easy to remember and sing along with and will probably be the next big hit.  The hooligan song \"Runaway Baby\" is the most fast paced with a kick to it, but still doesn't come off as a hooligan hit.  \"Talking to the Moon\" is the darkest of the songs with very haunting vocals and melody.  It is a depressing song and seems out of place with the rest of the happy songs, but shows Mars' vunerable side.  A favorite is \"The Lazy Song\" which has a great beat and fun message for guys who like to think \"I'll just strut in my birthday suit/And let everything just hang loose.\"  \"Liquor Store Blues\" has a great beat and talks about some stress Mars is dealing with, but it doesn't come off too serious.  There is a strong reggae influence on this song.  Bob Marley's son, Damian Marley, makes an appearance giving the album an extra bonus.  Bruno saves the best for last with \"The Other Side.\" This song is by far the best hooligan song, featuring Cee Lo and B.o. B.  You can hear Michael Jackson's influence from the first beat.  The song and lyrics gives us an idea of the \"other side\" of Mars (\"and quite frankly I've been going insane in between my eyes/I really can't explain what I feel inside/If you knew what I was, you'd run and hide\").Overall, this is an easy to listen to and enjoyable album that should sell very well.  For this album, it seems his goal was to score as many #1 hits as he could, get lots of radio play and lots of female fans.  At times, the album teeters on the verge of being sappy and corny, but Bruno's recent cocaine possession arrest may have helped give his wholesome personality and reputation more street edge.  Some people think this was a planned stunt to bring out the hooligan side of Mars that doesn't make a full appearance on the album. This was probably another well thought out intention.  The music industry thinks the arrest should do little damage to his promising career.\n", "val": 0.013671350665390491}

{"text": "Bruno Mars literally sprung up out of nowhere this year when he appeared on B.O.B.'s hit single Nothin On You.  He had an undeniably smooth voice with a unique quality that made him instantly likable.  I will admit that Bruno Mars does show flashes of Michael Jackson in his voice in the same type of way that Ne-Yo has some shades of MJ in his voice.  This is not to say he sings or sounds like Michael, just that certain notes he hits reminds of the late great.  However that little quality did not cause me to overrate this album.  Bruno Mars is extremely talented and is a star waiting to happen.Having also appeared on Travie McCoy's successful single Billionaire as well as helping produce the magnificent Cee-Lo Green single \"F You\", Bruno finally drops his much anticipated album.  Earlier he released a 4 song EP \"Its Better If You Don't Understand\" which was a great record.  However, 3 of those 4 songs made it to his debut album Doo Wops & Hooligans.  That would not be so bad if the album was longer than 10 tracks.  It's still not really a problem since the album is filled with great songs.  The single Just The Way You Are is 5 stars all the way as well as Grenade, Talking To The Moon and Lazy Song.  Bruno Mars mixes soul with reggae and pop but does so effortlessly and with such style and grace.  Vocally he's one of the best male singers to emerge in quite a while and the production is timeless.  The lyrics are original and sung with passion. Cee-Lo Green, B.O.B., and Damian Marley make cameos but Bruno was not outshined on his own project.Doo Wops & Hooligans is easily one of the better albums of the year.  I'd rank it up there with Janelle Monae, Nneka, and Corinne Bailey Rae's efforts.  It's unfortunate that Bruno Mars has encountered a bit of trouble as this album was released but it's easy to see he has the talent to be a cornerstone in music for years to come. 5 stars.\n", "val": 0.02505546249449253}

Mars' music reminds of India Irie because his lyrics are honest, well thought out and rythmic.The only downside I found was that the CD only has 10 songs.

{"text": "Bruno Mars certainly had one of the more anticipated debut albums of 2010.  After superb turns with other artists (\"Nothin' On You\" with B.o. B and \"Billionaire\" with Travie McCoy), Mars struck out on his own with his solo #1 hit, \"Just the Way You Are.\" Mars's debut is not as perfect as the Billy Joel lifted title, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Doo-Wops-Hooligans/dp/B003ZJ0ZX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Doo - Wops & Hooligans</a>&nbsp;possesses more than enough solid moments over it short ten tracks at thirty-five minutes total to be both enjoyable and promising for Mars's future.  Hopefully, Doo-Wops & Hooligans strikes more a chord than some recent albums by debut artists, namely the dismal selling, though enjoyable<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/31-Minutes-to-Takeoff/dp/B003R4JB56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">31 Minutes to Takeoff</a>&nbsp;by soulful pop singer Mike Posner.  Additionally, let's hope his recent run-in with the law (a felony) does not degrade a promising career.\"Grenade\" opens the album off a bit oddly, finding Mars contrasting his usually polished, lazy vocals with more overt, forced vocals.  \"Grenade\" sounds the slightest bit clunky at times and does not represent Mars as the crooner that we've (the listeners) have come to know him as.  He has some nice vocal moments, achieving some soulful grit that listeners have also desired to hear, but he overdoes the nuances vocally.  \"Grenade\" does grow on you after a couple of listens, but despite its sound production work, it is eclipsed by much better cuts from 'Doo-Wops & Hooligans.' Think of \"Grenade\" as a bit of `false-start.'\"Just The Way You Are\" atones for any questions of Mars's credibility that may be raised from the left-field \"Grenade.\" Here the songwriting is much better executed and the production work is simple, yet beautiful and captivating.  \"Just the Way You Are\" is the valedictory cut by all means, accentuated by a schmaltzy, yet sincere refrain: \"when I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change, cause you're amazing, just the way you are...\"  \"Our First Time\" rivals the greatness of \"Just the Way You Are,\" only missing its superbness by a few short notches.  Initially, the reggae-tinged cut may be a bit `off-putting,' but quickly one feels the lazy vibe suits Mars perfectly.  Again, the songwriting is strong with another catchy, though not revolutionary hook (\"just go wit it... and I will go real slow wit it... it's our first time\").  But let's face it, the charm of Mars's vocal makes up for the corniness right?\"Runaway Baby\" is like \"Grenade\" in the sense that it is a bit awkward.  Mars thrives on lazier cuts as opposed to up-tempo numbers that degrade his vocal polish slightly.  But he once again atones for this with a the enjoyable and lyrically relevant \"Lazy Song\" which finds  Mars referencing the rap song \"Teach Me How To Dougie,\" among other absurdities.  \"Lazy Song\" is enjoyable because of Mars' consummate pop culture references and `stream of consciousness' approach in addition to it brief 3:20 length.\"Marry You\" is solid, though it sounds similar in conception and sound to \"Just the Way You Are,\" lifting the underlying progression.  Despite this, the production is clever, the drums are big sounding quoting the 1980s, and the corny `wedding bells' are actually a clever addition.  \"Talking to the Moon\" slows the tempo once more, showing off the beauty of Mars's vocals.  The production is solid and while \"Talking to the Moon\" also sounds similar to previous cuts (namely the progression is similar to \"Billionaire\"), Mars pulls it off incredibly well.  It is another nice addition to the track list.\"Liquor Store Blues,\" featuring Damian Marley is as enjoyable as everything else here.  Again, Mars favors a reggae-tinged approach, but it bodes well for him.  The hook is clever once again: \"one shot for my pain, one drag for my sorrow, get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.\"  Marley is surprisingly tamer than usual here, not stealing Mars's thunder in the least.  \"Count On Me\" finds Mars sounding like a mix between Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson; the cut itself channels recent Plain White T's hit single \"1,2,3,4\".  There is nothing monumental here, but some smart choices are made to omit drums from the production work and add nice, lush strings.  Closing cut \"The Other Side,\" featuring Cee-Lo Green and B.o. B is another standout, and the perfect choice to close this effort.  It is uptempo, but Mars sounds better than previous uptempo cuts, though it may be Cee-Lo Green that steals the show.  B.o. B.'s verse is strong, additionally.Overall, this is a solid debut album on all accounts.  It is short, but given the fact that Mars' relies on lazy grooves for his best vocal performances, the short length bodes in his favor;  a longer album would have knocked the quality down a notch most likely.  Vocally, there is room for more maturity for Mars, but if given the chance, I think that we as the listeners can expect it on his NEXT album.  Strong debut; 3 1/2 stars\n", "val": 0.004156242590397596}

{"text": "Using a hook singer to push a single is nothing new in the hip hop genre, some time the results are successful, such  as the classic Ghostface Killah & Carl Thomas song Never Be The Same of disastrous  the Lloyd Banks & Musiq Soulchild track Addicted from Bank's second album . Last spring  rising hip hop artist  B.O.B. had a smash hit with the Bruno Mars assisted Nothing On You from B.O.B., Mars followed up that song with a equally successful single the Travie McCoy late summer hit Billionaire. On the heels of a possible jail sentence, we now have Bruno Mars debut album. Unlike hook singers Bruno decided to release his album while the iron was hot.1. Grenade - This is a rock influenced song where Bruno's vocals seem to go with beat very naturally. Mr. Mars even sings some of the riffs similar to the late MJ. *** out of ****2. Just The Way You Are - The lead single which is straight bubble gum pop. I'm a grown man so this song didn't really appeal to me but once again the vocals are good. *** out of ****3. Our First Time - I was waiting for a slow jam from Mr. Mars and this is one of the few on the CD. The arrangement reminds me of something that Robin Thicke would do. **** out of ****.4. Runaway Baby - As I soon as I heard the production on the song, I knew I wouldn't like it. Bruno gives one of his worst vocals on this track and it sounds like something Ricky Martin would have done back in 1999. * out of ****.5. The Lazy Song - Listening to this track, I got the feeling Bruno just wanted to have a humorous song on his disc. Just as the title implies this is a lazy song. ** out of ****.6. Marry You - I'm not really a rock fan but while listening to this song I did find myself tapping my feet and I could easily see this song being sung on an episode of Glee in a Will & Emma fantasy sequence. *** out of ****7. Talking To The Moon - Finally we have a track on par with Our First Time. I could easily relate to the message in the song about being away from a loved one.8. Liquor Store Blues (Feat. Damian Marley) - The production on this track was a little weak but the Damian Marley cameo saves it. *** out of ****.9. Count On Me - Count Of Me is a folk inspired ballad similar to something Jason Marz might be. If he doesn't go to jail and with a great band backing him, this song will sound great live. ****10. The Other Side (Feat Cee Lo Green & B.o. B) - The last song on the album gets some cool points since it's refreshing just to hear Cee Lo sing. *** out of ****Overall this isn't a horrible debut album, it is a mediocre album.  I thought for sure that Bruno would go for a straight R&B album with top notch production, instead he's given us a Jason Marz sounding album.  Bruno has a naturally smooth falsetto voice and while he couldn't handle to other falsetto's singers like El Debarge or Ralph Tresvant, the weak production on this disc hurts Bruno more than it helps. Given that Bruno is a fan of doo-wop I have to wonder why he didn't enlist the production of Raphael Saadiq who had an amazing album with the Motown inspired The Way I See It . If Bruno wants to have a longer career in the music industry he'll need to come a little stronger next time or his career could end up like Nate Dogg's.\n", "val": 0.0005286718369461596}

On Doo-Wops and Hooligans, Bruno shows the world not only his incredible vocal range but the strength of his song-writting and versatility as a muscian. He plays most of the instruments himself.The result: Ten great songs with at least three sure fire hit singles. Those being the current r'n'b flavored hit \"Just the Way you are\", \"Grenade\" (his latest release) and \"Count on Me.\" There are even two collaborations.

Why not have included \"Somewhere in Brookyn\" or even a second remix of \"Just the Way you are\"?UPDATE: Since my initial review Amazon now sells the SPECIAL EDITION CD which is called the Oz or Australian Tour version. It contains the same bonus tracks featured on the Japan-only release.Here you have all 10 of the original tracks plus the following 6 bonus ones. These being:1- Just the way you are (remix ft. Lupe Fiasco)2- Somewhere in Brooklyn (previously only available as a digital download)3- Talking to the moon (acoustic piano version)4 - Just the way you are (Walmart Soundcheck version that was recorded in front of a select audience in Las Vegas)5 - Grenade (Walmart Soundtrack version also from Las Vegas)6 - The other side (Walmart Soundtrack version live from Las Vegas)The live tracks illustrate just what a talented singer and band Bruno has and will bring a great smile to you upon listening to them. I know that the price is a bit steep but for you diehards this is the definitive version of Bruno's multi-platinum debut album!I can hardly wait for his latest single \"It will rain\" that is slated to be on the Twillight's Breaking Dawn soundtrack slated for release this November.\n", "val": 0.0071455324068665504}

Now I'm not sure if that's true or not (I'll have to go back and give it a more detailed listen), but it's notable for its good vibes and upbeat feel without all of the nonsense that's been pervading rap and hip-hop these last few years.The entire album is eminently listenable, fun, light, and upbeat (even what should be a somewhat mean-spirited Bad Day), something rare in hip-hop these days.  As \"Chiddy\" Anamege says in Opposite of Adults, \"I got a flow that makes the girls do a cartwheel\" -- indeed, to my ears, his rhythmic flow is as good if not better than even that of Lupe Fiasco (my previous benchmark).  Some of the lyrics are pretty clever and his word play is top notch.  The tracks, like the lyrics, are well layered by \"Xaphoon\" Beresin (the \"Bang\" part of Chiddy Bang?)I'm surprised that this album doesn't have more reviews; there's not a single bad track on the album and it's definitely worth the price of admission.\n", "val": 0.0336897186934948}

{"text": "When I first heard about this song, I thought it was simply a gimmick by the band to score points with the comic-book-nerd crowd, or a goofy fan project by the band.  Why else would someone make a song about Superman, of all things?  Not that a song about a comic-book character can't be good -- it just seemed like a weird concept to me.  So when I finally heard the song on the radio, I was rather shocked.  Rather than being the goofy novelty song I was expecting, it turned out to be wistful and even sad.  Was I even listening to the right song?Now I've fallen in love with the song, and it's introduced me to other fantastic numbers by Five For Fighting.  Though \"Superman\" will always be my favorite song of theirs.\"Superman (It's Not Easy)\" never refers to the titular hero by name in its lyrics, but its references are quite obvious -- it paraphrases the infamous \"It's a bird!  It's a plane!\" catchphrase in \"I'm more than a bird/I'm more than a plane,\" and makes references to \"a silly red sheet\" and \"digging for Kryptonite on this one-way street.\"  And it takes what has long been a heroic but flat character and gives him a more tragic side, showing how difficult it is to be a hero, and reminisces about how even an icon such as the Man of Steel has his own dreams, fears, and grief, and \"even heroes have the right to bleed.\"  One can easily apply this \"darker side\" to other classic heroes and figures, of course, but naturally this song is Superman's only.The music is quite lovely as well, a wistful guitar and piano number that's never intense but always thoughtful and contemplative, with John Ondrasik providing vocals that are heartfelt but never over-the-top.  Drums are used at points of the song, but they're very understated and never overtake the music.This is a lovely number I'd recommend to everybody, but is especially poignant to the comic-book fan who is familiar with Superman and wants to see another side to the Man of Steel.  Even heroes, after all, have the right to bleed, dream, and cry.\n", "val": 0.001111356308683753}

I will always remember him, with the voice of a young boy of 12, singing this song for my parents. He was too shy to play it in front of my large extended family so he played it just for them in their bedroom. He didn't know that the rest of the family was being very quiet so they could hear him. His father and I were going through a divorce, and as the oldest boy, close to both of us, he was hit hardest by that awful experience.

{"text": "I discovered Delain by accident, but I was intrigued that it was started by Martijn Westerholt, the brother of Within Temptation co-founder Robert Westerholt. I'm definitely getting some WT vibes from it, which I happen to love, so that's good. But the truly refreshing part of Delain, besides the phenomenal and rockin' composition, is the voice of Charlotte Wessels. It's completely pleasing to listen to, but it is as fully capable of being powerful as it is being beautiful. Her range is effortlessly wide, though she never veers into the \"opera\" territory that is so widely used in the symphonic metal territory. There are many guest musicians on here, and it was a pleasant surprise to hear so many familiar voices. This debut album of Delain's is in my opinion, practically perfect.1. \"Sever\" - An amazing opener to this incredible album. It starts off with an orchestral intro, then the inimitable Charlotte Wessels enters, followed by Marco Hiatala of Nightwish and a fantastically epic choir.2. \"Frozen\" - The first single; it begins with some haunting bells, and then the guitars enter. The chorus is extremely catchy, with a continuous \"answer me\" getting stuck in one's head. The choir provides a stunningly beautiful bridge, followed by a stand-out guitar solo.3. \"Silhouette of a Dancer\" - This one scared the heck out of me the first time I listened to it, but now I think it rocks. I was taken aback by the intensely sinister vocals of George Oosthoek, who growls menacingly yet adeptly opposite Charlotte's vocals. Not to be missed!4. \"No Compliance\" - This song is entirely sung by Sharon den Adel of Within Temptation and Marco. It's pretty dark, and I think it's slowly growing on me. Initially I wasn't too sure what to make of it, because my first listen didn't really meet my expectations. I was willing to give it a chance, though, and it is a rather good song, just perhaps not as strong as others on the album.5. \"See Me in Shadow\" - Second single; Liv Kristine of Leaves' Eyes accompanies Charlotte, and her light vocals help make the song as melancholy and achingly beautiful as it is.6. \"Shattered\" - This song features Charlotte creating beautiful backing vocals for the choruses. It is very energetic and catchy, and would probably be a great song to listen to while working out.7. \"The Gathering\" - I cannot get this song out of my head; it's absolutely infectious. Marco's voice blends so well with Charlotte's in this one, and the whole atmosphere seems almost like folk music.8. \"Daylight Lucidity\" - Charlotte creates some gorgeous harmonies with herself in the chorus, then Marco and the epic choir join in once again.9. \"Sleepwalker's Dream\" - My personal favorite, and the song that got me hooked onto Delain. The intro features some fantastic orchestral work, and then leads into an energetic chorus that features Charlotte reaching some stunningly beautiful and crystal-pure high notes. I never get tired of hearing them.10. \"Day for Ghosts\" - Marco and Liv Kristine once again take charge for this song. It begins with a creepy piano solo that escalates into a burst of overwhelming orchestral and vocal glory. The intensity doesn't let up either, as the choir joins in to echo the vocal lines of Liv.11.\"Pristine\" - The stunning finale. It's epic with the choir, haunting with the instrumentation, creepy with Oosthoek's voice returning, and beautiful with Charlotte's voice and harmonies.12. \"(Deep) Frozen\" (Bonus track) - This seems to be a sister song to \"Frozen,\" or at least an alternative version. Oosthoek is here once again on the choruses, creating a much more sinister tone than its counterpart. Yet, this recycled material still manages to seem original, which can only be attributed to Delain's brilliant musicianship.Adding this masterpiece of an album to your collection is sure to leave you more than satisfied. You won't be disappointed!\n", "val": 0.022915923967957497}
{"text": "I discovered Delain one day when I was looking up more information on Within Temptation and it's band members. I discovered that Martijn Westerholt had suffered from Pfeiffer's Disease and thus had to leave Within Temptation in 2001 but that he had preservered and started his own band called Delain in 2002. I decided to look up this band. I found their official site where I was able to hear what they had to offer. It was very good so I got my hands on their first full length album, Lucidity.I love the music on this album. I'm a fan of symphonic metal and Lucidity is a very beautiful album. It has the beautiful guitars that I love so dearly, bass, drums, keyboards, *Deep Sigh* It's very rare, in my experience, to find a relatively new band that plays very well together. The vocals of Charlotte Wessels are unique and interesting. In a world where most of the female fronted bands have high soprano singers, Charlotte is refreshing with her serene yet spunky (poppy) sound. I recommend Delain for those who like Symphonic Metal but want a change of pace from the lovely high soprano vocalists. I also recommend they check out Delain's official website or look for them at My Space and listen to what the band has to offer before they decide to buy this item!\n", "val": 0.0374976210296154}

Delain has becomes a favorite in the US as well as concerts are booked solid and concert goers are every familiar with their songs.

{"text": "Lucidity is Dutch symphonic rock band Delain's debut album, that brings a wonderful, emotional new sound to the genre, powerful by the fabulous, unique vocals of Charlotte Wessels and the former keyboardist of Within Temptation (and brother of WT founder/guitarist Robert Westerholt), Martijn Westholt. Originally founded to be a studio project heavy with guest musicians, Delain's Lucidity album proved so popular that fans called for live shows, so Delain transformed into a touring act and, on their second album, April Rain, their sound changed accordingly. This has led to an interesting (and unexpected) difference between the two albums, particularly in the overall sound.Lucidity has a darker, grittier feel, with less musically complex songs (that just seem much cleaner than some of the over-produced stuff on April Rain) that have more emotion behind them. Though Charlotte's voice isn't as polished here as on April Rain, she still sounds amazing, and the numerous guest appearances from some of the biggest names on the European metal scene really pumped with album with awesome. Some of the guests include Sharon den Adel (Within Temptation), Marco Hietala (Nightwish), Liv Kristine (Leaves Eyes) and George Oosthoek.The undisputed stand-out song here is \"The Gathering\" (I've never seen the movie, but I'm pretty sure the entire song is just a Highlander reference), which marries of voices of Charlotte Wessels, Marco Hietala and Guus Eikens in a epic and catchy tune that will make you want to pump your fists in the air and jump. I also really enjoyed \"Sever,\" with its excellent orchestral sections, \"Daylight Lucidity's\" fresh and melodic approach.Vocally, \"Sleepwalker's Dream\" really shows off Charlotte's abilities and strength, and showcases her as a versatile singer who can sing operatic-style parts, as well as rock ones. But if you're looking for a song that will really stick with you purely based on the vocals, I'd go for \"Silhouette of a Dancer.\" While I know there are bands out there who really specialize in beauty and the beast style vocals, I really think that this song is the best I've ever heard this type of vocal work done, between Charlotte's innocent, almost girlishly high vocals and George Oosthoek's deep growls, I think Delain really found the heart of what this type of vocal work is about.Now, I can't talk about this album without mentioning Sharon den Adel's surprising vocal performance on \"No Compliance\" (the U.S. version of Lucidity includes a version of this song with Charlotte performing the vocal), Liv Kristine's haunting vocals on \"A Day for Ghosts\" and \"See Me in Shadow\" which will send chills down your spine.What surprises me the most about this album is that I tend to enjoy it more than April Rain, even though it's the bands first album. It's hard to explain why, but Lucidity is darker, heavier, more emotional, more personal and just feels like it has more heart than April Rain. Lucidity also just seems cleaner to me, as some songs on April Rain seem over-produced, and it just seems to have a higher quality of guitar work and the epic metal sound.If you've listened to April Rain, I'd definitely recommend Lucidity -and if you thought April Rain was too light for your tastes, you may want to check out Lucidity, you might be surprised.\n", "val": 0.042940713465213776}

I already deleted those three songs off of my MP3 player and I hope that there is not anymore of that from this band in the future.Overall the songs are very well written, the instruments are played masterfully and are not over the top or speed metal. This is truly beautiful songs, all sung in a soulful and melodic voice that blends well with the music. This album was an easy 4 out of 5 stars. If it would not have had that gutteral growling garbage on the 3 songs I would have gave it a 5/5.I will still be purchasing \"April Rain\" also.

It's OK, but doesn't live up to the 5-star rating others have given it.Charlotte Wessels has a truly stunning voice and is the lead on most of the songs.  Unfortunately, in too many of the songs her voice simply didn't come through as clearly as it could have.  When your lead singer (on most of the songs) has a fantastic voice like this highly talented young lady you definitely want to highlight it as much as possible.  Let Charolette's talent shine to the fullest extent!\"See me in Shadow\" was her strongest song -- and the one where one could best hear her exceptional vocal skill.  I appreciate songs where you can easily make out the words without having to read what the lyrics are supposed to be.I guess I'm simply not a fan of symphonic metal where they, for reasons that elude me, feel forced to toss in a distorted male voice.

{"text": "Thank you Mr. Joss reviewer. I bought this CD as a result of your own detailed review. At first I was quite disappointed and then found myself wanting to listen to it more often. Though others have compared this artist to pop (I did so myself at first, probably because I was listening to lot of Tristania during that week), I have become to realize that this is actually a complex band, with a lot of maturity if considering they have only been together few years. They are exciting and willing to experiment. Vocals are finally clean enough where one can enjoy, have fun with(and understand) them, yet there is the right touch of grunts and harsh male vocals as well when needed. I have over 50 CDs now of symphonic and goth metal music(female fronted) and from having listened to those and hundreds more of tracks and videos on youtube and lastfm, it is my opinion that this is not a \"wanna be\" imitation of a band. I believe that one must stop using Nightwish or Epica or WT as the rule by which all are judged. There are many talented bands (other than those giants that initially, most likely, introduced many of us to this genre - and Evanescence being one of them, sorry but I had to give them tribute) working to develop their unique sound, and this band is one of them. It may require \"a few listen\" to fully appreciate the complexity of the harmonics/vocals, but I am going to give it another shot and buy the next CD as well. If they can pull it through without going the electro/pop/techno route, then they should be able to find their place in the ever so crowded Dutch and Scandinavian music scene. And there is nothing wrong in having one or two CDs that on the surface may appear less intense, is there? Being a big fan of lyrics, I can say that this album has some beautiful ones and that some bands that may profess to be much \"doomier\" have much less gothic rhymes.

Cube is graced with some great verses from the reliable WC on \"Life In California\" and \"Too West Coast\", both of which are also standouts. \"I Rep That West\", \"Drink The Kool-Aid\", and the fiery \"No Country For Young Men\" round out the must haves for the disc. Tracks to avoid at all costs are \"It Is What It Is\", \"All Day Everyday\" and \"Fat Cat\", all of which are repetitive garbage.

All in all, it is a very good album, but as one reviewer said, if you are looking for AMW, Death Certificate or The Predator, this is not it.

So far only Hood Robbin, and Nothing Like LA, and I rep that west has my attention.  The others tracks left me skipping through quickly.  In fairness, I need to give a few more listens and let it marinate, but I will say it does not come close to Raw Footage or Laugh Now and Cry Later at this point.  Ill update my review after a week with my final thoughts.Whoever the producers were on Raw Footage, keep them.

{"text": "Now I'ma start off by saying THIS IS NOT OLD CUBE! So don't go in thinking it is. Yea it has its moments where it has that old school feel, but it's definitely not all the way through.Ok now that that's out of the way let me say this is a very strong album from Cube. Now all the great legends have either passed away, matured, evolved, or just gotten plain crappy (Snoop) but I feel Cube is still trying to hold his own. He wants this to be like his older material, but that's not possible because everything has changed. There are some tracks that are ehh.... (She Couldn't Make it On Her Own) and then there are some that are like DAMN! (Hood Robbin). Then you have tracks where the beats are bangin' and some where it just doesn't seem like Cube should even be spittin' over it. But over all this is a solid album. The tracks fit together nicely and I don't find the need to skip any tracks because even the sub-par one's are a nice lil change of direction vibe-wise.So if you're a Cube fan then check this out, if not then still give it a chance. Just don't go in preparing to hear \"Death Certificate\" or \"Lethal Injection\" or any of that stuff because YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!P.S. As of now the track listing is wrong on Amazon.

He has his sons on a few who are good rappers,but unfortunately for me he has wc on a few too who i think is garbage now(i thought he was good when he was maad circle but his modern raps he seems to always do a mad shouting high pitched rhyme thing where he talks garbage).While he isn't dropping provocative rhymes he is just having fun-cementing his rep as the best in the west-lounging at the top-why not?He still can put down some of the best gangsta tracks you will ever hear\"too west coast\" is my pick-but there are others on this too.He still has some killer rhymes\"i'm the real iron man-you just robert downey//a crackhead and blackface straight out the county\".The actor Keith David still does some voicework on songs here too(thats been like the past 5 albums lol).Just the way he closes out a song\"The grand wizard...Ice cube\"-just showing that no one can topple him after all these years.For people complaining it's not the same Ice Cube,the rap game has evolved,peoples life circumstances change-he tells you himself he does this for his kids. When i buy cube im not expecting another death certificate or predator,but i enjoy this album just as much,its his best since predator.Ice Cube is a legend and this album shows he still makes the tightest quality albums around-besides the game who else is going to drop an album of this quality?It's hard to believe it came out last october-it still sounds so fresh to me and ive played it a lot-100 percent buy it.\n", "val": 0.022641370072960854}

{"text": "I remember, years ago -- the early 90s, I think -- reading a review of a Paul McCartney or George Harrison cd. And the writer started off with this: \"Every couple of years, another ex-Beatle releases a new solo album. And for fans of the Beatles our feelings take that same roller coaster ride: First, there's the anticipation (which is the best part), then there comes that first track on the album or cd which is usually quite good, and then the inevitable disappointment upon listening to the rest of the disc, followed by the sad realization that this is it. There will be no return to Strawberry Fields or Penny Lane.\"I feel the same way about 90s hip-hop. That incredible era from 1988-1993 (Cube, 2Pac, Onyx, Boss, Snoop, Cypress, EPMD, KRS-One, Ice-T, Tribe, Too Short and the mighty PE) gave us a high-water mark that has not been touched by rap since, and probably never will. But we are now almost 20 years removed from that day and age.Every time a new album arrives from one of those hip-hop heavyweights I just mentioned I think the same thing. There's usually a few good bangers on each cd but otherwise, it's just not the same.I feel the same way about I Am The West. It's OK, but it lacks the urgency of Cube's best. And it's not his fault - how can we expect him or anyone else to ever top that incredible run he had in the early 90s with Straight Outta Compton, Amerikkka's Most Wanted, Death Certificate and the Predator ? Any one of those discs is enough to catapault a rapper into the Hip Hop Hall of Fame. Thrown in Guerrillas in the Mist, the Kill At Will EP and the inconsistent Lethal Injection and you have one arguably the greatest discographies in rap.But it's not 1992 anymore. Cube is a multi-millionaire several times over and there's a Black President in the White House. The anger that fueled those albums just can't be conjured up so easily anymore.To his credit he's not phoning his performance in. ('**cough, coughJIGGAcough*) ) He's still a lion on the mic, but there's nothing very compelling here other than partying and celebrating living in California.Buy it and enjoy it on it's own terms, but don't pretend that it's a regurgitation of 1992, because it's not. The only way to really relive those days is to pop The Chronic in your cd player and let it roll.\n", "val": 0.00021255672618281096}

Since \"Amerikkka's Most Wanted,\" I've purchased every Ice Cube album (even \"Bootlegs & B-Sides\") on or within days of their release dates.I'm sad to report that this CD is almost entirely forgettable, and continues his recent trend of throwing together a set of songs that contain mediocre rhymes, virtually meaningless lyrics (i.e., mostly boasting about how fantastic he is, without doing anything to prove he's still got the skills he had in the 1990s), unimpressive music, and hooks/refrains that are way, way beneath the level of creativity that we all know Ice Cube is capable of producing.I won't be purchasing his next CD on its release date.  Instead, I will apply the same kind of scrutiny that I now apply to other artists -- by listening to sample tracks and purchasing only those which are well-reviewed and actually worth my money.In other words, this release marks the end of my blind allegiance to any CD Ice Cube produces.

{"text": "This is an unexpected treat - the lyrical and melodic collaborations of Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia expressed one of the greatest creative, synergistic, partnerships in musical history, and - this collection of their songs sounds just like I imagine the two of them wanted them to (so easy to imagine Jerry pickin' away with McReynolds, Nelson and Allen, gladly taking a back seat with a big smile on his face)! I've heard others play the songs of Garcia and Hunter, but this sounds really fresh and varied, a real tribute to the originals, and not just a collection of covers.I can't get enough of it, as it is faithful to the feel of the originals, but fills them out even more with excellent musicianship (GD sounding alt-country-rock/bluegrass), and heartfelt dust-covered vocals (mostly from Jesse McReynolds, but also a couple of good ones from David Nelson, and Stu Allen - sounding like he's channeling Garcia on Deal!). Also includes a new Hunter/McReynold's collaboration, Day By Day.This collection should be really popular with Robert Hunter/Grateful Dead/Jerry Garcia Band/Old And In The Way/Garcia & Grisman/New Riders of the Purple Sage fans, as well as some who have never heard of these bands....\n", "val": 0.07844169437885284}

{"text": "I saw Jesse McReynolds as part of Blue Grass Night at the Georgia Mountain Fair in Hiawassee, GA. During his set, he started talking about a song that he had just played. He then said, \"You never know what we are going to play, We might even do a tribute album to Garcia Hunter tunes.\" He then turned to one of the younger members of the band and asked if he wanted to play one. They then went into a very nice cover of Black Muddy River with some nice mandolin and fiddle work. After the show I asked them if they were truly working on such a project and they said yes. When I needed to make an additional purchase to get the free shipping, I looked up this album and added it to my cart. (sort of a Christmas Present to myself)The CD is very nicely done and the song selections are pretty good. Would have liked to seen New Speedway Boogie done as a Bluegrass tune. Ultimately, it came across as more of a cover album rather than a bluegrass album. Some of the covers were done very well with really good mandolin, banjo and fiddle, but some of the other covers were a little more electric and didn't have the same energy. I am thinking that Mr. McReynolds was giving in to the yearnings of some of his younger band mates. The band is made up of family from grand children and spouses.I am glad I bought the CD and I think this Bluegrass Legend did a fine job of covering Garcia Hunter.

{"text": "This CD was a real treat I received in the mail today. Jesse McReynolds and his brother Jim played in a bluegrass band that Jerry Garcia loved in the 60s and He would drive around the southern Bluegrass festivals of Alabama ,Virginia looking for his favorite groups. The wheel of life is so strange at times, He did meet Jesse and the group, but just got an autograph.Forward to the 90's and Jesse finds out about Jerry and the Grateful Dead and his second wife Joy is a Dead fan. One thing leads to another and he is together with David Nelson of the New Riders, and Stu Allen of The JGB and others of Jesse's group. They put together a twelve set song list of Dead songs , plus a new song \"Day by Day\" written by Hunter and McReynolds.Jerry Garcia would have loved this, Jesse really puts his soul into this and he comes across like someone who has known this music all of his life. His vocals and mandolin embrace the songs of Garcia and Hunter like no one else could. Plus having Stu Allen and David Nelson on guitar, there is some very Garcia like licks. He sings \"Stella Blue\" like He had lived the song and the music is so pretty with incredible pedal steel. This is not like a tribute album where someone rips thru the melodies, This guy lives them, having been very familiar with the Grateful Dead for over a Decade now. His version of \"Deep Elem Blues\" really bounces along a lot like Jerry would. Robert Hunter said \"Jesse's singing voice is like a long-lost brother voice between Jerry Garcia and David Nelson.\"I love Jesse doing \"Deal\", sounds great. It sounds alot like Jerry's original. The mandolin is sweet. Plus a great telecaster solo.His version of \"Ripple\" is poetry in motion.His song with Robert Hunter is an original called \"Day By Day\" which is a mid tempo song with real melodic mandolin and guitar, and the words are simple truths of life. Hunter really seemed to enjoy the song they wrote together.The CD starts out with \"Black Muddy River\", Jesse seems real comfortable with this and his mandolin is great here, he really has a very recognizable style, all his own. His version of \"Franklin's Tower\" has a country feel to it. Please let me try to get this across, This has a real old timey traditional bluegrass sound, but is a great recording. I have to see what else this man has available in recordings.To hear a bluegrass icon sing Grateful Dead songs written by a man (Jerry Garcia) who idolized him is a miracle.

There is a generous amount of solo time for the sidemen.  The best feature of the music is the voice.  Miss Davis has a subtle way of bending a note and using a gentle vibrato to put some great texture into the melodies.

It's so much more then I expected. Everytime I listen to it I feel as though my soul is singing along with Paul. He is one of those vocalist that doesn't just sing about God & Jesus he sings TO God & Jesus. It's no wonder God answered the prayer for rain while he was on tour in Isreal. He was blessing the people for their genuine act of praise and worship. It really is rare to see preformers who praise from their hearts. My favorite songs are Behold the Lord, The Diamond Turns and Why Should I Be Afraid.\n", "val": 0.011488418094813824}

What is amazing is that the leading western kirtan wallahs Bhagavan Das, Krishna Das, Jai Uttal and Shyam Das were all devotees of Majaraji in the 60s and 70s.  Bhagavan Das' vocals are geniune, heartfelt and moving.

{"text": "This was pretty much what I expected - a sweet mostly traditional version of Silent Night with a bit of Sixpence None the Richer's own style infused into it. Because the sample only includes the first verse, which is only the female vocalist, I wasn't expecting the male harmony to kick in on the second verse (which I found out, after poking around a bit, is one of the guys from Jars of Clay). Here's the lyrics he sings:I can see you in the snowI can tell that you've been cryingThere's nothing in these lights that glowthat tells you that this world's not dyingBut underneath these blankets whiteGlows a warmer kind of lightYou won't have to sing aloneChrist the Savior is bornChrist the Savior is bornI can see you in the snowCrystal tears have started dryingThere's something in these lights that glowA Savior in a manger lyingUp above these blankets whiteAre angels filling up the skyA star is burning in the nightJesus Lord...HallelujahChrist is bornHallelujahIt took a while to make out the words in the first set of his vocals, though, because the voices were distinct enough to hear his words along with hers. The sound was nice, but it isn't until the second set of harmonized verses that their voices are distinct enough to hear his words clearly. I wish they would have highlighted his voice more because his lyrics were new, while the female vocals are the same Silent Night lyrics we all know.The vocals aren't very powerful - more sweet and ethereal than strong and bold - but that's what I would expect for any rendition of Silent Night. It isn't a power ballad, but rather a sweet Christmas tune. All in all, it's a nice addition to my Christmas music library. (If this is too syrupy sweet for you, though, check out Third Day's Offerings album. It's not a freebie like this one, but it's worth the price and much more powerful.)\n", "val": 0.008967463858425617}

{"text": "Wow another amazing album from one of the greatest bands around today.  I will rate each song skipping the intros.Truth Rising - The opening track.  Not as strong as an opener as live or die free but still a great song and an excellent track to open the album.  Gets your blood pumping and builds your excitment.  My only complaint is it would be longer.  9/10It's All over - Wow!!!  This is the best Hed song i have ever heard.  This is such a blistering song.  Jahred screams 90% of the song and the guitars and drums are played at a blistering pace.  Easily heds heaviest song.  Great track.  I wish they would make an entire album like this song.  15/10No Rest For The Wicked - This is the same song that was on their greatest hits.  Not a bad song.  Another strong song that you can listen to over and over again.  I like the slow breakdown in the middle of the song.  9/10This Fire - I at first didn't like this song but now that i have listened to the album about 25 times, i have grown to like it.  I have always like the instrumental part of the song but the lyrics did do it for me right away.  I still don't like the \"this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine.\"  I just can't stand this line of the song.  Anyways not a terrible song but not great eigher.  7/10.Takeover - I really like this song.  Its a song about sex and has some dirty lyrics and features Jahred rapping.  Over all a huge step up from This Fire.  9/10.Stand up feat. Lajon of sevendust - A great song.  I really like Jahred and Lajon sharing vocal duties on this song.  The guitar playing is also amazing on this song.  Jaxon really shows off his guitar playing skills.  10/10.Menina - I didn't know what to think of this song when i first heard it.  Most of the lyrics are not in english and i have no idea what Jahred is saying.  However it is a catchy song and the instrumentals save this song from being terrible.  7/10.Forward Go - A very strong song to start off the second half of the album.  Just a good punk song.  8/10.Bad News - Another strong punk song.  However i like this one better than forward go.  9/10.Murder - A typical dirty sex song done Hed style.  A huge improvment over Mirrorballin on Insomnia.  8/10.Children of the Fall - i love this song.  Another strong punk song just like forward go and bad news, only this one is the best of the three.  10/10.No More Secrets - Wow!  My second favorite song on the album.  Jahred really shows off his rapping skills on this song.  Reminds me of Game Over from Insomnia due to all the rapping.  12/10.WhiteHouse - A completely pointless song about Obama being in the white house.  Next please.  3/10.We Are The Ones - This is a different song.  I still don't know what to think of it but i do know that i like it.  Its a very experimental song for Hed pe.  However, it is a strong track to close the album.  9/10.Overall, This album is right up there with Insomnia as Hed's best album\n", "val": 0.02204182744026184}

{"text": "I'd have to admit I've been very skeptical about each Hed release since Only In Amerika. After being disappointed with New World Orphans and the release of the awful track \"Here And Now\" I thought to myself I think it's time to give up on this band. But no... for some reason I stick with them and hopes that they do something right and worth listening to. With Truth Rising I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't an awful mess and actually a decent outing. One thing that has drove me nuts with Hed is the crappy punk songs as of late. Some of them work and some are just God awful. Truth Rising keeps the crap to a minimum this time around. The band shows some real growth here musically. Song structures are stronger and production although still raw is much better here. Lyrically Jarrod is still the same trying to spread the truth movement to the youth which doesn't bother me because I've always enjoyed political music. I think Hed Pe took a little more time in the studio and it shows. This is the album I've been waiting for since Only In Amerika. It's more aggressive like the older Hed style and even some clean choruses that actually work. There's still a few punk tracks here but less annoying. In my opinion this is the strongest album as a whole since Blackout. I actually enjoyed every song on here with the exception of Murder, gets old after about 2 minutes. My only complaint is that there's too many intros and interludes again but overall it's a better album and I was actually impressed.\n", "val": 0.008528267964720726}

Just saw MC rut play live and they were FANTASTIC, great attitude, great stage presence, every song was awesome, their main song is a bit repetitive but every band has at least one song like that to appease the masses and get some radio play but these guys deserve it. Just so happens that Janes addiction was the headliner at Edgefest where I saw MC rut...I have always liked Janes addiction but they were terrible live, super cheesy show with 2 strippers(only good part of their performance). Janes sounded bad and just acted like creepy old men. Have nothing against older rockers, saw ozzy a couple months ago and he was still amazing. Get this. Love it.\n", "val": 0.009180576540529728}
{"text": "this band is terrible, they best way I've heard to describe them is a poor mans Janes Addiction.  They are repetitive and extremely mundane sounding, and I say that objectively, as sometimes repetition can be very good, but not in this case.  Their main single is probably the worst on the album and is overplayed on the radio constantly.  The entire song sounds like what should be the first 30 seconds of a song building up to something, like, I dunno an actual rhythm.  The lyrics are even worse than the music and are not sung, rather talked.  If you like listening to the same couple power chords and mediocre drumming while someone speaks the lyrics of a song like hes reading cue cards then this band is for you.  But if you like anything that has any type of variety or musical talent I would suggest anything else.. anything, really.\n", "val": 1.4951388948247768e-05}

{"text": "I saw these guys last night with 30 Seconds to Mars (I know...I know...wife got the tickets), and was blown away. I'm still amazed just two guys can make such excellent loud noise. The best way I can describe their sound is a three way split between Jane's Addiction in vocals, Rage Against the Machine in intensity, and Finger Eleven in popiness. Busy Bein' Born and New Low are enough to carry the album, but No Name No Color is a solid work throughout. Thematically, as the band's name suggests, MC Rut taps into present day middle class economic anxiety that is easy to relate to no matter your political persuasion. \"USA\" and \"One Debt Away\" could easily fit into a mix with Anti-Flag while \"Dead End\" could be a Tea Party anthem. It is smart loud angsty rock that fits well on work out or long drive playlists.\n", "val": 0.026651505380868912}
{"text": "I saw MC Rut open for Filter in early November 2010 in Cleveland on a cold, chilly night at the Grog. I walked in and these guys were on stage. Usually w/ openers, they lose my attention quick and I start playing on my Droid. NOT THESE GUYS. I didn't even remember I had my phone in my pocket until they walked off the stage. It was ONE after the OTHER of straight-forward no BS raw rock. What radio has lacked since the late 1990's. They played some material from the Red EP (which I did not know existed until recently) and a few songs from the debut LP here. I remember them closing out w/ \"Busy Bein' Born\" and just being floored with the sheer intensity of the song and loud performance. \"Alive Or Dead\" rules, as does \"USA\", both of which were played. \"One Debt Away\" is one of the best songs Ive heard the past year, too.Oh, and Im sure you all know \"New Low\", which is probably why you are reading this.Suffice to say, I bought the CD the night of the show, thanked the guys and hope to see them again down the road. I don't want to compare these guys to Local H (my all-time favorite), but they share some of the same qualities. They both can turn heads with their loud 2 man setup and both lead singers can scream like a motherf*@%$.GET THIS. NOW.The bonus songs on the Deluxe are both great, too - the best being \"Free Lot\".Oh and someone get these guys a good touring partner. Im sorry, but My Chem and 30STM just don't cut it. Those bands cater to the teenage/20something female crowd, and outside of \"New Low\", I don't see many of those fans liking these guys.\n", "val": 0.004859024193137884}

{"text": "Middle Class Rut (MC Rut) is a 2 piece band from the defunct band Leisure, circa 2003. It consists of lead singer/guitarist Zack Lopez and drummer Sean Stockham. I used to be a fairly avid Lesiure fan but when they fell of the radar I had no idea what happened. Fast forward to about 2007 and I found out that 2 of the 4 members created MC Rut. \"New Low\" was a song that was played in my area (Sacramento, where they are from) and I took a liking to that song after several listens. 2 eps later they have released the album \"No Name No Color\" and it truly does not dissapoint. There are a few tracks from the last 2 eps on here but it is understandable as it is very, very hard to find the eps and the reworked versions are a lot better quality and are a little different. This band is, basically, pure unadulterated rock. You can hear hints of Jane's Addiction, Rage Against The Machine, heck...I even heard Sparta but the influences mostly just come from the voice of Zack Lopez which isn't his fault...it's just how he sounds. Whereas the 2 eps were more raw and fast paced rock this album has more experimentation to it, in a good way. The raw fast paced rock is very evident on this record but once you get to the track \"Are You On Your Way\", which by the way is in the top 3 of this album, things slow down a little bit and what you get is I very honest track that you know has some history to it. And that is what this record is about: honesty and history. Zack Lopez has no problem expressing his concerns with the past and present and is not ashamed to admit that he has done wrong, which is very evident on \"New Low\", a track I can also very much relate to and I am sure everyone can to. We all make mistakes, we all have past sorrow, we have all done wrong and that is why this album just feels complete all the way through. Besides being an album that you don't have to skip a track to, besides being an album that is something to tap your feet to, it is an album that you can relate to and hear in the voice of Lopez. If you have never heard of this band I recommend you should take a listen because you really are missing out on an act that deserves all the attention they can get and to me that is very hard to come by nowadays.\n", "val": 0.007181364111602306}

{"text": "I bought this album about a month ago after having previewed it every now and then for the past several months prior. I normally don't like a lot of the hard rock bands out there nowadays (like Breaking Benjamin, Three Days Grace, Papa Roach just to name a few examples) because they all seem like they're writing music just to make money and not because they have something to say. I did buy it because I've heard New Low quite a bit, but also heard the potential in the other songs. I knew it could be a good album, but didn't expect it to have the depth that it has lyrically. I didn't notice it at first because I was just listening to the catchiness of the music, but once I started listening the lyrics more closely I've found them pretty impactful, songs like New Low, One Debt Away, Sad To Know and Dead End. I feel like they are writing to me or about me, definitely an album about \"where do I fit in this world and what do I do with myself\". I had the cd in my car stereo for about 3 weeks straight, and I can't stop listening to it. Overall my favorite songs are Busy Bein' Born, USA, New Low, Lifelong Dayshift, Alive or Dead and Dead End. It's really refreshing to hear music approached in a new a way, trying something different, that being this group is a hard rock duo and not a trio or more. I really hope these guys gain some well deserved recognition and make more great music soon.\n", "val": 0.01242020633071661}

I was hesitant to buy the CD though, since it had so few reviews.I'm not trying to win the 'most helpful' review for this album, so I'm not going to go in depth on the review.This CD is very good, I loved it. MC Rut will be played heavily for a while in my CD rotation. All the songs are very good, and their single 'New Low' represents the band fairly well. Although, the drummer (Sean) has a lot less leads than he does in the song New Low.So, if you don't like the guitarists voice, (he gets the bridge, and the lead vocal on the chorus in New Low) you might be disapointed in the CD.

I just might invest in another CD of the original soundtrack to compare the two. I need to know if they are the same...!  You might guess I was somewhat disappointed with this CD. Another try? I think so as I really liked the movie score and the impact it left with me. Check me out later if you wish when I have satisfied my curosity.\n", "val": 2.025227695412468e-05}

{"text": "Gone With The Wind in my book is the greatest score ever composed. This is the epitome of film music and represents everything that Max Steiner is as a composer. The amount of emotion and feeling behind that main theme is stunning. The score has been around for a very long time and has been written about many times. In fact you could write a book about this score alone and not scratch the surface of its significance. What I'm looking at here more specifically is this release from Sony Masterworks. This release is a re-recording of the score by Charles Gerhardt and The National Philharmonic Orchestra.Now, I hate re-recordings. Pure and simple I think there is no substitute for the original sound of any score. However I do agree that some scores from the past have aged considerably and their quality has deteriorated. Gone With The Wind is one of those scores. The original recording is muffled, scratchy, poppy, hissy and all sorts of nasty adjectives you'd associate with sound. However there is no substitute for it. The magic that it holds in knowing you are listening to the same instruments used in the film cannot be denied. So that brings us to this release. Is this re-recording faithful to the original? Absolutely 100%. In fact it's one of  the most faithful re-recordings I've heard. The spirit of the score is captured eloquently and brings forth a quality not heard in many years to this wonderful score. Does it sound like a remastered version of the original? No. Lightning can't strike twice. Whatever air was in the room when the original was recorded is forever gone and will only remain in the original recording.To me Max Steiner's score to Gone With The Wind is what film music is all about. It has one of the most recognizable themes in film history and embodies the film in such a way that only listening to it can explain. I do applaud Sony Masterworks and Charles Gerhardt for taking the initiative to restore this and many other scores through re-recordings. I was presented with the complete collection to review and it was an overwhelming site. I decided to review my favorite which was Gone With The Wind but I will present the complete list of what you can find below. Hopefully one of these compilation scores tickles your fancy enough to go and explore it once again.RELEASED MARCH 1, 2011Citizen Kane - The Classic Film Scores of Bernard HerrmannIncludes selections from On Dangerous Ground / Citizen Kane / Beneath the 12-Mile Reef / Hangover Square / White Witch DoctorSunset Boulevard - The Classic Film Scores of Franz WaxmanIncludes selections from Prince Valiant / A Place in the Sun / The Bride of Frankenstein / Sunset Boulevard / Old Acquaintance / Rebecca / The Philadelphia Story / Taras BulbaElizabeth and Essex - The Classic Film Scores of Erich Wolfgang KorngoldIncludes selections from The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex / The Prince and the Pauper / Anthony Adverse / The Sea Wolf / Deception / Another Dawn / Of Human BondageSpellbound - The Classic Film Scores of Mikls RzsaIncludes selections from The Red House / The Thief of Bagdad / The Lost Weekend / The Four Feathers / Double Indemnity / Knights of the Round Table / The Jungle Book / Spellbound / IvanhoeNow, Voyager - The Classic Film Scores of Max SteinerIncludes selections from Now, Voyager / King Kong / Saratoga Trunk / The Charge of the Light Brigade / Four Wives / The Big Sleep / Johnny Belinda / Since You Went Away / The Informer / The FountainheadClassic Film Scores for Bette DavisIncludes selections from Now, Voyager / Dark Victory / A Stolen Life / The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex / Mr. Skeffington / In This Our Life / All About Eve / Jezebel / Beyond the Forest / Juarez / The Letter / All This, and Heaven TooLaura / Forever Amber / The Bad and the Beautiful - David Raksin Conducts His Great Film ScoresIncludes selections from Laura / Forever Amber / The Bad and the BeautifulRELEASED OCTOBER 19, 2010THE SEA HAWK - The Classic Film Scores of Erich Wolfgang KorngoldIncludes selections from The Sea Hawk / Of Human Bondage / Between Two Worlds / The Sea Wolf / The Constant Nymph / Kings Row / Anthony Adverse / Deception / Devotion / Escape Me NeverGONE WITH THE WINDIncludes all the unforgettable music from Max Steiner's epic scoreCAPTAIN FROM CASTILE - The Classic Film Scores of Alfred NewmanIncludes selections from How to Marry a Millionaire / Captain from Castile / Wuthering Heights / Down to the Sea in Ships / The Song of Bernadette / The Bravados / Anastasia / The Best of Everything / Airport / The RobeCASABLANCA - Classic Film Scores for Humphrey BogartIncludes selections from Casablanca / Passage to Marseille / The Treasure of Sierra Madre / The Big Sleep / The Caine Mutiny / To Have and Have Not / The Two Mrs. Carrolls / Sabrina / The Left Hand of God / Sahara / Virginia City / Key LargoLOST HORIZON - The Classic Film Scores of Dimitri TiomkinIncludes selections from Lost Horizon / The Guns of Navarone / The Big Sky / The Fourposter / Friendly Persuasion / Search for ParadiseCAPTAIN BLOOD - Classic Film Scores for Errol FlynnIncludes selections from The Adventures of Don Juan / The Sea Hawk / They Died with Their Boots On Dodge City / Objective, Burma! / The Sun Also Rises / The Adventures of Robin Hood\n", "val": 0.007946251891553402}

They each have a different sound vocally, but when you blend their voices together, especially when they harmonize, like they do on so many of their songs, it is pure magic! Funny thing is, I purchased the CD for my kids, but I too love every single track on this CD.  Every single song is terrific.

With all of the \"boy band\" fever lately, it's hard not to like Big Time Rush. They look good, and they sound good. They have great harmonies and great lyrics. I am a \"boy band\" enthusiast so had very high expectations for this album, hoping it would be like Nsync, Backstreet Boys and other, and they were much like them. At times their harmonies are exceptional, like in Nothing Even Matters, and Count on You. Sometimes, like in Oh Yeah, I felt like it was one sided, and more of a solo song. Overall though, the rock pop flare of the whole album was great! My favorite song is Worldwide, but all of them are great. Can't wait to hear more from them!\n", "val": 0.04805965721607208}

{"text": "Though I may live in a cave (a.k.a. I do not have cable or satellite t.v.), I have been following the Nickelodeon show, Big Time Rush for some time now. I first saw it when I was baby sitting for a neighbor of mine. I have been watching it on nick.com ever since. Although I find it confusing that they became a group in real life because of the t.v. series and they use their fictional group's songs as their own in real life, I love Big Time Rush's music. I love cleverly written lyrics and music, but I also enjoy fun, upbeat tunes such as the ones included on this album. This is the type of boy band I needed when I was a ten year old listening to Nsync. They have the good boy band traits (poppy and upbeat)without exposing their listeners to suggestive themes and such. I do have a slight problem with a couple of the themes simply because they may be too shallow, but they are not over the top. All in all, this is fun music to enjoy without worrying about listening to with young kids and feeling like a kid. Although all these guys are at least twenty years old, the songs have a youthful sound to them, which I love.The stand out tracks for me are \"Till I Forget About You\", \"Nothing Even Matters\" and \"Big Night\". The tracks that do not impress me very much are \"Oh Yeah\" and \"Boyfriend\".Something I do not like about this album is that it does not contain all the songs from the show such as \"Any Kind of Guy\".\n", "val": 0.0124816307798028}

{"text": "Well, first of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this album. At first, I was hesitant to watch their show on Nick but after a couple episodes I really started to like them and their music.  In 2010, I bought a huge amount of CD's that were released this year and I have to say that BTR was my favorite album of the enire year.  I just found myself listening to it over and over when I was cleaning, organizing, or even working...I really liked it.  I have probably played it about 50 times all the way through.  Ok, enough of my blabbering.  This is how I am going to review it: I'm going to talk about each song in this album, so here I go...1. Til I Forget About You...5/5This song was really catchy and it's nice to listen to when you need a little of energy or to make you happy.  I think that this was a great way to start off the album.2. Boyfriend...4/5I was never a huge fan of this song even when it came out on the show but I have to say that it is actually quite nice and catchy.  It's what teen boys go throught with their first loves and overall it is nice.3. City Is Ours...5/5Another great upbeat song by the boys.  Nice and catchy and I really enjoy it everytime I listen to it.4. Nothing Even Matters...5/5This song is also really nice and I really like that Logan is the main performer in this song; he doesn't get many solos.  It's nice the whole way through.5. Worldwide...5+/5This song is one of my favorite songs ever.  I really love the way James and Logan execute this song.  Their vocals are great and they did an amazing job.  Carlos and Kendall are also showcased in this song and it makes it even better that all four of them actually have a part in the whole song.  I just really like the way James sings here...and I have to say he is my favorite singer from all of them but I like all four.6. Halfway There...5+/5Amazing!!! I really like the message of this song A LOT!!! It's meaningful and it empowers you to reach for the stars and to achieve all your dreams.  My favorite saying in this song is Logan's solo.  A great, powerful song.7. Big Night...5/5This song is great because it makes you want to get up and move.  It's just an upbeat song with great vocals.8. Oh Yeah...4/5This is probably my least favorite song in the whole cd.  I enjoy it but not as much as the other tracks.9. Count on You...5+++/5This one and Worldwide are my favorite ever.  I have never been a fan of Jordin Sparks but this song made me see her in a different light; it made me appreciate her voice.  I don't have words to describe this song; I just love it to death.  She and the guys did an amazing performance.  AMAZING!!!10. I Know You Know...5/5This is another great song.  I really like it and the girl here is great too.  The guys' voices really fit the beat of the song.11. Big Time Rush Theme...5/5Who doesn't like this song?  It introduced us to these guys.  It plays over and over on the T.V. show and it's just great and fun.EXTRA: I have the album that has STUCK and THIS IS OUR SOMEDAY as extra tracks and I have to say those are also amazing, especially Stuck.  I believe that Stuck should've been on the final album but I don't know whey it wasn't included.  It's great, and I'm pretty sure that fans would've loved it even more.Well, I hope you like my review.  I never thougth that this was going to be so great.  I'm 23, and I'm happy to say I love Big Time Rush!!!\n", "val": 0.0280270017683506}
{"text": "Some people say that BTR is just a show to mimic Jonas from Disney channel.... Wrong!! I've watched both shows and they are nothing alike. Jonas brothers are already famous, yet BTR are a brand new band struggling with becoming famous. They literally started from the ground up. I love the show and they're CD album has a song for everyone. It has pop and hip hop with a dash of rap in a few songs. I don't think they rap but there are featured artists who do. I would really recommend this to preteens. They would love it! And watch the show please on Nickelodeon. It's funnier than Jonas. Just my opinion.

It really was a welcomed surprise that it delivers noblely well, especially in a year where lackluster music acts like Rihanna and Lady Gaga have made fools of themselves, where style overlooks real voice.

{"text": "Far East Movement's been around for a few years now, though I never really listened to their music.  However, with the release of their album \"Animal\" and their underground hit single \"Girls on the Dance Floor\",  Far East Movement is starting to get attention world wide.  Girls on the Dance Floor has gotten radio play all over the United States and even on MTV's America's Best Dance Crew.  The attention earned Far East Movement a record deal with Cherry Tree Records.On the heels of GIrls on the Dance Floor, Far East Movement follows up with \"Like a G6\" and it is arguably a more superior party song than GIrls on the Dance Floor.  The beats and the singing (by Dev and Far East Movement) is superb.  This song is definitely worth checking out as well as Far East Movement's \"Animal\" album.  Far East Movement is also releasing another album fairly soon as well.\n", "val": 0.026160025969147682}

It seems like these three siblings from Mobile, AL came out of nowhere, but I have a feeling you'll be hearing more from them. Even though they're young, their music has an authenticity to it, as you can hear in this song. Lead singer Kimberly explains the roots or that authenticity by saying, \"Daddy rocked us to sleep with the Rolling Stones; Mama woke us up with Loretta Lynn.

On this album I really like the \"Prelude\" from THE GUNS OF NAVARONE. This is a very powerful piece and why I purchased this album. It blew me away the first time I heard it and it still does. And I love \"Love Scene in the Barn\" from FRIENDLY PERSUASION. This track composed by Tiomkin is so tender and yet alluring. THE LOST HORIZON selection is very good and lengthy compared to the rest of the album. The biggest surprise on this album for me was THE BIG SKY selection. It has a kind of grandeur that captures the beauty of the land and the wonderment and character of those who were part of the early westward movement in America. I love this piece and this entire album.\n", "val": 0.05055851489305496}

{"text": "This CD, originally, of course, an LP, has always been a bit of a problem child in the famous RCA Classic Film Scores series.  The material selected for recording was, and is, marvelous.  It included not only the selections released, but one additional, a ten minute (or thereabouts) suite from Tiomkin's \"The Thing\", which went unreleased due to time constraints inherent in the LP.Unfortunately, the LP didn't sound quite as good as the other LPs in the series, although it wasn't far off.  It also had a much briefer release than the others, probably because it was one of the last releases in the series.When it was initially released on CD  by RCA, it was remastered into a \"Dolby Surround\" format that was, to be blunt, abysmal.  It seems that the engineers, for some unknown reason, had rolled off the top frequencies, introduced a bit of unnecessary reverb, and created a more \"concert hall\" type ambiance.  The various orchestral sections became indistinct.  Certain instrumental passages completely disappeared into the aural mush.  The chorus in \"Search for Paradise\" might as well have been singing in Sanskrit, so indistinct was their contribution.There seem to have been some problems in the recording sessions that were simply never addressed.  This was RCA's most ambitious recording in their Classic Film Scores series, requiring a huge orchestra, augmented percussion, and a large chorus.  It just seems to me the engineers must have been \"under the gun\". as it were, to get this in the can as quickly as possible.  After all, not too long after the original LP release, RCA pulled the plug on the project. I know for a fact there were additional recordings planned by conductor Charles Gerhardt and producer George Korngold that simply never saw the light of day.Anyway, I was very interested in what this new reissue had to offer.I am pleased to announce Sony has done a very nice job with this.  The bad news first:  \"The Thing\" is still not included, although it easily could have.  My guess is that Sony remastered from the original album masters, rather that from the original session tapes.  Therefore, content was already set.  Too bad.  However, the sound has been improved at least ten fold.  Mind you, it is still not perfect.  But that sludge like reverb in the former CD release is gone.  The sound, in general is brighter.  Brass instruments are more clearly focused.  The all important chorus in \"Search for Paradise\" is much more forward (without sacrificing orchestral clarity) and you can now actually understand some of the words.Well done!\n", "val": 3.6716159229399636e-05}

His guitar playing is impeccable and his playing on this CD is no exception. Debbie Grosjean is an equally accomplished fiddle player and the two of them teamed up together produce this fine music.  As far as the tunes go, don't think that this is boring stilted music.  On the contrary, you will find yourself urging Mr. Jefferson to play more while your feet are tapping the floor!  Of course many of the tunes are of a more classical nature, so you hear a mixture of music on this CD.  It is just a shame that it is lower quality MP files.  Not much point of buying the CD if it is nothing but MP3 files.  I could have saved myself $$$$ for shipping charges if I had known this was nothing but an MP3 CD.

{"text": "This album represents precisely what I was eager for - the authentic sounds of American colonial music in the highest of quality. I reccommend this to anyone who wants to know what the music of the American colonies during the 18th century sounded like at parties and dances, and to anyone who wants to be musically reminded of Colonial Williamsburg aside from its famous outdoor fife-and-drum marches. I think it's also an excellent choice for Revolutionary War period enthusiasts like me who could use a suitable type of music for listening pleasure while sewing, crafting, or cooking anything associated with that particuliar time in American history. I'm delighted that sound clips are available here to listen to as samples, and I'm happy to say I was clearly NOT disappointed. I'm equally impressed with the title of this album - something to make us think of the great American  Founding Father Thomas Jefferson! You can just picture Mr. Jefferson enjoying this exact music himself in a tavern full of fellow patriots and maybe playing it on his own fiddle in his beautiful Virginia home at his estate Monticello. Even if you're not fanatically interested in the colonial and Revolutionary War days, the music on this album can serve as a unique and relaxing treat rarely heard on even a classical radio station when you need a little break from today's more common music.

{"text": "Many have compared the Canadian Tenors with Il Divo. The comparison is very easy to make. 4 powerful singers who sing pseudo-opera (popera) music while milking the pop element of their music with lush arrangements. Music is a question of personal taste, so it seems silly to compare the two groups. Both are talented and have some stunning tracks which showcase their voices. I can only state my preference in this review.The Il Divo Christmas CD did not live up to my expectations. It was overproduced and oversung and had some bizarre song choices (Somewhere over the Rainbow?). It is, in my opinion, their worst effort to date. The Canadian Tenors do not make these same mistakes with this CD. They have an interesting yet relevant mix of songs. (even the previously-released \"Hallelujah\" and \"The Prayer\" fit in here). Classics (O Holy Night, God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen, Silent Night) mixed with interesting unique songs (Huron Carol, Wintersong, etc) make this CD an amazing listening experience. Their voices are soft and gentle when need be, and powerful and convincing when needed. The arrangements are unique and memorable. So, for me, this CD is much better than Il Divo's holiday CD.I hope you enjoy this CD during the holiday season! I will listen to certain tracks all year long. It is stunningly beautiful. \"Wintersong\" with Sarah Maclachlan is an ethereal, melancholic song that transports you to another world. It is my favorite track of the CD, but for me, there is not one single dud. I look forward to other releases by The Canadian Tenors!\n", "val": 0.007445556111633778}

The harmonies are extraordinary, the musical arrangements are splendid (thank goodness they are not the same tired old renditions), and the album as a whole has its own special quality.  Instead of the jingle-tingle-ringle that too often accompanies holiday music, this album has a way of wrapping around you like a warm blanket as one sits in front of a roaring fire on a cold night with warm hot chocolate.  Yes!  It's even comforting, soothing, and touched the depths of me that is too often too jaded after all the commercialization of the season.  Thanks to all who contributed to this album.

This is followed by James Taylor, whose music I don't particularly care for, but \"Carolina In My Mind\" is okay here, I suppose.  What I really like is the fact that it has 3 Badfinger songs (I've recently become a fan): \"Maybe Tomorrow\" from their Iveys days, \"Come and Get It\" (\"title track\"), and \"Day After Day,\" which has a beautiful arrangement of slide guitar that George Harrison dueted with guitarist Pete Ham on, and fitting piano work by Leon Russell.  Not too fond of \"Thingumybob,\" but I fell in love with \"King of Fuh,\" which is probably one of the best on here, with such creative lyrics that are really \"Fuh King\" funny.  \"Sour Milk Sea\", written by George and sung by Jackie Lomax, has emotion in the background music, recorded by the \"Threetles\" plus Eric Clapton, and in Lomax's Liverpudlian vocals.  \"Goodbye\" was written by Paul and given to Mary Hopkin, who also did excellent guitar work on the song.Not too much to say about the Preston (R.I.P.) songs on here, or the Abbey Road cover, but Hot Chocolate, best known for \"You Sexy Thing,\" has convinced me that some reggae can be good, especially this cover of John Lennon's plea to end the Vietnam War.  The melody of the chorus is hummed in the background throughout and the talking verse style of the original is revived with less suggestive lyrics.  The other aspect of this I find very intriguing is the mono mix.  Not a bad cover.Doris Troy's sole entry here, \"Ain't That Cute,\" is high-powered vocally, but it appears to be lacking some depth in the background.Anyone related to Phil Spector shouldn't be caught singing, so \"Try Some Buy Some\" loses some points.  \"Govinda\" is okay, and everything afterwards up to the amazing closing track, the final Badfinger one I mentioned, is fairly mediocre as well.IMO, you should skip out on individual albums and just pick up this, as a start.  After you have sampled the artists, it's up to you to decide what full albums you want.  Just don't go for the big box set; it's $300 and the physical box is flimsy, from what I've heard, as I didn't buy it.The simple artwork on the front and back of the case is just lovely, and follows the traditional Apple labeling: full apple on the front/A-side, half-apple on the back/B-side.  I just hate the stupid digipaks; That's all.Well, the title says it all: Come and Get It!\n", "val": 0.003006143029779196}
{"text": "An eclectic assortment that effectively distills the Apple catalog down to one bite-sized collection. The obvious highlights are the two Badfinger hits, the Paul McCartney-written \"Come and Get It\" and the George Harrison-produced \"Day After Day.\" There are so many Beatle-related tracks here, fans of the group wiould do well to acquire it.But lesser known gems abound, including Jackie Lomax's \"Sour Milk Sea\". The song was written by George Harrison and features quite a line-up: Harrison on rhythm guitar, Eric Clapton on lead, McCartney on bass, Ringo on drums. The only weak link is Lomax, who's voice isn't much to write home about.  Otherwise its a great rocking track. James Taylor's debut album was released by Apple, represented here by \"Carolina In My Mind\".Mary Hopkin's smash hit \"Those Were the Days\" leads off the set. Her follow-up hit \"Goodbye\" is out of this world. The song was written and produced by McCartney, and it is simply one of his unheralded classics. \"That's the Way God Planned It\" is performed by another supergroup: Preston on keys, Harrison on guitar, Clapton on lead, Keith Richards on bass, Ginger Baker on drums. Preston is also represented by his version of Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord,\" produced by George (and preceding his own version).Oddities pepper the CD...\"King Of Fuh\" by Brute Force is an amusing novelty number. \"Thingumybob\" was written by McCartney for the old-timey brass band Black Dyke Mills Band.  Trash's version of \"Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight\" comes off like a poor man's Beatlemania (the soundalike group of the late '70s). Hot Chocolate Band's rewrite of \"Give Peace a Chance\" is actually pretty interesting - their newly worded stream-of-consciousness verses arguably carry more weight than Lennon's original nonsense.With so much direct participation from all four Beatles, especially Harrison (who was involved in some way with nearly half the tracks), it's a great value for Beatles fans.\n", "val": 0.008288215845823288}

{"text": "The beauty of Apple Records was not that it was just another stream of Beatles revenue, it was a representation of the Beatles idealization in which anything was welcomed. The musical contents in this tribute to the coolest \"independent\" label that's ever existed spans a four-year period. Some of the pop, such as Jackie Lomax or Ronnie Spector, is pleasant but pedestrian, especially compared to their flagship model. But only the two worst offenders, Trash's \"Golden Slumbers-Carry That Weight\" and Lon and Derrek van Eaton's \"Sweet Music\" are in serious need of fumigation. The Radha Krishna Temple is boring, yet I'm torn over it because this is an integral part to what Apple stood for. And if Billy Preston's version of \"My Sweet Lord\" is slightly bland, it's easy to be overcome by his other gospel tune, the joyous \"That's the Way God Planned It\" - love it!Best in the pack include two surprise first-time pleasures: Brute Force's \"King of Fuh\" is a novelty worthy of Harry Nilsson's \"Coconut\" and Hot Chocolate's \"Give Peace A Chance\" is an English reggae even more thoughtful than the original. Not to be outdone are two great ones that are well known. The whimsical-folk, \"Those Were the Days\", is still impressive in its recollection. \"Day After Day\", by Beatles imitators Badfinger, is the greatest Beatles imitation to hit AM radio since the Knickerbockers 1965 smash, \"Lies\". Their \"Come and Get It\" is essential to this company too.It can be argued this is strictly a hodgepodge, but I like how much of this pulls together under a vision. Unfortunately, this well-meaninged label wouldn't last for long, but it succeeded in opening channels for many different styles of music.

{"text": "Regarding the missing B-sides and whatnot - yes there is a bit missing but it is true with these compilations that you cannot please all. But I can play this entire collection without skipping songs and that is hard to do with most retrospective compilations. Along with true classics such as \"Sour Milk Sea\" (a needed track for Beatles complete collectors) - and a great introduction to Badfinger - one of the most underrated bands ever - there are some nice surprises - \"Thingumybob\" was an introduction to further McCartney experiments with the New Orleans sound in the 70's - I forgot how much Billy Preston added to \"My Sweet Lord\" - it really is the definitive version of a great song - and also includes \"That's the Way God Planned It\" - another decent song. \"God Save Us\" - a bizarre mix of Lennon protest with McCartney style vocals. \"Ain't That Cute\" by Doris Troy is a largely unknown gem. Aerosmith obviously used the Hot Chocolate Band cover of \"Give Peace a Chance\" as inspiration for their own version of not so long ago. And there are misses, but they are not fatal to the collection. \"King of Fuh\" has many fans who delight in the junior high school humor of the \"fuh king\" but the song is rather catchy with a piano line that you could imagine being played by Lennon. The oddly offbeat old school country song \"Saturday Nite Special\" doesn't really fly but again does not really bring down the set. It is interesting to listen to James Taylor's first \"Carolina In My Mind\" although he did improve on it later - I guess the only real miss is Ronnie Spector's \"Try Some Buy Some\" which George Harrison did re-record with only a little bit better success on his \"Living in the Material World\" LP. For those who complain about no Beatle songs (even solo Beatle songs) - you can pretty much find any Beatle solo work elsewhere but many of these tracks are only found here - there is a much more extensive Apple record box set available for the hard core collector (no pun intended). Overall though, anyone with an interest in the Beatle experiment at record label management will find this satisfying - you may be surprised to find yourself singing along with \"Govinda\" and George may be proud.

{"text": "This delightful sampler of The Beatles' very own label is a lot of fun, if also loaded with plenty of trifles. It pulls a whole batch of lost 45's and gathers them onto one 21 songs salute. It's also a bit of a history lesson as to where The Beatles themselves thought music would head. They where often spot on, with the discovery of Badfinger (3 singles), James Taylor (the original version of \"Carolina On My Mind\") and Billy Preston (two singles). There's a few misses who should have been bigger (Mary Hopkin, with her classic \"Those Were The Days\") and Chris Hodge, whose near hit in the USA, \"We're On Our Way\" was one of the last Apple Singles.Also plenty of fun stuff in the middle, like British Starr Jankie Lomax's Harrison penned \"Sour Milk Sea\" and a novelty TV theme for a Brit Comedy \"Thingumybob,\" written by McCartney and played by The Black Dyke Mills Band (allegedly the \"most famous brass band in the world). The goofiest of these is the rarity \"King of Fuh,\" by Brute Force, who was a member of The Tokens (of all groups!). Reportedly only 1,000 copies were ever pressed and its obscene double-entendre (\"All hail the Fuh King\") had factory workers at EMI refusing to handle it.There's a handful of duds, as well. Hot Chocolate eventually became a hit-making pop band (\"Emma\" and \"Every #1's a Miracle\"), but their reggaed version of \"Give Peace a Chance\" is forgettable. Lennon's early foray into political singles, \"God Save Us,\" is overbearing. \"Golden Slumbers-Carry That Weight\" by Trash was a sneak peak at The Beatles' \"Abbey Road,\" and won't make you forget the more famous version. It's very telling to hear how many of these artists were \"Applized,\" with different members of The Beatles writing, playing or producing these acts in their own image. Compare Taylor's Apple \"Carolina On My Mind\" to the more famous version; it's obvious he was being pushed to a sound that wasn't a completely natural fit.Overall, however, \"Come And Get It\" is a treasure trove of lost singles that Pop History buffs will thrilled to have. Beatlemaniacs will find it a must own, and plenty of folks who'd listen to old AM radios will likely discover forgotten songs buried in the back of their aural memories.\n", "val": 0.00548249576240778}
{"text": "It is a collection that is long overdue.  When John, Paul, George and Ringo founded Apple Records back in 1968 they intended the label to be the home not only for their own music but also for deserving artists they had discovered or were supporters of.  Apple would be a bit different from most other labels in that The Beatles had the financial wherewithal to take chances on unconventional artists and eclectic new sounds.  The boys scoured the countryside for offbeat sounds and brand new artists they thought had potential.  Likewise, they invited some established recording artists back into the studio to cut some new sides for the label.  \"Come And Get It:  The Very Best of Apple Records\" offers up 21 of these marvelous recordings packaged all together for the very first time.  When I discovered this collection online recently I was extremely excited and ordered it immediately.  Included were a number of tunes I had never even sampled before and several others that I had not heard in years.  Add to all of this some familiar hits by Badfinger and Mary Hopkin and this looked to me like a very promising collection.Mary Hopkin was just 17 years old when she was discovered by Paul McCartney in 1968.  She was a Welch folk singer and Paul deemed her voice perfect for a 1920's Russian folk song he was longing to record called \"Those Were The Days\".  Talk about unconventional!  McCartney's instincts were right on the money and \"Those Were The Days\" became a worldwide smash.  A year or so later Mary Hopkin would have another substantial hit in America called \"Goodbye\".  Both songs are included in this collection.  Perhaps you were unaware of this but the group Badfinger began life as The Iveys.  Their debut single \"Maybe Tomorrow\" was also released on Apple in 1968.  I heard this tune exactly once on the radio, loved it and never heard it again until I purchased this disc.  This is a terrific song and one can hear the great potential in this group.  It is no wonder that Apple signed them and as we all know Badfinger went on to have several huge hits.  Many people are unaware that James Taylor also got his start at Apple.  Take a listen to Taylor's debut single \"Carolina In My Mind\" and you will hear Paul McCartney on bass and the late George Harrison doing background vocals.  Great stuff!  The Beatles can also be credited with launching the highly successful recording career of the great Billy Preston during his his stint at Apple.  Enjoy both \"That's The Way God Planned It\" and Billy's version of \"My Sweet Lord\" on \"Come And Get It:  The Best of Apple Records\".As I mentioned at the outset the folks at Apple were always on the lookout for new and unique sounds.  Perhaps the most surprising act to be signed by Apple was an outfit known as The Sundown Playboys from Lake Charles, LA.  This was essentially a pick-up band of Cajun players who had recorded a side for a small Louisiana record label.  When one of the band members heard about the philosophy behind Apple Records he decided to send a copy of the disc to the label.  According to the liner notes George Harrison absolutely loved it and decided to acquire the rights to this recording and issue it on Apple.  Meanwhile, you can also sample a rather bizarre version of \"Give Peace A Chance\" by a group known as Hot Chocolate Band.  The collection also includes a mighty fine version of Lennon/McCartney's \"Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight\" by a band that called itself Trash.  Check it out!  One of my favorite cuts in this collection is a rockin' tune called \"We're On Our Way\" by Chris Hodge.  This was a minor hit in the U.S.A. back in 1972 and I actually owned a copy at the time but had not heard it in years. I had always heard of Jackie Lomax who was a contemporary of The Beatles in England but because he never achieved popularity on this side of the pond I had never actually heard any of his work.  You will find a pair or excellent Jackie Lomax numbers included here.  I would have to say that after listening to this album several times my favorite song just might be \"Ain't That Cute\" by Doris Troy.  The Beatles were huge fans of Doris Troy who was a very highly regarded R&B singer back in the day.  Born in the Bronx, Troy had a Top Ten hit in America with \"Just One Look\" in 1963.  But Troy was always more popular in England than in her native America and The Beatles were thrilled to sign her to Apple.  Another legendary recording artist who signed with Apple was the former lead singer of The Ronettes Ronnie Spector .  Her husband Phil was a producer at Apple in 1971 and the label signed Ronnie in the hopes of reviving her flagging career.  While that was just not to be I was glad to see \"Try Some, Buy  Some\" included here.  This is a wonderful song that I had not heard in decades.Now if you are an avid collector like I am and find yourself the least bit interested I recommend that you snap up a copy of \"Come And Get It:  The Best of Apple Records\" as quickly as possible.  It seems that this anthology was released with very little fanfare and that makes me wonder just how long it will be available.  I must tell you that the re-mastering job on these 40 year old recordings is terrific and I garnered a whole lot of useful information from the 16 page booklet that is included.  It is obvious to me that a whole lot of TLC went into putting this package together.  Very highly recommended!\n", "val": 0.019451167434453964}

{"text": "Beset by legal wrangles for much of its history, the music recorded for Apple has generally been less readily available than it would otherwise have been. Despite those problems, the important recordings, particularly by Badfinger and Mary Hopkin, have been available on CD. Nevertheless, a lot of other material has remained in the vaults. The release of this eclectic compilation apparently signifies the end of Apple's legal problems; let's hope so. The compilation is well presented, with the booklet containing copious notes about each song, which is particularly useful for learning a little about the obscure artist, though even the comments about the familiar songs may occasionally surprise you.Of course, Mary Hopkin (Those were the days, Goodbye) and Badfinger (Come and get it, Day after day, plus Maybe Tomorrow, credited to the Iveys who evolved into Badfinger) are represented, .but the primary purpose of this compilation (apart from selling plenty of copies) is clearly to showcase the range of music recorded for Apple, and it does that superbly, with a great variety .of sounds and styles.Aside  from the tracks by Badfinger and Mary Hopkin, the compilation is notable for the inclusion of Carolina in my mind (James Taylor), Thingumybob (a TV theme by the Black Dyke Mills Band), two gospel recordings by Billy Preston (That's the way God planned it,  plus a cover of My sweet Lord), an excellent track by the under-rated Doris Troy (Ain't that cute) and a cover of Give peace a chance, performed in a reggae style by the Hot Chocolate Band, who as Hot Chocolate became very successful throughout the seventies and early eighties.There are a lot of other great tracks here, all of which were originally released as A-sides of singles, but not all of which charted. The story given about King of Fuh is somewhat amusing. It certainly isn't the best track here, but it never received airplay at the time so it is in effect a new release. The inclusion of such rarities makes the compilation is more interesting than it would have been had it focused exclusively on the big hits, but it also means that the compilation subtitle, Best of Apple records, is not entirely true. Still, those hits and other important recordings (such as Badfinger's original version of Without you) will surely appear on a future Apple compilation.Enjoy this for what it is - a fascinating insight into the diverse music recorded for Apple records - and look forward to a follow-up compilation eventually.\n", "val": 0.014406613074243069}

{"text": "Ripe with possibilities Apple Records was The Beatles chance to establish a label that didn't play the same games that the big labels played and take artistic risks. It also gave them a tax shelter. The label fell short of its goal for a variety of reasons (including the dissolution of The Beatles themselves shortly after forming the label)BUT it did result in a variety of artists some of whom went on to much bigger careers AFTER Apple (James Taylor, Billy Preston, Hot Chocolate), some of whom had big hits for the label (Badfinger)and some of whom disappeared into obscurity.This collection takes singles from albums released by Apple as well as single-only releases for a variety of artists. The only place to find these single only releases is here on this compilation. The only thing that MIGHT have improved this set is to include the b-sides for each artists singles. The mastering sounds pretty good and it was done by the same EMI team that remastered The Beatles, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Badfinger catalogs for CD.\"Those Were The Days\" was a hit single for Welsh singer Mary Hopkins who also turned the Paul McCartney penned \"Goodbye\" into a hit single as well.\"Carolina on My Mind\"-James Taylor would go on to bigger hits after his producer and manager Peter Asher left Apple. Taylor would re-record this later.\"Maybe Tomorrow\" was a single by Mal Evans' discovery The Iveys who would undergo a name change (Badfinger) and score four top 20 hits before tragedy struck the band.\"Thingumbob\" is a McCartney penned song by The Black Dyke Mills Band a favorite brass band of McCartney's.(Exclusive to this release)\"King of Fuh\" was a novelty song that Apple picked up and was recorded by Brute Force. It's the story of the Fuh King (yep, say that fast and you'll understand WHY it was never released and WHY John and George love it. (Exclusive to this release)\"Sour Milk Sea\" written by George Harrison was recorded by Jackie Lomax a long time friend and musician that was signed to the label after his stint with The Undertakers was over. The song was a White Album demo that was rejected for the album and features George & Eric Clapton on guitars, Paul McCartney on bass, Ringo Starr on drums and Nicky Hopkins on keyboards. Lomax's R&B influenced \"New Day\" also appears.\"That's the Way God Planned It\" and \"My Sweet Lord\" were singles from Billy Preston's two albums that he recorded for Apple.\"Try Some Buy Some\" was a single recorded by Ronnie Spector written by George and produced by Phil Spector. It is exclusive to this set and although not a great track (and the music appeared with additional overdubbing on George's \"Living in the Material World\"). It's not a great track but it's nice to have it.\"Come and Get It\" recorded by Badfinger was written and produced by Paul McCartney for the band's first album. We also get Badfinger's Pete Ham's songs \"Day After Day\" produced by and featuring George Harrison on slide with Ham included as well.\"Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight\" recorded by Trash was a single of The Beatles tracks (exclusive to this set).\"Saturday Nite Special\" by the Sundown Playboys and \"We're On Our Way\" by Hodge are both exclusive to this CD as well. (both exclusive to this set)\"God Save Us\" by Bill Elliot and The Oz Band was written and performed by John Lennon and cohorts (no, not the other Beatles)and a single only release (exclusive to this set).\"Sweet Music\" recorded and written by Lon and Derrek Van Eaton is exclusive to this set. We also get Radha Krsna Temple's \"Govinda\".We also get a single recorded by Hot Chocolate who later went on to have more hit singles away from Apple (\"You Sexy Thing\").The 12 page booklet includes information on each recording artist included in this set.This is a nice set for those who only want the singles released from Apple or the exclusive songs to this set.It's a pity that there aren't any unreleased tracks here such as George's original demo for \"Sour Milk Sea\" with the same line up (except for Lomax) as it's pretty darn close to the exact line up for \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" but what we do get it quite good and for an anthology of what Apple put out this is very good indeed.\n", "val": 5.779364801128395e-05}

{"text": "Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (BRMC) introduces its first full album unders its record label. Leah Shapiro has stepped in to fill the gap of drums (Jago out of seat). This maybe BRMC teasing with their discography as a cumulative influence snapshot.BRMCs debut (BRMC) to music industry is one of R&R revival (with influence from JAMC). BRMC progressively teased with Psychadelia with a blues-timge in their sophmore release (Take Them On, On Your Own). BRMC almost ditched all electronics for the natural sounds in Howl (and 2nd Generation Bob Dylans shines off both Hayes and Levon-Been). BRMC went back to the heavy stuff on Baby 81.Beat The Devils Tattoo is the cultivation of all previous album designs and a new drum backdrop to the mix. Each track brings a sharp undertone of a previous album, but was well distributed to avoid a pattern forming. Leah Shapiro really complimented into this band and hopefully as the new permanent drummer. This is also the longest album produced by them.Definitely one of best albums of 2010 - but will remain underrecognized most likely.BRMC will remain a low key band with a devout fan base.I have immense respect for these guys (and lady) in producing some great music to avoid the present day typical \"noise and yammering so-called music\". While this is not their best work, its a good way of returning from a long hiadus and recovery.Will see them April 9th - cannot wait.\n", "val": 0.00829221960157156}
{"text": "Hayes and Been have come a long way from their high school days in San Francisco, and seem to finally be getting some broader attention in the wake of Howl and Baby 81.  Beat the Devil's Tattoo represents Leah Shapiro's debut with the power trio.  Formerly the touring drummer for the Raveonettes, Shapiro is stellar here.  She reminds me of Janet Weiss of Sleater-Kinney, only better suited to Hayes/Been.  For those of you who loved Baby 81 you will love this CD.  For those who preferred the direction B.R.M.C. was heading with Howl will be once again disappointed.  One of these days it would be nice of Mr. Been decided it would be artistically acceptable to include his cover of Dylan's \"Visions of Johanna\" which he performed recently at a concert in Vancouver on a future reissue of this release.  Courtney Jaye adds a fine guest vocal to \"The Toll\" which for the time being will console me for the want of Mr. Been's brilliant cover version aforementioned.  Outstanding tracks:  \"Bad Blood\", \"War Machine\", \"Evol\" \"Shadow Keeper\" and the closing ten minute twenty second \"Half-State\".  **** 1/2 stars\n", "val": 0.012931153178215027}
{"text": "Upon first listen of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's latest album, \"Beat the Devil's Tattoo,\" the first reaction might very well be that the range of sound is familiar, very much in the same vein as what the band has put out in years past.  The band has its niche, and while they continue to grow and change, overall they've decided to maintain an integrity and consistency with what they want B.R.M.C. to sound like.  This observation isn't a criticism -- it's refreshing to see a good band you can count on to not try to reinvent themselves every time it becomes fashionable to do so.  Fans who love past albums will love this.  Those looking for some good new music will find a unique and exciting listen in \"Devil's Tattoo.\"When people talk or write about the band, the influence of blues music always seems to get undercut, or perhaps just ignored.  The spirit of \"Howl\" displayed this blues influence more than the other albums perhaps, but B.R.M.C.'s electric, hard-driven rock has always sounded very blues-based.  On this album that influence is evident from the title track, to \"Conscience Killer,\" to \"River Styx.\"  Don't misunderstand -- this is not a blues record.  But the influence of blues into what this band does makes for some driving, head-noddin', foot-tappin' rock music that just makes you feel good.  It's an album that arguably gets better on the second and third listen.It's hard to not sound too over-the-top in praising the band.  In a music era where so much of what is put out for consumption is industrial, unoriginal, and just pretty bland, this band has been a breath of fresh air for this reviewer (pardon the cliche).  But it's true.  There isn't really another band that sounds like them putting out music as consistently as they are.  Yes, in many ways \"Devil\" sounds very much like their past records, but it's hard to see why that's a bad thing.  Maybe this isn't new territory for the band, but these songs are new, and that's reason enough to go out and pick this up.  I'm on my third listen for the day, and it sounds better each time.  Can't wait to see them live.\n", "val": 0.011976618319749832}
{"text": "In 2009, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club closed the final chapter on drummer Nick Lago, who was kicked out of the band after the \"Baby 81\" 2007 album and tour. Last year's excellent 2DVD/CD \"Live\" release brought highlights from that tour, and even though heavy on \"Baby 81\" tracks, this serves as an unofficial look back on the first 10 years or so of the band. In 2008, new drummer Leah Shapiro joined BRMC, and now finally comes the revamped band's fifth studio album.\"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\" (13 tracks; 65 min.) starts off with the title track, which just oozes \"Howl\" all over. After that, we return to the 'classic' heavy BRMC sound with the up-tempo \"Conscience Killer\", and a slow-burning \"War Machine\", one of the best tracks on here. \"Sweet Feeling\" is a nice acoustic breather. The 6 min. \"Evol\" is another highlight on the album. \"Mama Taught Me Better\" is a hard charging head-on rocker. There are a couple of songs in the middle of the album that seem unfocused or misdirected (such as \"River Styx\" and \"The Toll\"). Towards the end of the album, \"Shadow's Keeper\" is a nerve-shattering song that comes crashing down eventually, wow. But we're not done. The closer \"Half-State\" is a 10+ min. epic song that will blow up the roof.In all, there are enough good songs on here to keep me coming back, but the album is overlong and would've been served well by some tighter editing, keeping some of the weaker tracks for B sides and similar releases. I've seen BRMC a number of times over the years, most recently in the summer of 2008 when new drummer Leah Shapiro had just joined the band. She will do just fine, as she also proves on this album.

{"text": "With new drummer Leah Shapiro BRMC are back with a new studio album. The sound of the group is somewhere between \"Baby 81\" and \"Howl\"; less acoustic and basic blues inspired than \"Howl\"; but still with several numbers that might have fitted well into that album.As other reviewers have stated the album may well feel a little too longwinded and some of the less interesting tracks probably could well have been omitted, or possibly edited. However, it is remarkable that people seem to disagree about which songs are the weak ones.Personally, I think that the album has plenty of good songs and I won't hesitate to call solid and successful. There are though, no songs challenging my favorite with the group, \"All You Do is Talk\" from \"Baby 81\", though a couple of songs such as \"Evol\" and \"Bad Blood\" come close.Among other favorites the melodic acoustic ballad \"The Toll\" should be mentioned - a very moving song with nice harmony vocals from Courtney Jane who sounds almost like Emmylou Harris. Acoustic and melodic is also \"Sweet Feeling\", a song that grows with each listening.A few tracks sound very T. Tex inspired. This goes for to the heavy \"Aya\" - could almost have been an outtake from the \"Electric Warrior\". Bolan type boogie can be found on \"River Styx\". \"Long Way Down\", with piano accompaniment is also melodic and almost Beatles-esque in its sound. The title track could easily have stemmed from the \"Howl Sessions\". \"Shadow's Keeper\" has a Britpop sound, which might well have been inspired by Oasis.The closing track \"Half State\" is probably too long, while the \"Conscience Killer\", \"War Machine\" and \"Mama Taught Me Better\" all belong to a category of numbers I could have done without.\n", "val": 0.0023377572651952505}

With 13 tracks clocking in at 65 minutes, some pruning might have helped keep it more focused (see Interpol). The title track and album opener stirs memories of Howl (as does Sweet Feeling). The core of the album are the straight ahead tunes with the killer choruses, Conscience Killer, Bad Blood, Evol and Mama taught me better. Much here to like and another great record from BRMC.

{"text": "I have loved Black Rebel Motorcycle Club for about six or seven years now. I got into them after the release of TAKE THEM ON, ON YOUR OWN. A band from my native state, a distinct vocalist, moments of hard rock, but a band that could also survive slow songs without turning cheesy. After TAKE THEM ON, ON YOUR OWN, BRMC released HOWL, which, in my opinion, is an amazing album. A rootsy, southern rock, acoustic album that strays at times into deep soul and gospel music. Two genres I'm no real fan of, but when BRMC is the vessel, they managed to knock it out of the park.Then came BABY 81. And I think the two real problems with BABY 81 were 1. That it followed such an amazing album as HOWL, and 2. That it was so different from HOWL. For myself, I was severely disappointed because what I really wanted after HOWL was HOWL VOLUME 2. BRMC took things in a different direction, and now that a few years have passed and I have gone back and given BABY 81 another chance, I actually like it quite a bit, even though I feel some songs are a bit lengthy when they don't need to be.So now onto BEAT THE DEVIL'S TATTOO. This album maintains the same guitar power as BABY 81 had, but injects into it that southern roots feel that made me fall in love with HOWL. In fact, the whole album is so nearly a perfect hybrid between the previous and subsequent albums that I really feel like this should have separated the two. I think I would have liked this album more, and BABY 81 more as well. The album isn't new or original really, even as far as the previous work of BRMC, but it's a good listen, and a freshness lacking in the worship surrounding Miley Cyrus and Justin Beiber.The lyrics are also maturing. One thing I have always loved about BRMC is how well the emotion is conveyed in the vocals. \"I'd never known her to cry/But this time was different for sure/She's shakin' with tears in her eyes/As she picks up what's left of the night\" The beginning of the song 'The Toll,' is a fantastic break-up song, filled with simple drum and guitar chords, backed by a female vocalist (a rarity in BRMC). This bare style is what endeared me to HOWL, that something with so little physical substance can have such a profound effect.One last thing to mention is that BEAT THE DEVIL'S TATTOO seems longer than it actually is owing to how many slow songs there are on the album. The album barely reaches an hour in length, but because there are so few \"rock\" songs, it will feel longer. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing for others, but HOWL had mostly slow songs, and it is my favorite. In conclusion, you really can't go wrong with any BRMC album, and anyone who liked HOWL should definitely check this album out. Anyone who sort of stumbled into BRMC with BABY 81 and thought it was OK should still check this out. Sometimes BRMC zigs when you expect them to zag, but I, at least, will follow them wherever they go.\n", "val": 0.009170273318886757}
{"text": "I loved Baby 81, have listened to Howl a couple of times, and haven't heard their earlier albums. This one is deeper, darker, and denser than Baby 81, more fuzzy, with more distortion. Which is all good. Who doesn't like distortion? I generally like it, even if the vocals are buried down in the mix and harder to hear. But it is very reminiscient of the J & MC. It's also more monotonous -- there is no \"Killing the Light\" or \"666 Conducer\" or \"All You Do is Talk\" on this CD. Baby 81 really grabs my attention and it's hard for me to do anything but listen to it when it's on -- Devil's Tattoo I can listen to at work because it's not as demanding on my attention.\n", "val": 0.0005927914753556252}

{"text": "Let's get the main point out the way: this is a fantastic album. For a lot of BRMC fans, the question with each release is whether we would see a return to the bluesy acoustic sound we heard on Howl. This CD opens with a steady guitar strum that makes you think that this might be a return to Howl's sound..and then things get kicked up a notch, and you realize that this is going to be a fun ride.For the uninitiated trying to decide where to start with BRMC, I would break their albums down as follows: BRMC (their self-titled first album) is solid Jesus & Mary chain - influenced rock. Take Them On..., (their 2nd CD) is darker and less catchy but still within the same soundscape. Howl is a break from form, with an all-acoustic sound. Baby 81 is poppier than their previous CDs, but a return to the full-band rock sound. Beat The Devil's Tattoo is closest to Take Them Own... stylistically. If Baby 81 was a bid for a more mainstream sound, this album  sounds like a loud embrace of their indie roots. It's thick and gritty and not really that catchy, but it's still my favorite CD of 2010.Other reviewers have hit on a lot of the highlights, but I'll add a few favorites of my own: Aya (a really dark and powerful jam) and the driving title track. I'll also join the chorus of praise for the closer Half-State, which proves that sometimes songs are good enough to deserve ten minutes. If you're hungry for good old fashioned rock without the sentimentality or emo vibe of most current bands, then this is the album for you.\n", "val": 0.020997872576117516}

{"text": "With a name like \"Black Rebel Motorcycle Club\" your band better kick butt pretty hard.  Initially, I found myself to be a bit disappointed with these guys' music as a result of the expectation I felt was set by their name.  I know that may sound silly based on the whole don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover notion, but again, with a band name like that what do you expect?  It's a great one-of-a-kind name and when I first heard it I thought to myself, \"Oh man, these guys have got to be bad ass.\"That being said, I checked out their album \"Baby 81\" and wasn't too impressed.  I've really tried my best to give them a second chance with \"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\" and I'm medium-glad I didn't give up based on that initial disappointment.  These guys do seem to make fairly quality music.  And after all, even though the name is probably the number one contributing factor to a band's image, is it the most important factor?I'll let that thought simmer in your brain.There is one thing I know beyond a shadow of a doubt: if I ever find myself lost in some remote bayou in Louisiana I hope to heck that I have access to \"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\", because if I do, I'll feel right at home.Does that seem random?  Say yes.I say this time and time again, but the main thing that always speaks to me with any given album is the emotion it conveys.  \"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\" just has that raw, gritty feeling that makes you feel like you want to go on an excursion somewhere down south.Even though I initially felt like I wasn't getting those \"kick butt\" moments I yearned for at first, after really delving into this album I realized that they're there, just not in the way I thought they would be.  Take the song \"Aya\" for instance.  It's a slow-tempo song with not much going on besides a basic drum beat and chord progression.  But the fuzzy bass guitar really gives off the feeling that this song should have been included on the soundtrack to the film \"Black Snake Moan\".  Also, the soaring chorus of this song definitely qualifies as a \"kick butt\" moment.At around the 3:36 mark in the song \"Shadow's Keeper\" we experience another one of the album's peak moments in the form of an abbreviated bass guitar solo leading into this several-minute build up of all the instruments towards the song's end--this would be awesome to witness live.Another high point from this album is the song \"Sweet Feeling\".  Nothing gets me like a well-placed harmonica.  I could listen to a singer/guitarist play solo acoustic songs all day long if they include a good harmonica every now and then (think early Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album).  This song is a great example of good harmonica use.  I'm always of the opinion that use of a harmonica or lack thereof can make or break a song.I will credit the BRMC guys where it's due, they know how to end an album.  Clocking in at a whopping 10:20, the album's closing track \"Half-State\" is a fairly epic ride.  The length of the track alone is enough to leave you feeling tired but specifics like the pre-chorus hard rock jams make it that much better.Something thing that can give an album potential (and this is a weird factor cause you may never actually get this chance) is how well you feel like the songs contained would translate in a concert setting were you to see the band live.  With Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, especially with some of the songs on this album, I feel like they could put on a pretty rockin' live show.Overall I'd say that \"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\" has the potential to grow on you over time.  Parts of it are forgettable and represent garage-rock elements (\"Conscience Killer\") we've heard numerous times before but then again, there are parts (see above) that really stand out.  To put it quite simply, the album begins at probably its highest point with the title track and ends on a really solid note, but everything in the middle--while there are good moments--seems like kind of a blur.While listening to this album I've realized that it's possible for it to take months or even years for an album to grow on you to the point of you considering it a classic.  I'm not saying that I consider this album to be a classic by any means (it's definitely enjoyable) but who knows where my consideration of it could end up several months or even years down the road.  It's good enough to where it could stick for a while.  But can it really stand the test of time?While Black Rebel Motorcycle Club display good efforts time and time again, I'm leaning towards no.\n", "val": 0.00016605622658971697}

{"text": "Folks, I don't understand the negative reviews from people who received exactly what they paid for.CD singles are a very popular, highly collectible segment of the music business.  Since they are not made very often in the USA anymore, they have to be imported from Europe, Australia, etc.  That makes the price relatively high when compared to a full length domestic album.  However, one of the reasons CD singles are popular is that they typically contain tracks you will never find anywhere else.  While it is very likely you will still be able to buy the whole album years from now, the extra odd tracks on a CD single go out of print very very quickly and then you can't get them anymore.  Sometimes they are bonus tracks, sometimes they are remixes, sometimes they are live versions, etc.  They also often have unique cover art, which may not be important to casual fans of a song but is very important to big fans of the artist who display their collections proudly.This CD has \"Raise Your Glass\" as well as a live version of \"U + UR Hand.\"  The price is the price based on wholesale cost + import costs, etc.  If these sell for $5 to $8 each in their native country, then obviously they're going to have to sell for $10 to $14 in the USA.  Sometimes you can wait until they are no longer popular and get them at a better price.  But sometimes the price goes up instead - it all depends on the basic supply & demand.Fans of Pink would obviously know there is no such thing as a full-length album called \"Raise Your Glass.\"  Assuming something is a full-length album based solely on the price is not the way to go.  Yes, you have to read the description, even if that means scrolling down the page.  Often you can look at the picture and see the back cover which lists the tracks very clearly.  And keep in mind, sometimes the descriptions are not 100% accurate if they were just uploaded from a catalog, so if there is any doubt, ask your seller.  Many sellers specialize in CD singles and their customers appreciate the heck out of it.  Don't penalize them with bad feedback or the artist with a bad review because you made an incorrect assumption.\n", "val": 7.48304883018136e-05}

{"text": "I recently went on a hunt to find the best version of the Tchaikovsky symphonies. I listened to versions by Slatkin, Karajan, Haitink, Muti, Abbado, Mravinsky, and Jansons. I found the least convincing to be the Abbado and the Karajan. Karajan conducts in an older style that I can hardly tolerate anymore, romantic and excessive with rarely a steady tempo to be found. The Haitink sounded great but was often too slow, with the exception of his version of the 4th Symphony which I thought was one of the best. If you want a version that makes your blood boil, go with Mravinsky, though for me his style is also a bit old. The versions by Slatkin and Muti had a kinship in precision. Theirs were the most precisely controlled of all of them and I would rate them quite high, with Slatkin edging ahead. But better than all of them...much to my surprise...was the Pletnev. First, the recording quality was fantastic.  In audio quality alone it was the best, with the Slatkin neck-and-neck. Pletnev's style is modern and free of pointless romantic excess. He doesn't need to rush the tempo of the exciting parts because he starts out with a quick enough pace to make that unnecessary. The stylistic touches are minimal, but where they exist they are precise and appropriate. Of All the conductors listed above, Pletnev was the only one who trusted Tchaikovsky. All the others felt as if they had to add something to the score, as if it was their job to make it exciting because Tchaikovsky hadn't made it exciting enough, or perhaps over-indulging themselves as prima dona's. Pletnev has none of this. The music is as written and with just enough stylistic flourishes to accentuate phrasing. There are some legendary versions among those I listened to when searching for the best Tchaikovsky symphonies, but to my ears and heart Pletnev beats them all without breaking a sweat.\n", "val": 0.00596656184643507}

{"text": "<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Autumn-Again/dp/B0046P0GEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Autumn, Again</a>&nbsp;is a very good album from Philadelphia band A Sunny Day In Glasgow (ASDIG). It is only available for download right now, but a vinyl LP should be more widely available soon.  This is expansive dream pop, with elements of distant vocals typical of nu-gaze.  The sugar sweet melodies sometimes remind one of Celtic artists like Enya, but the arrangements evoke bands like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Pains-of-Being-Pure-at-Heart/dp/B001LGXIDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>.I don't often discover bands by reading blogs.  But this is that rare exception, as I discovered this band via a blog without having heard their music first.  With two studio albums and three EPs under their belt, this band has clearly laid their groundwork.  But they have also recently undergone significant personnel changes.  I wondered how their sound might change, and possibly degrade, without the recently departed band members.If this album is any indication, ASDIG are as vital as ever.  Unfortunately, without the liner notes I have no way of knowing if any of the tracks don't include all of the new members.If I had to compare this album to recent contemporaries, I would say this is a cross between the new album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ellipse/dp/B0028Y5MY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ellipse</a>&nbsp;from Imogen Heap and the debut album by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/XX/dp/B002N1AEN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">XX</a>.  There is a wide range of references that can be made and influences that can be heard here.  But the end result is an album that is all their own.  It has the sound of familiarity but the air of newness.The track listing doesn't totally give the listener an appreciation for how well this album is put together as one cohesive unit.  There are interludes like \"Autumn, Again,\" and \"Petition To Refrain From Repetition\" that are designed to seamlessly connect the tracks that are easier to think of as \"songs.\"  Then, there are interludes that become songs, like \"Moments On The Lawn\" and \"Drink Drank Drunk.\"  This is best enjoyed from start to finish, though several tracks have made their way into some of my playlists.CONCLUSIONThis is one of those albums that will appeal to so many different kinds of people.  If you like indie pop and electronica, you are most likely to appreciate this album.  I highly recommend you give this a listen.Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.003498825943097472}

We are all a work in progress, forever needing Jesus to create in us clean hearts.

{"text": "Let's start off with the track \"Fresh!!!\" What a BANGER!!! I love the electronica sound of this song.  Many of the songs on this album are a 360 from what we usually hear from Mr. Tribbett but different does mean it isn't good.  In fact, this album lives up to its name...It's FRESH. A lot of Easy listening, mellow tracks, some with a rock feel (we know Tye is a little of a rock star)...\"Only Help\" is one of the mellow tracks on the album! I love the way Tye sings the verses over this beat..Great song!! Eulogy starts off with a funeral sounding organ, I admit I was a little wary of this track but I continued listening and the lyrics...my friends are awesome...\"It's only one thing left for me to do and that's die to you.\" He's singing about letting go of the bad that has taken a hold of him and I think all of us can relate to this song...holding on to that something that's not good for us.  This album is REAL...and the lyrics are REAL..but Tye is always REAL with it so that's nothing new! \"Take over\" Lord \"All we want is You, Take Over til we are consumed.\" These lyrics reach the core of me..I want my heart and my life to be consumed by God. I love \"Holding On\"....very singer-songwriterish. You get Nothing but a piano melody and him singing. I think music sounds so much more honest when you just hear the voice and and a simple melody...You really hear Tye's heart on this one. I won't go through all the tracks but overall I think this is a great album, I won't say it's nothing like what He's done before but it's a sharp turn from the usual.  And that's a good sharp turn!! The music, sound effects and lyrics are ALL ON POINT! Keep it comin Tye..I'll always be a fan!Stand Out Tracks:FRESH, ONLY HELP, HOLDING ON, ALL FOR YOU, REPLACE ME, HALLELUJAH, WHEN THE ROCKS HIT THE GROUND\n", "val": 0.009021134115755558}

{"text": "I bought this album back in 2010, barely listened to the first few tracks then shelved it. I had very high expectations for Tye to top \"Stand Out\" and I didn't think he delivered at first. Now, 4 years later, I gave it another listen, and I absolutely LOVE IT!Here's what I thought of individual tracks:\"Fresh\" has a good techno beat...Tye really embraced the autotune on this one. Wasn't feeling it at first, but it grew on me...my favorite part is actually the end when his voice is extra digitized and he says, \"Everything fresh man everything fresh/Out with the old in with the new...\"\"Good\" is a great track musically and sounds more like classic Tye IMO. He's hype, he's passionate, he's yelling, \"Got to give You praise/You been so good to me!\" Love the drums, love the bass, love this track!\"Eulogy\" is another great track that got slept on. Admittedly, I wasn't feeling it at first and it took me several listens before it grew on me. I think the concept behind it is brilliant; he's doing his own eulogy at his own funeral after choosing to die to his flesh, in order to grow in Christ. It's what all believers must do at some point and I think the delivery of the track is great. Plus, I love the organ at the beginnning and the end.\"Take Over\" is another good one. Love the passion Tye puts forth. It conveys what should be the cry of every believer's heart, \"LORD take over my mind, heart and will! I give it all to You and I want more of You!\"\"Only Help,\" \"Holding On,\" \"Keep Me,\" \"You Alone\" and \"Your Blood (The communion song)\" are such excellent tracks that again, I slept on in the beginning. This whole set sounds very...Spirit led, reflective and devotional-esqe. I think I didn't like it at first because I'd gotten so used to Tye being this exuberant, hyper praise leader and had come to expect that style from him all the time. But these tracks prove that he's more than just a \"hype man for Jesus.\" He's human. He has struggles just like the rest of us. But at the end of the day, he knows Jesus is still on the throne. Lyrically/content wise, I think \"You Alone\" is the best track on the album. \"Your Blood\" is a close second.\"Champion\" is another good one. I'm also a big Israel fan so I liked the collaboration. \"We serve the undisputed champion of the whole world!\" I also like how \"Champion\" flows into \"Most High God (Lude);\" which is praise and worship music at it's finest. It has a very South African feel to it, which I believe it originated from, (although many countries in Africa have embraced this song and made it their own). \"Jehovah, You are the Most High God\" That simple sentence is the only lyric of the entire track, but it rings so true, and it makes me feel like I'm at church praising the Lord with Tye, Israel, and the entire corporate body of Christ.\"Rocks Hit the Ground\" beautiful track about God's grace and mercy. \"Thought it was over for me/You did not condemn me/Thought I was counted out/You did not condemn me/...And if I never heard the sound of grace before/I heard it when the rocks hit the ground\"\"Replace Me\" and \"Free to Worship\" LOVE LOVE these....they're the other 'Classic Tye' tracks on the album. The energy is CRAZY! \"Free to Worship\" opens with this banging guitar riff that just makes you wanna fist pump, play air guitar, stomp ya feet LOL. The drums on both tracks are crazy too.Overall, I thought the album was excellent. Very musically diverse, excellently arranged, and bibically sound. Although he's been in the game for a minute, this album sounds to me like his breakthrough album. Given the emotion and the message that he conveys in it, how he conveys them, and the lyrical, musical and spiritual growth..... IMHO, it's his best album. I respect a man who's not too prideful and so above God's rebuke and His grace to repent...and publicly at that.\n", "val": 0.022094599902629852}

{"text": "The tireless, trailblazing Tye Tribbett returned to center-stage with another scintillating CD packed with powerfully produced tracks, rich in reverent expression. FRESH, his fourth and most fearless album to date for Columbia Records is a signature album, marked by raw rock influences, techno-pop production and contrite, lyrical confessions from a sinner determined to make a spiritual comeback.The album gets off to a good start with the title track, Fresh, a 80s-retro funk-filled jam. Other dance inducing songs include, All For You and Free To Worship. But Tye Tribbett displays his most stirring voice and spirit on his more transparent selections like Only Help, Takeover and Holding On, a wealthy mix of haunting selections fixated on contrition and restoration.Additional songs like Keep Me, Your Blood and When The Rocks Hit The Ground reinforces a thematic flow obsessed with spiritual salvation, an understandable response to a difficult and turbulent season the experienced both in his personal and professional life. The songs are signature alter calls put to music. The sound and style of FRESH is a noticeable departure for the artist, who gained fame and notoriety as an exuberant personality and infectiously energetic artist.However, Tye Tribbett unveils both his complexity and sincerity by revealing his heavy heart in worship songs and holy praise throughout the album. Noteworthy is the dismantling of his kinetic chorale - Greater Anointing (GA) - but Tye Tribbett more than makes up for their absence through genius production and collaborations with notable names like Israel Houghton, Isaac Caree, Lowell Pye and Mali Music.The album marks a new chapter in the professional career and personal journey for Tye Tribbett.  As the artist best described it, \"Out with old...in with the new...everything's Fresh.\" For some, a change in Tye Tribbett's artistry will be a source of discomfort. But for most, the album will represent a fresh and exciting new season of change and expression from one of Gospel music's most charismatic figures.\n", "val": 0.02236797846853733}

{"text": "This album is a perfect example of a band who takes its musical cues from existing artists, jumbles them up and tries to present itself as fresh and new and, heaven forbid, ORIGINAL.  Young the Giant doesn't have an original bone in their bodies (no pun intended).  Do you really know why the song \"Cough Syrup\" is so catchy and ear-wormy?  It's because its first verse shares the exact same melody as the verse to Scottish new-wavers Altered States' \"I Could Be Happy\" from (gasp) 1982!!!  If you don't believe me, check it out by listening to the sample before buying.  In fact, most of the song \"Cough Syrup\" is a mashup of \"Happy\" crossed with about 90% of the Cocteau Twins entire oeuvre.  I'm still waiting for YTG to perform it on some music awards show and bring out \"Super-Special guest\" Liz Fraser after the first verse and chorus.  Then Ms. Fraser would warble the second verse in her inimitable, almost incomprehensible, style and the audience would go nuts.  But that would never happen in a million because that would show YTG to be the sham they are.  And that second airplay hit, \"My Body\" sounds like a cross between the Smiths (or at least Morrissey's solo stuff) and the band James (\"Laid\"/\"Sit Down\").  If you like those two song, download them singularly.  Don't waste $$ on the whole album, it's all too derivative and done before.\n", "val": 5.7908899179892614e-05}

{"text": "Technically a sophomore recording (this group has previously released an EP under the band name The Jakes) these young musicians have released a self-titled album that sounds mature, original, and sure-footed.  It is clearly the product of a band that will be filling concert venues and playlists for years to come.Sameer Gadhia is a vocal force to be reckoned with.  He is a dark-timbred baritenor with a wide and effortless range.  He has an uncanny ability to blend energetic rock and legato jazz-esque vocals.  His is one of those voices that helps Young The Giant achieve a distinct sound.  He ranks as a personal favorite among modern male vocalists, together with the likes of Nate Ruess of the band Fun.With regard to the songwriting, it is expert.  I write with particular attention to the Special Edition, including the new songs \"Every Little Thing\" and \"Typhoon.\"  I stand by the statement that \"Typhoon\" is probably the best song Young The Giant has written.  It is essentially a duet with Ghadia as lead and Comtois in the bridge and choruses.  Harmonies like this are hard to find these days.  The feel of the song is similar to \"God Made Man\" in that it begins slowly and softly and develops naturally into something bigger: soft guitars and a quiet piano solo eventually give way to an electric bass and crashing drums, but all while maintaining its lyricism.  With a non-standard tuning for the guitars, the interesting key progressions in the verses, and use of triple time, this all makes \"Typhoon\" a rather unique listening experience.The album takes a breather from the high-intensity tracks with \"God Made Man\" as the albums mid-point.  The development of this through-composed song is astonishing coming from such a young group of musicians.  It starts as a tranquil, easy-going piece, and develops into a forceful, extended coda, with a lyrical bass supporting rock-inspired vocals: \"I want you to know...\"The standout track (besides Cough Syrup) is \"I Got.\"  The catchy triple meter, precision percussion played by Francois Comtois, and a pair of guitars seemingly in dialogue with each other, together with vocal harmonies in the chorus, evince high quality musicianship from all of the members.  It is natural sounding and free-flowing.\"Cough Syrup\" is one of their first songs.  It was previously released when the band was called The Jakes on an EP called \"Shake My Hand.\"  Among the additions to the present version was a solo cello in the introduction and cleaner harmonies in the instruments.  \"Garands at Normandie\" is also a reissue from their days as The Jakes, adding a brand new intro and coda (it originally had an intro for acoustic guitar).  The result is a more mature and confident sound.The follow up album \"Mind Over Matter\" is equally recommended, espousing a more hardened, rock-inspired sound.  They both come highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.02971416525542736}

There's nothing wrong with a catchy record that relies on hooks; not every alt band is trying to be Pavement.On the flip side, the 2nd half of the album does lose a considerable amount of steam.

Sameer Gadhia's (the lead singer) voice is so unique, distinguishable and incredible!

Young the Giant is well-known for their major hits 'My Body' and 'Cough Syrup,' but unlike many other debut albums I've purchased, every track on it is just as good as their hits if not better. There is not a single song that I skip over and I've been listening to it for years now. Each song is different and has a unique feel, but still manages to keep the same YTG style throughout. If you ever get the chance to see them live, I greatly advise doing so. I saw them in concert and they did not disappoint. Lead vocalist Sameer Gadhia has a very distinctive and flawless voice, but the band does not rely solely on him. Each musician is extremely talented and would be able to hold his own individually, but together they are perfect. Overall, this is an amazing album that deserves to be on your playlist.

{"text": "Let me guess, you discovered this band through their song \"Cough Syrup\" huh? Well either way, let me tell you about Young the Giant. No I haven't researched them. I don't know who they are or where they're from. I'm guessing somewhere in the U.K. though because they have a slightly British sound. There's not much synth the be found here - mostly guitars, drums, and bass. It's real music.They sound a bit like Maroon 5 or The Script meets Snow Patrol, vega4, or Coldplay. There's a passion and energy to a lot of these songs. There's a fair amount of variety between the tracks as well. Garands is probably one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It reminds me a bit of U2 or Peter Gabriel at their best, and every time it comes on in my mix, it stops me in my tracks.Not every track on this album is equally strong. Some seem a bit dry or derivative, but almost every album has its filler right? That said, the majority of what you find here is top quality, with the top three tracks being \"Cough Syrup\", \"Garands\", and \"Guns Out\". None of it is bad - each song ranges from 3-5 stars, with most hitting 4 stars easily. At their best, their music has a passionate, driving quality to it, with underlying dreamy, haunting overtones.

{"text": "My late father was a P-38 Pilot in WWII, \"flew a desk\" at a logistics depot in Japan during Korea, and helped keep the Russian bear at bay in Europe during the Cold War.I believe this album was given to him when we were living in Weisbaden Germany in early 1960's. I can still recall my mother covering my nine-year-old ears when we put it on Hi-Fi for the first time. She's 92 now, and I have downloaded a few of her favorite tracks to remind her of old times. It's easy to imagine my Dad singing any of these songs with the boys at the Officer's Club bar in England in 1942, or in Japan in 1952.These are not patriotic numbers. They're funny and sardonic and demonstrate how fighting airmen used to (and probably still do) blow off steam at regulations, \"the brass\", and the hazards of flying. They tell of friendly rivalries between fighter pilots and bomber pilots, between regulars and reservists, and between pilots and the guys in the control tower. There's also plenty of verse about the off-duty pursuit of women and another round of drinks.Oscar Brand is a great figure in American Folk Music. He performed with Woodie Guthry, Pete Seeger, Leadbelly and the Weavers. He had a long career in broadcasting and collected hundreds of historical and vernacular songs into this and other notable albums. The arrangements of \"Wild Blue\" are much like The Weavers, with guitar, banjo and vocal harmony. Brand sings the lead with real feeling for the humor and irony with which military pilots lament boast of their exploits and complain about the lousy chow.There's a good article on how this album was inspired, titled \"Out of the Blue\", written by John Starr. The original appeared in The Smithsonian's Air & Space magazine in 1997.

Personally, I am a big fan of theirs, but for someone who may not be familiar with their music, I give it a high recommendation.... especially, if you like calm and light indie rock music, in general. Simply due to the fact, that it is easy going and relaxing music. The seller from which I purchased was very quick in shipping and the quality of the product I received, I was quite pleased with. It arrived in shrink wrap and didn't have any dents or bends luckily.This particular one, which I bought includes 12 songs and is not the special edition, with three bonus tracks. Although, inside of the album there was a interesting and artsy sort of poster/photo included, that was the size of the lp, so that was a nice little bonus. Overall, definitely worth every cent.Only thing I would like to additionally add, is that I do think they are better in their sound, performing live. For someone unfamiliar with their music, I advise using google as a tool to find some live videos of theirs....

Young the Giant is different, however.  They have soul.  Listening to them is like listening to an early version of Interpol.  I feel they haven't found their sound yet but their experimentation seeking it is beautiful.  The music is at times sporadic and despondent.  I love how they play their guitars off beat at times and how they can shift their songs to be quiet, loud and thematic, but also pensive when it needs to be.  Sameer's vocals are full of soul and really drive the music.  Since the indie music golden age of 2004-2005, I haven't found much music I obsess over, but this is my new obsession from a handful of new albums I consider worthy of further listening..\n", "val": 0.013247227296233177}

It's been a while since a band has completely surprised me with a terrific album and earned a spot in my list of favorite bands (Jimmy Eat World and Death Cab are the only 2000's mainstays) As a child of the 1990's, it seems all my favorite bands like Foo Fighters and Green Day are the only bands still currently putting out good rock and alternative music. From the sound of their debut album, Young The Giant will be taking on the mantra of awesome and unpretentious alternative music for the 2010's. For some reason, this album reminds me a little of the great Brendan Benson, and EARLY Maroon 5 (Songs about Jane...not their subsequent pop crap). The album feels fresh and original, and aside from the singles, check out Garands (my fav), and 12 fingers. And just to make the sell even further, sign up for Spotify if you can, and stream the album, then feel incredibly guilty you got to listen to it for free and go buy it!\n", "val": 0.03295241668820381}

{"text": "While trudging along on one of my usual sampling escapades through the countless new artists here on Amazon.com I stumbled upon Young the Giant with a sudden sense of surprise and instant curiosity. My first song sample was \"I Got\" I recall. And I was immediately struck by how the singer Sameer Gadhia sounded a great deal like The Guess Who's great Burton Cummings. I was profoundly impressed as most of the new artists whose samples I had perused were mostly homogonous, uninspired, melodically challenged, and frankly, forgettable. I dug into more of Young the Giant, all the while with mouth agape and a frozen expression of pure delight.With any great find that I have ever stumbled upon in popular music, it has always been the case that I could hear many different artists styles reflected in these new works. And I did listen to this band with an open ear. Alongside the Burton Cummings style, I could also relate sounds and styles to The Cutting Crew, Sting, White Lies, and the Killers - all of whom are great representations of solid songwriting with strong melodic structure that is pleasing to the ear.Certainly, with any new band's debut album there is a general lack of continuity and thematic adherence. It seems that every debut album is a somewhat eclectic collection of years of prior writings meant to showcase an artist's versatility - and Young the Giant certainly shows a solid amount of versatility compared to its current peers.Being a child of the seventies and eighties, I am naturally resistant and extremely critical of most music released after 1989 - okay I AM a dinosaur of sorts. But honestly, I have not heard a lot of music since that meets up to the artistry and craft of those released way back when. Young the Giant is one of those rare bands that have burst through the radar to land into my very selective music collection. Young the Giant is a easy listen. There is a warm feeling behind the songs and a sense of melody and charm that is rarely seen in other bands of this new era of \"ring-tone-ready\" music production.I most certainly believe this band will be around for quite some time. As far as Young the Giant's debut release goes... I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing this album - this is an introduction to a band that may very well represent a positive change in the industry!\n", "val": 0.010640143416821957}

Gone is the big ballad and in its place is a slower, more intimate love song that still retains Buble's signature crooning voice (thankfully not as over-the-top as it can get on the faster numbers).  The best way I can describe the feeling of listening to this compared to the Manilow version is that the latter sounds generic; this sounds like it's being sung to someone the singer has in mind or at the very least, in a small club instead of an arena.From the rather simple start of a piano and string set to the swelling ending of a bigger band accompaniment, this is absolutely the best version, and I say that as a closet Manilow fan.\n", "val": 0.015814973041415215}

The chorus sounds unoriginal to me, but it's nice to listen to.Cough Syrup: (5/5) Their most popular song, understandably so.  Amazing lyrics and melody, \"Life's too short to even care at all\".God Made Man: (4/5) One of those songs that will go under the radar, but, nonetheless this song is good.

At first it sounds bland, but it's \"okay\".Islands: (4/5) Their slowest and softest song.  It's delicate and beautiful.Guns Out: (4/5) A great way to end an album.

{"text": "I don't know how I missed this album from the So. Cal-based Young the Giant last year, but better later than never I suppose. I stumbled onto this album about a month ago, and I've been playing this a LOT.\"Young the Giant\" (11 tracks; 51 min.) starts off with \"Apartment\" (which was released as a vinyl single), and it's an okay starter. But then we delve into the meat of the album, with strong tracks following one after another: the guitar heavy \"My Body\" (radio dingle), the melodic \"I Got\" and then \"Cough Syrup\" (radio single), several tracks reminding me of early Coldplay. The near-perfect first half of the album concludes with \"God Made Man\" and \"12 Fingers\", with the latter containing an irresistable sing-along chorus, just beautiful. The second half of the album slows things down a bit at times, although contains several outstanding songs like the epic-sounding \"Garands\". The last 2 tracks of the album \"Islands\" and \"Guns Out\" again remind my of Coldplay era-Parachutes (one of my all-time favorite albums).In all, what a fantastic debut album. Dreamy at times, hard charging at times, and always keeping my interest. It would've surely made my \"best of\" 2011 albums had I discovered it earlier. That aside, I had the good fortune of seeing YTG in concert this past weekend here in Cincinnati, and they put on a fabulous 75 min. set, playing many of these tracks, along with a few new ones (can't wait for their next album!).

The next time you hear a person say \"good music is dead, it is no longer made and artists have stopped making refreshing music\" ask them to shut up and if they're worth it, recommend them this band.This is going to be one of the more difficult reviews I've written. Young the Giant remind me of a few of my favourite artists but in truth they sound like none of them, not even half like Incubus when they were still making good music. It has been several years since I have heard a band that allows itself to love their music so much that you can almost hear it in their voice, their rhythm and the lyrics (er, amusing to say the least). It was \"Islands\" that caught my attention first. After several listens to the album, I concluded that the album playlist is just perfect. It starts off with Apartment where Sameer's vocals just outshine and announce the most delicate and unobtrusive of beginners to any album. The chorus is so catchy, it won't leave you. \"I hit the sidewalk and this is how it starts.\"God Made Man is an outstanding song. It starts off really mellow with very well weighted guitars and the vocalist punches you in the face before referring to the God-awesome chorus. You gotta hear it to hear it.\"Cough Syrup\" and \"Islands\" are some of my other favourite songs. The most remarkable thing about Islands is that you will miss it when it is not playing. The song seems to somehow leave you with a lot in a very short span and the listener feels they heard more than that was sung. \"The way you move a foreign groove at night.\" Sublime.YOUNG THE GIANT is successful because they sing in present-tense and the music never sounds whiny.

I owe amazon for my discoveries of such amazing artists as Ray LaMontagne and The Black Keys, and now I must add Young the Giant to that list. I usually don't take the time to write a review for anything, as it takes some kind of miraculous occurrence to compel me to shell out the 200 words or so. This band is truly amazing. I don't use that word lightly. I love everything about this album. It's so original, intricate, polished. To say it is better than 99% of today's music is an understatement. These guys really have something different. I'm really hoping that this is only the beginning for them, because talent like this deserves recognition. Don't fall into the \"My Body\" trap and just buy the mp3. That isn't even the best song on the album, albeit a good one. My favorite song from this album is \"I Got.\" It is just so much fun!

{"text": "First off let me say I have loved this band since their first album. Default managed to do something VERY few bands ever do. They hit it out of the ball park not once, not twice....but three times with their first 3 albums.Anybody will tell you that is not an easy feat. And so it comes as no surprise to me that they finally released a less than steller album.I gave this album 2 stars...but would have given it 2 1/2 if I could have. It's not that the album is AWFUL...it's ok.  But when you compare it to the 3 that came before....there is no comparison.Comes and Goes is DREDFULLY SLOW!  It's not at all head on rock and roll like all of their prior work.  Until this album they had always been a band that would have the majority of their album be harder material with the 2-3 slower paced songs along for the ride.  And even the slow ones sounded good due to the production and mixing.This album is the opposite.  There MAY be 3 faster tempo songs...the rest are all slower in pace.  That might not be so bad if it were not for the AWFUL mixing and production.  Dallas Smith has a spectacular voice....but it is all but gone on this album...and it's due to the way it is mixed.  Sometimes I caught myself in pure awe of how flat and unspectacular his voice came off on this album.It took me months to snag this album at a decent price due to it not being released in the states....I can honestly say...I know why it was not released here.This is NOT Default. This is Default lite.I will wait patiently for their next offering...I still have faith in them, after those first 3 albums who would not?BUT...I hope they ditch this producer and get a new mixer as well....AND keep the tempo at a faster pace.TRAPT did the exact same thing on their last album..slowed it to a crawl.If anybody wants this album at a cheap price...I'll be listing my copy on Ebay very soon!\n", "val": 4.697474651038647e-05}

Sadly, great albums likes this somehow get ignored. It's not like this is avant-garde stuff either! This is just great radio-friendly, true blue rock 'n' roll music! If some of these songs were given some airtime they'd be sure-fire hits. Reluctantly it doesn't seem likely that'll happen. Trust me though folks, if you ever liked Default, if you liked \"Wasting My Time\" then buy this album! You'll love it!

I saw where this guy had real potential and was about to give it a 4 star rating.  So why did I give it five stars?  That move was due to tracks 9-14.  These selections were, for me, the strongest of his effort.

My favorite songs are probably Chain Reaction (got some spin on the radio ... Steve Harvey's \"jam\" for a while), You Got That Magic and Can't Wait.  Honestly though, this is definitely one of those albums you can throw on and let it play from start to finish.Really not sure why he didn't get more radio play.

If I were to compare him anyone it would be to the likes of Raheem DeVaugh and DeAngelo.

Sheperd also exhibited great character while interacting with others during the evening. I was determined to find out who he was because I'd never heard of him before that night. Imagine how pleased I was to open my email to find an Amazon ad promoting his debut album. I listened to all of the sound-track samples and I purchased the album. I really enjoy the selections, and recommend the album to others; it is quite enjoyable. I do not think that the album goes far enough, however, in show-casing this guy's immense talent and range.

{"text": "If I am correct in reffering to this cd as a debut album, it's pretty impressive.  I agree with the comparisons to Linkin park and Hollywood Undead, but these guys feel unique enough to set them apart from other bands.  Throughout listening to this album, I felt like the music kept genre-bending, in a good way.  Some of it feels like Nine Inch Nails, and some of it comes close to hardcore psychopathic rapping.  The great quality about this cd is that it has variety within its production.  The producer definately took much much time into making each song stand out from one another, while still being the same kind of badass.I only have a few criticisms.  These being the brooding depressing feeling hanging over the album, and the lack in lyrical complexity.  These two items weren't enough to dislike the album, but Numb is a stretch before perfect.  Their sophmore album just needs a couple introducing songs that blow it up, before they take it to a somber level.  Also Tac and Hash, while having nice flows, they need some complicated verses.  Rhyming body with somebody is like cheating in poker to me.  They're off to a great start, but they can use so much more out of this potential.Aside from the minor negative feelings I have for the album, some pieces of it just connect with me on a huge level.  \"Take This Away\" is my personal favorite, the song of which sounds like a dope homage to the 28 Days Later theme.  The drum beat and piano notes on that songs are badass as hell.  The production on songs like \"My Song,\" \"Beautiful,\" and \"Never that Far Away\" is sick.  I hope to see more of that in the future.Numb is a great start for Abica.  They have established their sound and style without making it a rough draft.  They have a lot of room to grow, which could be a good thing or bad thing depending on how you interpret it.  I connect much more on an instrumental level than I do with Tac and Hash, but if all the elements come to a full potential, then I think we have ourselves a dope ass sophmore album. The first thing that came to mind when I listened to Abica was \"It sounded like they listened to Project Deadman, and thought 'Wouldn't it be so much doper if he did this'?\"  And then they put it on a CD and owned it.\n", "val": 0.006656647194176912}
{"text": "I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, \"Numb\":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.  Tac has stated:  \"...it's a snapshot of our generation right now.  The way a lot of us feel in a time of war, technology, pain and love.  It's easy to feel dissociated and NUMB to all the chaos we call life today.\"  I have felt this way, but I haven't articulated it, even to myself.  ABiCA's lyrics reflect this state of affairs, and musically they draw on various influences. The main ones I notice are Linkin Park, Hollywood Undead and of course, Eminem.The lyrics cover the whole range of problems - political, personal and social. The title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album: \"If everything that mattered to me is now gone...Now take a closer look and tell me what you see.\"  Track 2, \"Tell Us Why\", continues with the directly political: \"We are underground...Before you say goodbye, you've got to tell us why.\"  Things get more personal in \"Turn Me On\", which seems to be about people questioning one's route to self-satisfaction.  In \"My Song\" and \"The Things You Think I Say\", the anguish is over failed relationships.  \"The Pursuit\" has the lines \"Just let me in...If I get the chance to play, I think you'll want me to stay.\"  \"Beautiful\" has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times:  \"You're beautiful, so {CENSORED} beautiful...I'd be a little more complete if I just had you.\"  \"Just Another\", \"Never That Far Away\" and \"Nothing Here\" are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense, demanding and hypocritical.As for musical influences, there are elements other than the ones I mentioned above which are noticeable. Three of the tracks open with melodic, solemn piano, which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious.  \"I Can Be Real\" and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of, say, Nine-Inch Nails.  \"Gave 'Em A Reason\" opens with dance music elements, then includes some excellent guitar work, both grungy and psychedelic - a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic, spiritual, up, and grunge is depressing, scary, down.  Several tracks have a synth-string background that gives them a more mainstream sound.  \"Just Another\" includes military-style drumming and Army-march lingo.Release from numbness comes in the final track \"What You See\", with an ironic twist.  They sing, \"Open up your eyes...Nothing more to hide...now the time has come/And all this goes away, and I'm not {CENSORED} NUMB...Look around, NOTHING EVER HEALS THE PAIN.\" The irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them.  It could almost be an 80's pop-rock track, and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting.  Hmmmm...The album is full of explicit language (which I had to censor in this review), so if you are one of those people who can't take that, by all means stay away.  But if you are OK with free expression, you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for a while.\n", "val": 0.0075182789005339146}

{"text": "I recently attended an exclusive screening of the \"I Am... World Tour\" in New York City, and let me tell you - it made my YEAR. Not only does the film capture some of the greatest performances of her career, but it also shows intimate behind-the-scenes footage woven into the concert! From the second Beyonc's concert began, both the London crowd and even us were cheering louder than ever. It seems strange... we treated it like an actual concert. Well, Beyonc did tell us to when she went on stage just before the screening. Enough of the screening, let's get to the actual film!Beyonc gives us her all in this film. Perhaps the true highlights of the concert are the performances of \"Crazy in Love\" (which had a special appearance from Jay-Z), \"Smash into You,\" \"Broken-Hearted Girl,\" \"Ave Maria\"... I could list the entire set-list, but that wouldn't be much of a review, would it? In terms of her performance I give a 100 out of 10! :PAs for the editing and all that good stuff, it was also fantastic. Sure, things got a little grainy at times, but what do you expect to see when a camera zooms in? There was also a lot of times I asked myself, \"Is Beyonc the only one on stage?\" I'd like to have seen more of her band, dancers, and background singers performing. A perfect example of this was during \"Crazy in Love.\" Just before the song ends, Beyonc and her dancers do a heavy routine. I just found it strange how we could only see Beyonc's FACE as she moved.One other aspect of editing I want to point out is the cuts after pretty much each performance. Beyonc isn't faster than the speed of light. It takes her time, like anyone else, to change clothing. The instances where her band does solo performances, as well as the Mamas, have been cut. Of course, there are clips from her personal life during these cuts, and I actually attended the concert, so you really shouldn't notice.I know it seems like I'm talking more about the negative, but I'd be writing a novel if I mentioned all the good... no, GREAT in this film.All in all, I give the film HIGHER than a perfect score. Editing, maybe a four and fifteen-sixteenths out of five. I don't actually own the DVD, but the main concert itself is all you need for this thing to sell. I'll probably add more to this review once I actually get my hands on the release, but for now, this will do. If the CD, bonus features, and booklet are anything like the film, I'm definitely sold! :D\"If you're having a damn, good time, say 'yeah!'\" ~ Beyonc, \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\"\n", "val": 0.008260861039161682}

This Dvd comes with all of her biggest hits packed into a truly thrilling experience. She gives her all with powerful vocals, top notch choreography and a great stage that is just fun to look at.

{"text": "I saw several reviews from Beyonce fans that did not particualy like the way this DVD was edited and Beyonce's Vlog diary that constanly interruppted the performances.  Most of the reviews stated that Beyonce Experience DVD was far better than Beyonce I am world tour DVD.My take, I have all three tour DVD's now, I have never been to a live concert. After viewing this DVD in it's entirety, I would have to say that I enjoyed 95% of the DVD. The remaining 5% that I did not like was due to the Vlog's that kept stopping the performance. It wasn't a HUGE flaw in my opinion but the DVD could have did without the Beyonce Vlogs.What I did like was the performances, costumes, dancers, stage araangements and Beyonce's energy was FIRE!!I will have to adnmit that I like Beyonce Experience better than this DVD. I understand that Beyonce may have included her thoughts on her career and her life in this DVD, but I'm sorry to say that I still have a lack of knowledge of who Beyonce really is, yes I know her as a performer but in my opinion Beyonce is extremely private and very much to herself 100% of the time. She doesnt really hang out with people outside her circle and she gives very little information about herself during interviews.But all in all I love Beyonce the performer!

She is a consummate performer, beloved by millions across the globe! This is not a small feat. On this DVD, she finally let's down her guard about her love & passion for Jay-Z (in small doses of course), but quite endearing. She is a visionary, professional and very impressive for such a young woman. This set is worth purchasing for those who adore her as an artist AND those who admire her work ethic/professionalism.

{"text": "Beyonce is one of the most talented female musicians of my generation. And it just goes to show that hard work and dedication can lead you into super stardom. And she proves it with this amazing DVD. Although there are some things that I did and didn't like.One thing that the Beyonce Experience DVD got right is that it broad casted the entire show without interruptions or being edited down. The thing it lacked were special features and behind the scenes of the amazing tour.The I Am World Tour is the exact opposite. It gives us those behind the scenes that we yearn for, but edits and chops the hell out of a good show.Here are my pros and cons.Pros:-Beyonce's performances never disappoint. When you buy a concert ticket, watch her at an award show, or purchase DVD of her concert, you know you're going to be entertained.-Crazy in Love, Smash Into You, If I Were a Boy and Halo are my personal favorite performances from the concert.-The special features are pretty cool. You see the hard work it takes to put on a show like this, and how Beyonce doesn't take any crap when it comes to her show!-The choreography, staging, costumes and overall atmosphere-Her band is freaking bananas! Every song sounds better then the recording.-The little interludes between songs help keep the pace of the DVD.And although I don't have that many Pros, they are all worth enough to make me rate this DVD 4 stars!Cons:-The SONGS ARE EDITED! I personally rather see the whole performance of Freakum Dress, Ego, Say My Name, Radio etc.  For a concert DVD I would like to see performances in their full. The fact that completing these songs would probably only add just 5 more minutes to the DVD shows how unnecessary the cuts are. Even half of Kanye West's verse in Ego is cut off.-Beyonce is edited to appear super human. The bulk of the footage is from Beyonce's I am World Tour filmed in London's O2 Arena for two nights. And while watching most of the videos on YouTube from fans you can clearly tell that most of the audio is from the first night and most of the film is from the second night. They even edit her to doing a backbend for 20 seconds when in reality she did it for 5. Or even edit her doing 20 flips when she probably did ten at best.-Why is Sweet Dreams not apart of this DVD when it was filmed on the same night, yet Upgrade U and At Last appear?-Its really short. Its only like 1hr and 30 Minutes. And since the show is paced very fast, with 25 different songs, it goes by really fast.Overall I feel like Beyonce gets it, but doesn't get it at the same time. Its like B'Day all over again. I feel like I'm getting a half assed product so that I'd buy a Super Special Ultimate Deluxe Edition five months from now. Still a great concert, great performance, but its lacking in some areas.\n", "val": 0.007530728820711374}

{"text": "I've been a Third Day fan since their third disc \"Time\" & never thought they would better it, but I'm proved wrong here.  Everytime I think they're going to come out with one that's not quite up to par, they surprise & surpass my expectations.  \"Move\" is no exception.  On one listen, I absolutely think it's their best disc yet.  In fact, I think it's the best disc of 2010 by ANY artist.  New levels of depth are explored with the strings & soulful blues injected with rich backing vocals courtesy of The Blind Boys of Alabama on the opening track & each time you think you've heard what will be the best track, another one follows which seems to be as good or better.  There will be no disappointment in purchasing this; a sure-fire winner from front to back!  Kudos to these guys for making the best Christian music on the planet!!

{"text": "I'm relatively new to Third Day, but as soon as I found them, I devoured all their music.... I thought Revelation was incredible, and Offerings II blew me away. However, Move has taken it to a whole 'nother level. There isn't a bad song on the album. I literally cannot stop listening to this cd; I have it on at work, on my commute on the train, in the car and at home. If you're a fan of Third Day, you MUST get this album - you won't be disappointed!!!\n", "val": 0.010331799276173115}
{"text": "I can't add much to excellent reviews such as the one posted by Kevin R. Davis (though all six thus far seem on point).  Third Day's most recent offering, \"Move,\" is indeed one of their best.  I agree that \"Move\" returns to Third Day's Southern rock roots.  It also continues their history of rich, Gospel-centered lyrics.  I've enjoyed and been encouraged by Third Day for years and would recommend numerous of their albums and songs.  \"Move\" will probably claim several of my top Third Day song recommendations, though.  Like Mr. Davis, \"Trust in Jesus\" is my favorite song of this new album, with \"Surrender\" and \"Lift Up Your Face\" as close top choices.  I disagree with one minor point of one of the other reviews in that the song \"Children of God\" seems right at home on this album, both musically and in light of its strong, hopeful, spiritual message.  If you want to learn more about \"Move\" and its message, you should visit Third Day's website (under \"Music\" > \"Recent Project\") and read the band's comments on the album, including its background.  I hope that you'll agree and be moved by the same hopeful message of Third Day's \"Move.\"\n", "val": 0.02513928897678852}
{"text": "By far this is Third Days best effort yet. I would not be surprised if \"Surrender\" crosses over into the mainstream charts.

Perhaps a lot of help from the carpenter created this this work of art that will absolutely \"stir your soul\" as great music should.

{"text": "After ten studio albums, as well as a collection of live recordings and videos, collaborations, and worship projects larger than most artists' entire careers, it is easy to be cautiously optimistic about Third Day's latest, titled \"Move.\" Indeed, it also marks the Atlanta Christian rock supergroup's first album entirely absent of former guitarist Brad Avery's frenzied and chaotic fretwork. Lacking the musician that turned the group from a local act to an internationally-known rock band, and writing music for almost two full decades, it seems likely that the band would be completely devoid of originality at this point. I am much obliged to say that there is nothing further from the truth with \"Move.\"Third Day kicks the album off with single \"Lift Up Your Face\" by enlisting the gritty vocals of the Blind Boys of Alabama to backdrop a massive, layered sound-scape with the raw energy of a thermonuclear warhead. It is clear from this point that this is like no other Third Day album before it, yet, strangely, this is like every other Third Day album before it. The Southern feel of \"Time.\" The energy of \"Wire.\" The lyrical honesty of \"Wherever You Are.\" The vocal prowess of \"Revelation.\" It's all here in spades - and in many respects, in greater portion sizes. Nothing is subtle about the album - from start until finish, the band asks straightforward questions about their faith (\"Make Your Move,\" \"Surrender\") and provides straightforward answers to every one of them (\"Lift Up Your Face,\" \"What Have You Got To Lose\"). Further, they are not too proud to simply stop and just praise Jesus (\"Children of God,\" \"Trust in Jesus\"). It is actually refreshing to hear the lyrical honesty here because it simply fits it's \"Bible-belt\" sound perfectly, which Third Day has perfected. Songs like \"Make Your Move\" and \"Gone\" are hardly complicated but have heavy and infectious Southern rock grooves, while songs like \"Trust In Jesus\" and \"Sound of Your Voice\" are perfect examples of how a rock ballad should be done. \"Everywhere You Go\" strikes an interesting blend of Skynyrd-like guitar riffs and poppish melodies that, oddly enough, works well enough to become a surprise album highlight. \"Surrender\" builds from slide and acoustic guitars into a powerful mix of electric guitars and orchestrated strings, held together by a pleasantly loose, bluesy melody; by far, it is is the most epic-sounding Third Day track ever recorded. \"I'll Be Your Miracle\" flirts with a country twang without completely adopting the genre's cliches. The band obviously refuses to adopt modern pop-rock sensibilities and instead crafts an album that is dated by design. It harms not the project - it achieves a classic sound yet remains fresh due to the fantastic production quality.In fact, the only track here that makes a misstep is \"Children of God,\" which uses a children's choir to further convey it's already crystal-clear message. Not that this is a terrible thing, it's just an overused concept in Christian music that is disappointing to hear from such seasoned veterans of the industry. However, when the only complaint one can throw at an album is that one aspect of one song sounds a bit out of place, it speaks great things about an album. \"Move\" is as near to flawless as is humanly possible and sits at the top of Third Day's massive library as a \"greatest hits\" album - made from scratch in a brand new studio with a brand new producer and minus a guitarist. With two whole strikes against it, \"Move\" hits out of the park and into the stratosphere. Put this one right up there with dc Talk's \"Jesus Freak,\" Audio Adrenaline's \"Bloom,\" Newsboys' \"Take Me To Your Leader\" - I don't care. Just put it somewhere and listen to it for the next fifteen years. \"Move\" is here to stay.Ten-point Scale: 9.5 out of 10Genre: Christian Rock / Southern RockObjectionable Content: NoneRecommended: Highly\n", "val": 0.005141494330018759}
{"text": "This is a great new release, of Third Day's unique brand of Southern Christian Rock. Third Day is from Atlanta, and I noticed they included \"ATL.GA\", on the front cover of this CD. I've seen this band perform live, in Bossier City, Louisiana, on their \"Live Revelations\" Tour, and they are fantastic. This CD is full of great songs, of praise, worship and encouragement. Featured songs as listed on the label, include, \"Lift Up Your Face\", \"Children of God\", and \"Surrender\". These are indeed great songs, and are certainly destined to become major hits on Contemporary Christian Radio Stations. Some may even cross over into the rock & pop charts, just as some of Third Day's prior songs have.This album is featured as more of a contemporary, Christian Rock, album, with a \"Southern\" sound, than a \"Praise & Worship\" Album, such as the \"Offerings\" series. It's certainly a fantastic album, full of great songs, with great gospel messages. I really love it.Overall, this is another great one, from Third Day. If you like Third Day, Contemporary Christian Music, Praise & Worship Music, and/or Southern Rock, then you should really enjoy this CD. Thanks and May God Bless!!!P.S. I attended a Third Day Concert, last night,(March 18, 2011) in Monroe, Louisiana, on their \"Make Your Move Tour\". \"Wow\", what a treat!!!! It was awesome!!!! They really \"Rocked\" the University of Louisiana at Monroe's Coliseum. The place was packed, the crowd was really \"into it\", and Third Day, certainly delivered one \"Super-Outstanding\" Concert. They featured songs from this new album \"Move\", plus some of their classics, & some requests from the audience. One of their songs (\"Born Again\" from their \"Revelation\" Album), was selected to be in a major, movie, entitled \"7 Days in Utopia\", to be released later this year. We got to see a preview of this movie, at the concert. Also, the band promoted their \"Southern Rock\", style. I bought a cap that has \"Atlanta, GA, Third Day, Est. 1992, Original Rock & Roll Quality\".  Also, I bought a T-Shirt that has an  Eagle logo, & Third Day \"Move\" logo, on the front, and it has a logo on the back, with the words: \"Pure Southern Rock & Roll\". So, they are proud of & promoting  their \"Southern Christian Rock\", music style. If you get a chance to attend a concert on this 40 city tour, please by all means, attend, you'll love it, and be blessed. I LOVE THIS BAND!!!! MAY GOD BLESS THIRD DAY!!! THANKS AGAIN!!!\n", "val": 0.03207044675946236}
{"text": "As a fan of Third Day who first watched them perform in Medford, Oregon way back in October of 1996 I must give my 2 cents on Third Day's new album MOVE:The choir, the orchestra, the HEAVY southern rock sound, the great addition of a banjo, the brilliant praise and worship, the amazing voice of Mac Powell and the catchy hooks of Dr Mark Lee make this Third Day album THE best! I am personally a fan of the albums \"Wherever You Are\" \"TIME\" and \"Revelation\" so this album is an excellent mix of the three. I also must point out that's it's wonderful that \"JESUS\" is back in \"Christian rock music.\" So many bands in the Christian industry have simply become inspirational bands so it's nice that Third Day doesn't hesitate on mentioning Jesus in their music.David Carr and Tai Anderson have the perfect sound on this record! The bass and the drums always stand out and the mix is just perfect. It honestly reminds me of the great rhythm section featured on Jars of Clay's \"Much Afraid\" album.Dr. Mark Lee shines on this album! I honestly think he has more of those little guitar solos then on any other Third Day album.Mac Powell...can the guy get any better? Honestly, this is by far the best work he has ever done! His voice is more southerner then ever and his writing is some of the best work he has ever done.And the choir....WOW! This is something new for Third Day and it works! Now you would think that a choir and a southern rock sound wouldn't work but it honestly sounds great!Children of God, Surrender and Trust in Jesus are by far the greatest Third Day songs ever recorded! Adding the children's choir on Children of God was a nice little treat and gave the song a wonderful ending. I also must point out that the last portion of \"Surrender\" reminded me of one of Metallica's songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (yes, I like all kinds of music).As for the bad (and every album has it) a couple of the songs sound the same and a few of the songs end very abruptly. The idea of adding the Blind Boys of Alabama on Lift Up Your Face is just okay with me, I do love the song but the Blind Boys just don't match up with the sound.All in all this albums just works, some of the meatiest stuff Third Day has ever put out (TIME is a close second). If you enjoy Audio Adrenaline, Switchfoot, Jars of Clay, Styx, U2, Bon Jovi, or Lynyrd Skynyrd then you will love this album!One finale note: Third Day is coming up on nearly 20 years of Christian Music Ministry, something that very few bands have accomplished (Petra, Newsboys, uuummm...). Here is my question, will Third Day end the Ministry as the headliner or will they keep on going until they are performing for little crowds as has-beens? The song \"Gone\" makes you wonder.\n", "val": 0.03333666920661926}

{"text": "Third Day has released its 11th studio album, \"Move.\" With members Mac Powell, Mark Lee,Tai Anderson and David Carr playing some melodic and powerful tunes, the lyrics apply not only to hardcore believers but also to Christians whose faith isn't as strong.The band's message challenges the church to be a place of faith moving in a physical world. Although it has been 15 years since Third Day released its debut album, the band continues to grow and has become one of the best rock and worship bands in Christian music.The first track on the album, \"Lift Up Your Face,\" is bound to be a hit and is already climbing the charts. A rock ballad that give an encouraging message, the song was written for the hard times and insecurity our country is going through: \"You have fallen so far now. You don't even know how you are going to survive. Just above the horizon a new light is shining, breaking through the darkest night. Love is coming and it's calling out your name.\"\"Move\" delivers some soulful country and rock songs. Third Day maintains its edgy sound but also its worship focus, both musically and lyrically.\"Trust in Jesus\" is one of the best songs on the album. The song speaks in a straightforward way about the need to be a follower of Christ and have faith in Him. The song is easy to sing along to, and it has a simple yet profound message.Overall, \"Move\" is an album that Third Day fans -- young and old -- will love from the first listen. Ever since the album \"Offerings,\" this band has been one of the best in worship music, and this release will only underscore that strength in style.\n", "val": 0.022186994552612305}

Now they are producing & putting out music on such a regular basis that it is all starting to sound the same to me. It's as if they plugged in certain numbers of an equation and figured, \"This is what people are listening to, they'll buy our music\" rather than staying true to their roots & where they started off. I like it, but it just all sounds the same as what they've already done. I'm a music junkie and tend to criticize albums more than most, so take my review with a grain of salt.

As it always takes me more than a few listenings to fully appreciate their CDs, after about the 15th time listening to \"Move\" I have to say they met my high expectations once again.

{"text": "Third Day is undisputedly one of the longest running christian bands in the industry, and has never failed to put forth a quality release, although as years went by their sound has undergone slight, but noticable changes. The self-titled debut, and Time both showed off the bands southern sound, while Come Together and Wherever You Are brought forth a more commercial sound. 2008's Revelation definitely pushed the envelope for a beefier southern sound.When Move was released I had no high expectations. Revelation was my favorite album, and I thought it would be difficult to top, additionally Move would be the first album Brad Avery does not actually play guitar on. And then my wife bought me the CD, and my fears were found worthless. The album picks up with three tracks that define the rest of the albums sound. The opening track, Lift Up Your Face, is a great heavy minor-keyed track similar to revelations Forevermore. Lift Up Your Face is also filled in and enhanced by the background vocals of The Blind Boys of Alabama giving it a more traditional southern sound. The next song, Make Your Move, can be described as nothing else other than pure southern rock. The song has a great groove, and the voice of Mac Powell doesn't hurt any. Thirdly, Children of God just shows the bands more praise and worship side, heavy with passion and with music.Though the first three songs define what you can expect the album, every song stands on its own. Where Third Day pushed the southern rock sound in the past, they completely broke through with Move and delivered everything I had hoped to hear from the band, and everything else I've already come to expect. Move is an exceptional album, and hopefully the start of a new niche for one of christian musics classic bands.\n", "val": 0.015548580326139927}

{"text": "So others have said why this album is great instead of recreating another one of those reviews I thought I'd tell you why I really like this album.So I'm not a huge Third Day fan. I have a few of their albums and I've bought several singles over the years, but I really started getting back into contemporary Christian around the time Casting Crowns were starting up and I guess I thought of Third Day as a band wit their best albums behind them.... I remember picking up their album Wire and really liking the raw production sound. It wasn't that polished Nashville Christian album sound at all, at had bite to it (I don't find much polished in the Bible, so I tend to gravitate towards this sort of sound when it comes to Christian music). Wire was an pretty good album, but after it they went back to a more polished studio sound for Wherever You Are and Revelation. I think those polished albums and some of the great songs on them Mac Powell has proven he and his band can do refined or they can do edgy southern rock. The CCM industry isn't any more forgiving than mainstream if anything they are probably more judgmental when it comes tot his sort of thing, but with nothing left to proven instead of doing what I expected an aging band to do and continue to put out good-at-best albums, these guys go and produce what I think is the best album they've ever made! From there the other reviews probably say it best. Every song is excellent, great songwriting, passion filled powerful vocals, great production. In a way this album feels like the band saying \"we're doing things our way again\". Of course you know they always have done things as they wanted.... but this one just suits them just right... Move is pretty much everything I liked about Wire, except with better songwriting and songs that seem to hit their mark a lot better... Third Day is getting better, not growing old and tired!\n", "val": 0.016449205577373505}

Many people have felt that Christian music has taken a drastic turn in their style, but the words are there, and the meaning is still there.

{"text": "So, I wrote my LOST: The Final Season review a few weeks back thinking it was going to be the last LOST release musically. However, I noticed that almost no music was included from the last episode to my disappointment. Several people pointed out on forums and emailed me directly to notice that the only 2 tracks from the final episodes were labeled as \"Bonus Tracks\". So, naturally it was believed a separate release was being planned all along. Ta-da! Almost immediately following that release we have 2 discs dedicated to the last 4 episodes of the series with disc 2 being completely reserved for the final episode.Now, LOST has been and will always be the pinnacle of TV scores. There has never been another score in television history that has done what Giacchino has done with LOST. If you want to hear me praise LOST as a series then read my review of LOST: The Final Season. What this release allows listeners to discover is how goddamn well Michael's music closes this series out. I'm going to focus mainly on the second disc here. Listening to that disc all the way through gave me the exact same emotional shaking I got when I watched the final episode on TV.Throughout this series Giacchino has composed themes that have become iconic staples of the show, and now you get to witness how he takes all those themes and brings them to a beautiful close. Every theme is represented here if even for only a moment. These themes that represent our beloved characters and their emotions immediately become our own emotions. The music in LOST is Giacchino's own personal reaction to the show. He composes each episode and each moment from how he is feeling and that creates such a connection with the audience that it becomes almost too overwhelming. LOST is the only series that has such faith in its composer that it let the entire series end with music. The final 4 minutes of the last episode has maybe only 2-3 seconds of diagetic sound. That is amazing.Anyone who is reading this has seen the ending. When Jack limps onto the beach, falls to the ground, and watches the plane take off it is one of the most tragic things in the entire series. Yet how does Giacchino make you cry? By making the music the most beautiful music you've ever heard. I truly don't believe there is such a thing as sad music. You can feel sad and watch something sad, but think of every sad scene from a movie or show. Take notice of the music. Is it sad? No, it's beautiful. Giacchino is highlighting the beauty of life. The beauty of being alive and being human. And since Jack is about to die and lose that beauty it becomes the saddest thing. Whether you interpret the ending to be heaven or just the final thoughts running through Jack's mind before he passes it's nonetheless beautiful. I cannot listen to the track \"Moving On\" without crying. It's impossible. If that track doesn't make you cry then I truly believe you are dead inside and for that I pity you.Michael Giacchino has carried this series for 6 whole seasons, which is a remarkable achievement for one composer to do at the level he was doing it. He has crafted some of the finest music ever written. Music that lifts above the show and carries its emotions with it always. You can listen to any piece of music from the show and have the emotions rush through you like it was the first time you were listening to it. This release is wonderful and it gives us that closure that Giacchino gave us in the final episode. Years from now people will look back at Giacchino's work here and still say \"wow\". Thank you, Michael. Thanks for the music and thanks for reminding us about the beauty in life.\n", "val": 0.0019663176499307156}

{"text": "I first saw this band open for another artist and I was so wowed by them immediately. They were better than the artist they preceded, and I have rarely experienced that. My wife and I bought their first CD that night and loved it. I fully expected the second album to be a let down, particularly if it tried to replicate the same magic only to fall into repitition. I'm very happy to say that Elizabeth and the Catapault have pleasantly surprised me again. This is a very logical next step, but bold nonetheless. Ziman's voice is a bit chameleon-like in certain songs, and always unique. To get a bit stereotypical, I don't usually enjoy 'girl' bands, mostly because I just don't identify with what they're singing about, but lyrically Ziman is pretty universal and mature beyond her years. I can't say this is an about-face turn from Taller Children, but it's pretty different and appropriately so. How is this band not hitting it big yet?\n", "val": 0.02709410898387432}

Instead, their sound has matured into lush, full songs that are just as fun and enjoyable, but more melodic. They truly struck it outside the ballpark with this one.

{"text": "Of course, this should really be titled \"The Previously Undiscovered Masters\" since they've obviously been discovered at this point, but that quibble aside, this is an impressive set of ten tracks that were, for one reason or another, left in the can. Waxed in the 70s, 80s and 90s at Charles' RPM International Studios, some of the tracks emerged from the vault completely finished, and some were fleshed out with matching contemporary arrangements. There's soul, blues and jazz, as one would expect from a Ray Charles album, but there are a few examples of his affinity for country, as well. A cover of Hank Cochran's \"A Little Bitty Tear\" is sung as gospel blues, and the album's biggest surprise is a finished duet with Johnny Cash covering Kris Kristofferson's \"Why Me, Lord?\" The latter, produced by the legendary Billy Sherrill in 1981, has Cash singing lead in his resonant baritone while Charles provides soulful electric piano and backing vocals. Charles sounds terrific on all ten tracks, elevating the players (both then and now) with his soulfulness. Producer John Burk (who helmed Charles' last album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Genius-Loves-Company/dp/B0002F7I9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Genius Loves Company</a>) has done a magical job of melding the vintage productions with the new work, creating an album that's a  great deal more cohesive than you'd expect from a set that began its life as disparate vault recordings.

{"text": "This album includes 10 previously unreleased songs from the Ray Charles vault, polished up for release by producer John Burk, who also produced Ray Charles' last album, \"Genius Loves Company\". It could easily have deteriorated into a farce -- a collection of half-finished songs and scratchy demos slapped onto a disc to keep the money machine alive.Happily, this is not the case. These tunes are produced with care, and their feel is true to Ray Charles' legacy, even though many have been fleshed out with the help of musicians in the studio today. Charles recorded the songs over three decades, from the 1970s to the 1990s. Despite that, the album has a satisfying cohesiveness, thanks no doubt to the producer and engineers. It felt like listening to a real Ray Charles album that stands up to much of his best work.The instrumentation is polished, and includes plenty of both strings and horns. The style frequently dances a line between R&B and an adult compemporary feel -- the way that Ray Charles really pulled off consistently well.Stand-outs for me included \"Wheel of Fortune\", which recalled for me some of the atmospheres of Charles' country and western period. I also loved \"There'll Be Some Changes Made\", a song I've enjoyed since it was featured in the 1979 Bob Fosse film \"All That Jazz\". Of course, this slower, soulful version is very different.\"I'm Gonna Keep on Singin',\" from the mid-1900s, starts out with a funkadelic bass line leading into ethereal electric piano and dreamy guitar accompaniment. Backup female singers recall the Raelettes, as Charles riffs vocally in prose over the beat. Classic.The final song, \"Why Me Lord?\" by Kris Kristofferson, is fantastic, but kind of an odd man out -- a duet with Johnny Cash in which Cash sings the lead vocal. Hearing these two singing together \"Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hands\" is moving, given that this recording is being released posthumously for both of them.This album is a posthumous collection of re-engineered, overdubbed recordings. Sounds awful, doesn't it? But I'm glad I put aside my misgivings and gave it a shot. Very satisfying. Especially at the $3.99 MP3 Daily Deal price on October 26, 2010, it is a great bargain as well. The biggest problem is the relatively short 41-minute total run time. Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.02217026986181736}

{"text": "Kem's \"Intimacy: Album III\" is filled with satisfying, soul-drenched warm-bath ballads that will please his fan base. The result is a winning fusion of of old-school R&B and contemporary jazz.He uses his expressive, intimate voice with great intelligence. He is capable of eliciting drama where his contemporaries tend to overdo or undersell. His limitations as a producer and song writer are therefore minimized.The ethereal, distant quality of his earlier material has given way to something more straightforward and sensual, making the album incidentally more palatable.\"When I'm Loving You\" is a fine example with its lush, tropical atmosphere, complete with acoustic guitar tropical and ear-pleasing drum patter. Comparisons to Sade are inevitable. \"Can You Feel It\" and \"Human Touch\" continue the pattern, with Kem's voice riding the waves of his busy, seductive melodies.These songs are built less upon radio-ready hooks and more on grooves, texture and the sincerity of Kem's delivery. That said, the cliched yet well-crafted lead single \"Why Would You Stay?\" has done well on the airwaves, hitting the top 20 of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart. Its overtly romantic quality and distinctly 90s-sounding production reminds of Boyz II Men. \"You're On My Mind\" follows suit.Jill Scott adds a shot of caffeine to the gospel-infused \"Golden Days\" with her inspired preaching, and Maurissa Rose complements Kem beautifully on the inspired \"If It's Love,\" another R&B slow-burn and potential hit. The best track is \"A Mother's Love\" with its piano-driven, double-edged melody. It's as beautiful as its title.Sessions for the album took place over a three-year span - this music was clearly and carefully labored over. There are other artists with similar voices and songwriting ability, but \"Intimacy: Album III\" shows Kem to be a dedicated, passionate musician deserving of his place on the shelf.\n", "val": 0.024370046332478523}

I was expecting more low-key angst and short, but brilliant lyrics. I was so surprised, in fact, that it took me a moment to realize that my foot was involuntarily tapping to the beat of this little gem. After a few more listens at Ryan's website (and the shock of this unexpected lyrical and musical turn wore off) I realized that we were getting just another peek into the artist that is Lee DeWyze.Lee moves so easily between many different styles from the soulful Annabelle (Slumberland), to the sexy, bluesy Ain't No Sunshine (see youtube VillageUnderground), to his poignant cover of The Boxer, right up to this cheery, uplifting, pop song. No, Lee DeWyze is no one-trick pony and I can't wait until I can hear the rest of Live It Up.

The lyrics, however, do not use words that are offensive, so Tipper Gore would be happy about this.  Consequently, these songs are not all good for the younger under 18 crowd to hear, but may already know about!  This group is a mix of funk, party music, rock and roll with a taste of the full horn section like in that of Chicago.  There are three main singers.  This group always dresses as mummies, but is not a Halloween band.  They wear these costumes on a regular basis so that they cannot be identified for various legal precautionary reasons; they were originally all session/studio musicians located in Tennessee who have struck out on their own.  The sound of this CD is somewhat reminicent of a carnival atmosphere in the title song and the reprise.  To date, I feel it is their best work, but their first CD will always be my favorite.  If you have followed them from their beginning, you can hear the progression that they have reached in Carnal Carnival.  They have become more experienced in writing and you can hear how far they have come in their musical arranging.  As a bunch of talented studio/session musicians, you can appreciate how far they have come to reach this point in their career.  And, their harmonizing is also a hit everytime.  These boys got it right!  Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.009985581040382385}
{"text": "I've been a fan of Here Come The Mummies for about 3 or 4 years, I own their previous three albums, and have seen them many times in concert and I gotta say this latest album is awesome, like Libido Knieval awesome.The first album was great, then Everlasting Party raised the bar with an addictive album that became even more addicting once you saw these guys in concert. Single Entendre came out next and although it has some great hits like \"Luscious\" and \"Libido Kneivel\" I didn't find myself listening to most of the songs over and over and over again like I had with the last two cd's. Compared to Everlasting Party (the album that made me a Mummies fan) I felt a bit let down and worried that perhaps the best had passed them by. Not that Single Entendre was horrible, but it's hard to match the amazing stuff in \"Everlasting Party\".Luckily, \"Carnal Carnival\" is what I've been waiting for! This album is full of good songs that only grow on you the more you listen to them.I'm very happy that HCTM comes right out of the box with an amazing first song to kick us in the face with awesomeness. In my opinion the first song usually makes or breaks the album, and this one hits a home run everytime. The song \"Carnal Carnival\" has that HCTM energy that you expect from the grooviest undead on the planet. You listen to this song and want to jump up and down and sing real loud as if you were at one of their concerts. You will be listening to this song over and over. THIS is how you start an album!!! This song is just as good as \"Believe\" and \"Tip Toe\", and miles ahead of \"Ugly\". When the first song is this good you know you are in for something special. This will be the next BIG thing at their concerts, I guarantee it.Next up is \"Freak Flag\", which continues the momentum from the first song. This song just gets better and better as you keep listening to it (a common thing for songs on this album). I also think this song is going to be popular at their concerts, all of us Mummies fans love letting our \"Freak Flag Fly\" at their shows,Song 3 is  \"Chunky\" which is just comical! They slow down the tempo a bit on this one but it's fun to learn the lyrics and listen to.Song 4 is \"Hurricanes, Floods & Fires\" which is one of their more generic love songs. It's not a bad song, but it isn't much new if you've heard some of their stuff before and its not one you will be listening to as much as some of the other gems on this album. The song's lyrics just seem a bit too forced to work for me.Song 5 is \"Eye of Horus\" and its another great one. It starts off with an odd chorus, which I think the Chorus will be fun at their shows when everyone is singing and dancing like crazy. The more you listen to this song the more it will grow on you. At first I didn't care much for it and now I'm listening to it a lot.Song 6 is \"Love Triangle\" and it's probably the best or second best song on the entire cd. I'm not a big fan of their love songs BUT this one has an amazing tune, the lyrics compliment the sound from the instruments, it's really that good. The guitar, bass, trumpets, saxophone, drums, piano, all of it just comes together and sounds so insanely polished that you can't believe HCTM isn't more well known for their music. This is the Mummies at their best.Right after Love Triangle is the song \"Splurge\" which is nearly guaranteed to make you lol (that's laugh out loud for you older Mummies out there) like I did the first time I heard it. It's not going to be a song that you remember for an amazing beat or solo but it's just HCTM being silly and having fun. Be sure you listen to this song all the way to the end for the real kicker, there's one phrase that will keep you listening to the song again and again because it's just pure awesome. Only Java the mummy could pull this off btw.Song 8 is \"Stroke of Midnight\" which isn't as powerful as the first song or \"Love Triangle\" but it's still fun to listen to and sing. Although it sounds slightly like generic HCTM I could see this song as being real big at their concerts with how fun it is to sing. Also, be sure to stick around to the end of the song for a sweet sax solo.Song 9 is \"Creepin\" one of the better songs on the album. It starts off with this oriental tune and the lyrics are fun to learn/sing. This will probably be another big hit at their shows. The only weird thing with this song is that the singer sounds a lot like weird al at times. This song also shows that HCTM is willing to experiment with the sound of their songs compared to what we've seen in the past. This is kind of uncharted territory for them in a way and its nice to see them taking risks like this.After \"Creepin\" is the song \"Ho Heave\" which will remind you a lot of \"Eternity\" from the first album \"Terrifying Funk from the Grave\". It's a slow funky tune with some goofy fun lyrics. Not one of the better songs on the album you'll be repeating in your head all day but I gotta admit it grows on you the more you hear it. This is also the longest song on the album and might be a tad too long (tons of ho heaving) but my guess is the crowd might get into this song during a concert.Song 11 is \"U Can't B Beat\" which another slow love song but filled with some pretty funny sexual innuendos we come to expect with HCTM. This is the 2nd longest song on the album at just over 5 minutes long.Song 12 is \"Jailbait\" and it speeds up the tempo a bit after the slow song. It's a song about a girl that's \"Jailbait\", in other words a young girl that is insanely sexy but of course you're too old to have her haha. There's a pretty sweet piano/keyboard solo in this one and the song picks up a bit at the end.Song 13 is \"The Now\". It's technically the last full song of the album and it's not too bad, but it seems more like one of the generic HCTM songs, it doesn't end the album on a strong note like \"Everlasting Party\" does or \"Lucious\" but that's ok with how strong the album starts. There is also some awesome solos in this one with the Sax then the Drums which I'm sure will be expanded upon in concert. The only thing I don't get is the 20 seconds at the end of the song that is pretty much no noise at all.Song 14 is \"Carnal Carnival Reprise\" and is just a nice little way to close out the album, it's only about 57 second long.Now that we've summed up all the songs, here's some stuff to wrap things up.Best songs of this album:Carnal CarnivalLove TriangleSplurgeFreak FlagCreepinEye of HorusNot so great songs of the album:Hurricanes, Floods, and FiresThe NowHo HeaveAlthough I listed good songs and bad songs (of course you might like the ones I don't so please give them all a chance), that was only to help those not wanting the full album pick a couple of songs because nobody should be without at least some Here Come The Mummies! Overall the album is VERY good, just as good as \"Everlasting Party\" (maybe better?!) and definitely better than \"Single Entendre\" and the aging \"Terrifying Funk from Beyond the Grave\".Final Word:Downloading this for $9 is a no-brainer for people who like good music and also for anyone that appreciates bands/artists that write their own music and actually play instruments. This is the kind of music AND TALENT that I think more people need to appreciate and support. This is band is amazing and they deserve a lot more attention than a lot of these \"fake\" \"stars\" that don't even write their own music and spend their time at concerts lip synching to their fans that paid ten times more to see them than we do to see the Mummies.This would be a great album to get if you are new to HCTM but it's also a great addition for anyone like me who has their three previous albums and has been following the Mummies for years. It should also be noted that there is a lot of experimentation in here in terms of some of the sounds we hear (some songs are definitely unique sounding for HCTM, Creepin's oriental tune is a good example) and it's good to see them willing to take this risk and push their music forward and give their fans something new to enjoy. Lastly, the audio quality is superb, HCTM just keeps making their cd's sound better and better.This album is Here Come The Mummies at their best, I can't recommend it enough.\n", "val": 0.021091774106025696}

It also runs against the grain of the whole flashy aesthetic that existed in the 80s.\" If you're even contemplating purchasing this brilliant song I would most definitely recommend you do, you will not be disappointed. You may even enjoy it enough to purchase more, for the video to this great song check out Macklemore.com.

I'm guessing they're planning to release all these songs, remixed and original over time, and i can understand the guys wanting people to focus on ryan lewis' production, but i gotta say, when i opened the mail to find my gator copy of the heist, sharkface gang tank and 9 extra songs than the version of VS.REDUX they have on amazon, it was a much more rewarding experience than \"1 clicking\" 6 of 15 tracks.And it's cheaper too.All things aside, this AMAZON version has a few REALLY great songs and a few not so great. not a bad deal if you pick it up with \"the unplanned mix tape,\" otherwise i'd highly recommend checking out the macklemore online store.Cool deals and LOTS more music than you'll find here.\n", "val": 0.0019148485735058784}

{"text": "First, I'd like to say that my taste in music is not so limited that I cannot accept a new idea or a new sound. The thing I really dislike about this song is the fact that the lyrics are just so ignorant. Especially the part where he raps: \"Before I have to knock that loud mouth out. I'm tired of talkin, man, ya'll ain't listenin.'\" I'm sorry, but that just sounds so adolescent, the kind of whiny attitude I'm glad to have left behind in middle school... Not to mention, the song never evolves. It's always just a few lines of rapping with stupid adolescent lyrics, then the same chorus every time until the end. I guess it wouldn't have been as bad if there was some kind of progression or if the song led somewhere, but to me, there was simply no redeeming quality in this song. I didn't like the sound and I don't like the lyrics. Usually even if one is bad, if the other is very good it can win me over. The best songs are those who have both, but this one has neither. So one star is all it'll get from me. Now for me to listen to my favorite Jason Aldean songs...\n", "val": 2.4142345864675008e-05}

{"text": "This album is simply a must-have, a fantastically produced psychedelic artifact that, to my ears at least, never falls into that slushy kind of kitsch bandwagon-psych that filled the airwaves then too, and which reviewer Mr Hoffman must be referring to. Psych fans can rest assured that this is an album without embarrassing moments, but rather with some of the most creative use of overdubs and effects you'll ever hear. If you like psychedelic music or quality sixties pop then this album is an obligatory purchase that will not be regretted, the minimalistic cover does not at all reflect the colour and beauty of this album, every song on which is a mini-masterpiece made to be listened to with headphones.From the wistful beauty of the melodies in 'It's You', which criminally failed to chart yet seemed destined to reach the top of the charts, to the uniqueness of psychedelic tracks like 'The Know It All', which combines unexpected musical elements to create a song like you've never heard before, to the spiritual yearning of 'The Island', to the opus 'Karmic Dream Sequence, No. 1', perhaps one of the greatest psychedelic compositions of the sixties, this is an album rare in it's variety and brilliance. It's a clear an enormous amount of effort was put into this, and it brought out the best of the incredible pool of talent involved.If you like this, I'd recommend Eternity's Children's first album, which has equally remarkable production from Boettcher, although with a slightly more naive poppy atmosphere.\n", "val": 0.042923454195261}
{"text": "Wow, how bloated can one get when reviewing a simply great album.I couldn't stay silent after reading WT Hoffman's review of this superb album.

But one has to realize what an amazing achievement was this album for then or any time.I was blessed to actually attend one of the sessions for this album, having worked for Gary Usher for many years.  Everyonein the room knew they were creating something that would stand the test of time. So it didn't sell well? Is that the albumor the public's fault?  Ever heard of Jane Siberry? She doesn't sell well, but she makes amazing music.I count myself very fortunate to have this gem on CD.Compared to most of the well-produced garbage today that \"sells well\", I would take this album any day.Just saying.\n", "val": 0.011183436959981918}
{"text": "THE MILLENNIUM by Begin was a studio project headed by Boettcher, who helped the ASSOCIATION orchestrate \"ALONG COMES MARY\" back in 1966. He helped produce other mid 60s \"heavy\" pop songs like CHERISH, and was a big name in LA.  As the \"Summer of Love\" was fast approaching, the LA scene was changing, with bands like LOVE, THE DOORS, ZAPPA's MOTHERS, BYRDS, and other acts of that ilk, were replacing the \"Unhip\" sounds like Beach Music, Mamas and Papas, or fake studio bands like early Monkees, etc. Anyway, since Boettcher was such an important producer, COLUMBIA records allowed Boettcher to assemble a \"studio band\", and use the FIRST 16 TRACK machine, (two 8 track recorders slaved together) to make a masterpiece of peices. PIECES, because you have 7 members of this studio group, formed from old bands breaking up, and some of their songs, along with various other musicians in the LA studio scene. Because you have too many cooks throwing stuff in the pot, there is no COHESION in style here. \"BEGIN\" doesnt sound like a single album at all. Some of the songs (the doowop lovey dovey ones) date back to 1965 or so. Then, you have the GOOD songs, most of which Boettcher wrote. Apparently, he was the guy who DOSED, and it shows. If anyone tells you this is some kind of psychedelic masterpiece, ignore them. The album has some INCREDIBLE production values, and with the songs that ARE trippy, there's a cool \"everything and the kitchen sink\" philosophy to the overdubs, that sounds pretty cool. (but dated, of course.)The album starts out promising, with the \"PRELUDE\" song flowing seamlessly into \"TO CLAUDIA ON THURSDAY.\"  Then, you get these Doo-wop/ ASSOCIATION love songs.  The vocal parts are dense, but with very predictable harmonies, and overstacked melody vocals. It just goes to show, how new and revolutionary the vocal harmonies were for bands like THE BYRDS, Buffalo Springfield, or even \"SMILE\" period Beach Boys, compaired with what came before . In order to make some of the Doo-wop love songs sound more hip, the producer layered on the most obvious \"psychedelic\" effects, on songs where it sounds mismatched. You have these wierd \"sound effects\" of the ocean, birds, etc, on songs which simply have nothing to do with psychedelia. The lyrics are about boys and girls in love, the chord changes predictable. When the songs DO work, and ARE psychedelic, the album works. That's the most maddening part of assessing this album. If you want to view BEGIN as acid music, you need to sequence an album out of the FIRST TWO SONGS, and the LAST FOUR. \"THE KNOW IT ALL\" is especially freaky, with lots of odd chords, bizarre lyrics, and mindbending production twists. \"KARMIC DREAM  SEQUENCE #1\" is the freak out the title promises. (Its easy to spot the acid songs...Boettcher wrote them, for the most part.) This KARMIC song is the only song that passes the 5 minute mark on the album...or the 4 minute mark.  Its sort of a dreamy, utopian type of psychedelia, with a ton of bizarre effects, and instruments, including a KOTO (japanese lute), lots of oriental percussion, and VSO (changing the speed of the tape, to create that \"Take off\" sound). On \"KARMIC\", Boettcher removed those dated DOO WOP vocal stacks, replacing them with wierd screams, and even tacked on the harpsicord part that opens up the album's first song.  The album ends with a grab bag \"band effort\", where they sing about LISTENING TO THE TRUTH OF OUR SONGS. (The fact that this band would think their mishmash of lyrics and styles represents a single \"MESSAGE\" that can change the world, is unintentionally such a goof.) Then, you get a dose of super trippy sound effects disolving into DOO WOP singing, and a bit of backmasking, and its ALL OVER. And that is the Psychedelic masterpiece.  The album is a bit difficult to digest as a whole.  There was no more MILLENIUM albums, cos it never sold. (Plus the band ran up the biggest recording debt in Columbia's history.)  After this album came a single, \"JUST ABOUT THE SAME\" b/w \"BLIGHT\", that is normally included with the CD editions of this album.  It's a great single, and matches the psychedelic sound of the better songs from BEGIN.Overall, I'd recommend this album to \"60s psychedelia completists\", also to producers who would like to hear how early 16 track recording was approached, or fans of the ASSOCIATION's vocal harmonies.  I should give this album only 3 stars, since there is no band cohesion happening, nor stylistic center. But the production values are incredible on both the trippy songs, and the doo wop love songs. If you have the bread, man, you get about 18-20 minutes of pretty groovy psychedelia, but its dated, baby. All in all, some great songs to put in that perfect psychedelic mix tape you might be planning.\n", "val": 0.00015719383372925222}

It is like I play the piano, I can hit the correct notes, but it is mechanical and soulless, so I no longer do it.  There have been a bunch of singer/songwriter  that I have respected and some I liked since I was young.  Buddy Holly, Arlo Guthrie, Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens, Donovan, Joan Baez, John Denver, Joni Mitchell, Jim Croce, Neil Diamond, Carly Simon  to name a few off the top of my head.  As you may have guessed I am not young, I am 70 so am well outside of what is considered Miss Swifts demographic.She puts into words and music what I (and I belive everyone else) have felt at some time in life, and I belive the job of a singer/songwriter is to give voice to those of us who have no talent.  I would place Taylor Swift in the list of Great Singer/Songwriters,  whos work I enjoy.  Jerry Lee Lewis was also a great singer/songwriter he put his hart soul and body into his music, but it did not connect with me, Post hoc ergo procter hoc I do not purchase his music I do and will continue to purchase Miss Swifts work.Earl Harbeson\n", "val": 8.182686724467203e-05}

{"text": "This album sucks. The first two songs are good but after that the rest is just all right. Some of the songs are hysterical and I'm just not into it. As a Catholic I was offended by the lyric \"I've abandoned cold religion\". A million Catholics were martyred in the 20th century so they definitely aren't cold. And we don't need to be crazy \"cool Christians\" in rock bands to be devoted to God. The spirit of the Catholic liturgy is a contrite recollection and sometimes a kind of sadness because we are calling to mind the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross for our sins and making that present again in the sacrifice of the mass. I liked \"Arriving\" and \"See the morning\" and I even know how to play some of Chris' songs on the guitar. I saw him live and liked it but this album is not good. I probably won't even listen to it a second time.\n", "val": 5.1076553063467145e-05}

The mid and end of the records are the strongest, and hopefully the label will push these tracks to radio.

{"text": "Although Chris Tomlin's music is stuff I enjoy listening to, I purchase it primarily to locate new songs to introduce to my church. We have a contemporary service with a full band (drums, keys, bass, etc.).As a worship leader, I'm always looking for music that is solid theologically, has a great sound, is musically reproducable by my musicians, and is also \"singable\", meaning that the melody and words are things the congregation can learn and sing along to.  When I listened to \"Hello Love\", I remember thinking that there weren't just one or two songs on the album I wanted to introduce at my church, I wanted to do ALL of them.I came close to having the same feeling about this album.  The only difference was that Tomlin's \"sound\" has added programmed drums / beats.  Our church does not have someone who can create this on a computer, so music like David Crowder that I love, just can't be done at our church because it relys so much on computer programmed music that a live band cannot reproduce.  Tomlin has added some of this to this album, which makes for a great sounding album, but eliminates some of the songs from our church's ability to perform them.  It's not a criticism of the album's overall sound, which actually is more contemporary with those additions, it just changes our ability to recreate the songs for our church.  Still highly recommend the album for church or private worship.\n", "val": 0.004762979689985514}

{"text": "I have had a chance to have this album a couple of months now and have listened to it many times through and like pretty much any CD, it only gets better with time, and that is only more true with worship music because it becomes an immersion, worship experience in your car, office, etc.  Of course, \"Our God\" is the first single of this album and is a wonderful, powerful, and catchy, song that gives us strength knowing that if we are seeking God, there is nothing that can stand in our way. \"I Will Follow,\" is another great song, and the 2nd single - a truly simple message that we often miss -- Where you go, I'll go and where you STAY I'll STAY --- I find this second half of that line particularly powerful especially as someone who has been in church their entire life and finds themselves acting on behalf of God without always consulting God, this song has become a reality check.  The other song I really like on this album is \"Lovely\".  I really hope this is the next single from the album because it deserves a greater exposure.  Another simply put fresh perspective, the way we look at natural wonders, the same awesome God created that, took the time to make us so intricately.As far as the \"sound\" of the CD, i would say that the \"sound\" still has the classical Chris Tomlin elements, the almost U2ish sound that most of 'burb contemporary christian music has adopted, with a few songs having more pop beats that break a little away from the mold.  As a worship leader this is something that I look forward to try to duplicate musically.Overall this is a wonderful album and stands up well with Hello Love, See the Morning and all the rest. I looked forward to using many of these songs at our church over the course of 2011.

{"text": "The Passion movement has its stars.  Chris Tomlin is its superstar.  He has seen the most commercial success, and he is very much the front-runner of mainstream American modern worship.  In some respects, it's very hard for Tomlin to top himself.  The enduring success of many songs from Arriving (2004) manifests itself continually on the CCLI top ten list.  \"How Great is Our God,\" \"Holy is the Lord,\" and (Laura Story's) \"Indescribable\" are now mainstay go-to anthems for mainstream contemporary/modern worship.  See the Morning (2006) and Hello Love (2008) were great albums but did not yield for the church the same caliber of lasting tunes for the church.  And if Our God is For Us is probably also destined to a similar fate, though the album, as a whole, seems to notch back toward greater congregational accessibility as compared to the previous two (See the Morning and Hello Love had its share of more performance-oriented, radio-friendly material).  The album's title gets its name from the moving and raucous bridge of the first track, \"Our God,\" which made its first recorded appearance earlier this year on Passion's Awakening.REVIEW SUMMARYAnd if Our God is For Us should not be considered a worship album in the proper sense, but many of its songs are congregationally-friendly and appropriate for corporate singing.  The musical production is exquisite, making typical pop songs and arrangements fresh to the ears through interesting and creative choices of color.  Theologically, the album is God-centered.  As is the case with the other mainstream worship leaders who have come of age (e.g. Redman, Hughes), there is a maturity and biblical overlay to the textual content that was not as present in Tomlin's earlier songwriting ventures.  \"All to Us\" is a fresh, moving, and powerful song with hints at a new theological focus for Tomlin (ecclesiology).  I do hold a mild concern that the Gospel of Christ's atonement is extremely understated in this album (one could note the same thing about many previous albums).  Tomlin is a master of writing broad, sweeping songs of exultation to God, but I wish for more explicitness as to the fuel of what makes that possible for us--the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.The songs I would incorporate for corporate worship at my church would be, in order: \"All to Us,\" \"Our God,\" and \"Awakening.\"See the full review at [...]:[...]\n", "val": 0.012985453940927982}

Some of my favorites are \"All to Us\", \"Majesty of Heaven\" and of course \"I Will Follow\".  Just a solid collection of praise music that will energize the soul!  Christy Nockels also appears on this CD and her voice is the voice of an angel!  Her soaring harmonies with Chris are amazing and it just sends chills up & down your spine.  Chris is an amazing talent and his message is so simple and biblically based.  Many of Chris' songs reference verses in the bible and having seen Chris in concert my favorite times are when he relates how he came to write a particular song and what motivated him to do so.  I love watching him on \"New Song Cafe\" talk about his music and also seeing him perform many of his songs with just an acoustic guitar.  I lead worship in my church and sing many of Chris' songs because they are so inspirational & powerful!

This is a simple worship song that doesn't need any bells and whistles.  When I'm in church and the worship band plays this song everyone, and I mean EVERYONE sings along.  So the song is great, but this version stinks.  The biggest issue is that the radio version of this song is only available on the WOW series of Christian compilations, unless you get it elsewhere.  I bought this version expecting the radio version and was seriously disappointed.  I don't even listen to it.  I got the radio version and listen to that one.  The only reason I am rating this song a 3 and not lower is because the lyrics are good, the song itself is lacking.If you have the chance to find the radio version, go for it, otherwise pass on this version unless you're a remix fan.\n", "val": 3.5124325222568586e-05}

Very soft, very mellow, very intimate but silly and charming and sweet at the same time. It's like watching an awkward seduction that has grand hopes of success.

{"text": "Tim McGraw is one of the few regular Nashville hitmakers who manages to sing songs with substance.  As trite as \"Live Like You Were Dying\" may be, it spoke to people; it's a song with true lasting power.  Not all of the tunes collected here are (\"Indian Outlaw\" is best forgotten), but surprisingly, they are all well-crafted, solid tunes performed by a man who knows how to deliver a song.The new single, \"It Felt Good On My Lips,\" isn't worth the price of admission alone; it's a strong enough tune (another Warren Brothers number), but far from the best here.  McGraw is at his best when he's digging deep down for emotion (\"Grown Men Don't Cry,\" \"Please Remember Me\") or cutting loose (\"Real Good Man,\" \"Something Like That\").  Intermediary tunes like \"Watch the Wind Blow By\" lag behind; but fortunately, these numbers are few and far between.NUMBER ONE HITS may be an unnecessary collection for McGraw fans (who probably have all the albums already), but if you're just turning onto his music, it's a solid place to start.  Never a truly great artist, McGraw does sometimes break out of Nashville's boundaries (\"Last Dollar\" is a perfect example), creating radio-friendly music with an artistic bent.  This album showcases him as his best--which, even his critics have to admit, is pretty darn good.\n", "val": 0.014474458061158657}

Add Tim McGraw's twangy country voice and delivery and you get an emotional and worthwhile listening experience. Highly Recommended!\n", "val": 0.044231921434402466}
