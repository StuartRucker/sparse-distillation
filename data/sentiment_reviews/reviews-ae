And \"Felt Good On My Lips\" is an amazing song.That's what makes it so difficult to give this CD only one star.But the fault of that lies with Curb, not with McGraw.  Curb, desperate to milk Tim for everything has now released the following Greatest Hits Packages from Tim McGraw:Greatest Hits (completely legitimate)Reflected: Greatest Hits 2 (completely legitimate)Greatest Hits Volume 3 (It had material 1&2 didn't have, so it was worth the price, plus it had \"Find Out Who Your Friends Are\" and \"Nine Lives\" - still shady on Curb's part since Tim had only released one album since, but, eh)Then, Curb got greedy\"Greatest Hits 1 and 2\" double packGreatest Hits 1-3And NOW #1 Hits. AGAIN after only one new record.No wonder McGraw is in such a hurry to ditch Curb and find a new label. They keep rereleasing everything simply to make a few extra bucks.Download \"Felt Good On My Lips\" for 99 cents and send a message to Curb that this rereleasing isn't going to make them any money.Can't wait for some new music from Tim McGraw.\n", "val": 4.5402917749015614e-05}

{"text": "Tim McGraw has been a staple of country music for around 20 years, and the only reason he's slowing down is to make movies and even more money doing it.  This collection of his #1 hits will take you down the back roads in a beat-up pickup truck, telling you several heartfelt stories along the way.  But make no mistake: Tim's always been known to stomp his feet and kick a little every now and then as well, which is well-represented here.  If you want a primer of Tim McGraw essentials, this is the right place to look (and while it lasts, the right PRICE, HOLY COW, FOUR BUCKS for a DOUBLE ALBUM of greatest hits).  My only complaint: the inexcusable omission of Tim's greatest song ever...that legendary ballad of the ages, \"Do You Want Fries With That\".\n", "val": 0.0031027544755488634}

{"text": "As a fan of Nota since watching them take the title in season one of NBC's \"The Sing Off,\" I have been waiting in anticipation for their album release.I feared that a great a capella group would go into the studio and be so overly engineered that their signature sound would be lost. Boy, was I WRONG!This album ROCKS! With 11 songs, they managed to capture a bit of everything for everyone, but cohesively. You don't feel like you're listening to some random mishmash. It all fits together and captures what I grew to love about NOTA from watching \"The Sing Off.\" You get some great covers of popular tunes (like Jay Sean's \"Down,\" Smokey's \"Tracks Of My Tears\", some songs en Espaol (\"Todo Cambi,\" \"Qu Tengo Que Hacer\" and others), and originals that are really great!My favorite song is David Pinto's \"You Own My All.\" Lilty and fun, it has the Jason Mraz \"I'm Yours\" feel  and has a great sound. (Mraz's song did not make this album if you were wondering.)I love how their voices create such intricate instrumental sounds. It's all quite brilliant and Bobby McFerrin reminiscent. You will almost forget they are using only their voices because it sounds so good. I can't wait for their next album... I hope they record their mashup of \"Billie Jean\" and \"Love Stoned.\"Even if you're not yet a fan of NOTA, if you like a capella or the sound of Take 6 and Boyz II Men with a little flair en Espaol (or as they call it, \"NOTArized\"), you'll dig this album.\n", "val": 0.0214233435690403}
{"text": "Nota -- the winners of the underrated reality show \"The Sing-Off\" (summer 2009) -- is a fantastic a cappella group. They were absolutely my favorite group on the show, and I've been waiting ever since for their first CD. Here it is, and I'm not at all disappointed!The harmonies and vocal instrumentation (I'm not sure what to call it -- I mean when they use their voices to sound like instruments) are awesome. Check out \"I'm Down.\" When I first heard it, I said, \"That's not really a cappella! Those drums are real.\" But no, they are not -- these guys are doing everything with their voices.It's too bad this album doesn't include Jason Mraz's \"I'm Yours,\" which is one of the songs that helped Nota win \"The Sing-Off.\" Maybe that will show up on their second album. Meanwhile, we have some great covers (including an autotune-free version of the Black-Eyed Peas' \"I Gotta Feeling\") and three songs in Spanish (I love it when they sing in Spanish).This would be a great purchase for anyone who likes a cappella or Latino music.

{"text": "If you weren't familiar with Nota and just happened to buy this CD, you wouldn't even miss the instruments because you'd think they were there!I was excited when I heard that Nota's CD was finally out. They really put their stamp on these songs. When I first played this CD, I could hardly believe it was just the six of them singing. I'm writing my comments while listening to the CD so that I don't forget anything.Toward the end of \"I Gotta Feeling\", it sounds like a lot more people join in. Is it really just Nota? I really love the arrangement of this song - it's wonderful. \"Down\" is as great as I remember from the show. I like being able to picture them singing it. In fact, I'd love to have an accompanying DVD showing them singing all these songs so I can watch them. I know there are no instruments, but when the CD is on and I'm doing something else (like right now), I forget and keep thinking I hear real instruments, which I love. I'm enjoying getting to know \"Con Mi Nota En Do\", which is wonderfully done. I also love \"You Own My All\". I could do without \"Tears of a Clown\" but that's just personal preference. Nota does a good job on it. The \"guitar\" on \"This Love\" is amazing - it makes me laugh with delight to hear this song, because NO ONE would guess that this is a cappella. I love their arrangement of \"My Girl\" - the \"instruments\" and their singing voices. Right now I'm listening to \"Todo Cambio\" which is lovely. The birds and the ocean sounds at the start of \"Que Tengo Que Hacer\" are subtle and amazing. This, too, is a lovely song. Now \"Solo Sin Ti\" is on, which I'm enjoying. Again, they sound fantastic. And finally, \"I Need to Know\" is GREAT!I just love their sound, and I'm so proud of them for this accomplishment. It was fun getting to know them on the first season of the Sing-Off and it was a thrill to see them at the end of Season Two. I've now played the CD at least 10 times since I received it a couple days ago, and I'm not getting tired of it at all.

The only song on the whole album which captures the spirit of their performances on the Sing Off is the cover of My Girl, which saves the album from a 1 star rating.

Really, this song doesn't even deserve to be in the top 10 of any end of the year lists, except maybe the one on overrated songs.Kidding aside, maybe its because I never liked his style, but I really don't see why this song has been so successful.

{"text": "When it has came down to Cee-Lo, he has had some ups and downs as a singer. On his own or with Goodie Mob, he just hasn't been able to hit more of a mainstream shadow. Unlike his work with Gnarls Barkley, when he did Crazy and Smiley Faces, he was able not just to deliver a strong groove into his song, but he hit the big time as a recognizable act. The songs were good, but he hasn't had anything were he was able to makr his own mark after Gnarls Barkley called it a day. But that really changed with F*** You from his solo album The Lady Killer. The song actually brings in a nice take on a old school kind of soul. I really was surprised with the song. It really sounds good, and it is a better than most of the junk right now on radio from Rihanna and many other joke acts. I wonder what he is going to pull out of his next hat, and hopefully it can be stronger than a rabbit.Song: B\n", "val": 0.02000725269317627}

These days, pop music seems to generally be concerned with clubbing, as if nothing else is worth living for.

{"text": "While presenting nothing here that is truly new or visionary, it IS interesting to watch Ke$ha grow, here -- the speak-sing style seems to be exactly where she intends to stay. Still using auto-tune liberally, Ke$ha is now layering her vocal tracks with voice-doubles that are not effected, giving this particular song a much more natural feel. At 120 beat-per-minute and held within C-minor throughout, \"R\" was unquestionably written on keyboard. You can almost see her in your mind's-eye, writing this thing on a cheap old Casio keyboard sitting in Mom's basement. This is a song that could have been written in a half-hour at one of my sisters slumber parties -- Ke$ha is not pretending to be anything other than what she is, and that's very cool.Ke$ha's strongest suit is that her vocals are pure FUN; her vibe is always in good humor -- and she makes no pretense that she is doing anything other than simply that: HAVING FUN. She does, however, do it FEARLESSLY (even if awkwardly); she's pure fun presented with an absolute frankness -- almost daring critics to tear into her. I like that, and I like Ke$ha. Cannibal is a fine between-album effort; strong enough to maintain interest and generate a Top 10 single (or two) while she works on prepping her sophomore album. (\"R\" has managed to ring-up 2 million downloads, by the way... including a pair of weeks with 300,000+ downs each and one incredible week with with 400,000+ downs -- no question that \"R\" (and Cannibal) was exactly correct for the current marketplace between albums.)I'm actually pretty impressed with Ke$ha.Given her vocal limits (does she ever leave the octave...?!!), we might see this girl end-up with a monster of a career.Personally, I hope she turns-in a blazing follow-up; a strong next album could enable Ke$ha to see herself with a 50+ million album career, and I'd like to see that.A solid effort, here.4 stars.\n", "val": 0.028706690296530724}

That has came the case with her debut album Animal, and instead of trying to do something new, to make a better sound for herself, she instead chose to start all over again with We R WHo We R, the lead single from her sophmore album Cannibal. I really wasn't very impressed with the song at all. It really was just a waste of the ears from start to finish.

{"text": "Y&T is one of the great also-rans in hard rock with a career spanning almost forty years. They peaked briefly in the mid `80's but never recaptured their forward momentum and went into decline by the end of the decade. Fronted by guitarist Dave Menniketi who played a sizzling Les Paul guitar and drummer Leonard Haze, the band was rounded out by Philip Kennemore and second guitarist Joey Alves. When their fortunes did start to dive this venerable lineup was carved up eventually leaving only Menniketi. It's too bad because at the beginning of the `80's Y&T was making their best music but unfortunately it didn't translate into sales and headlining gigs outside of their native San Francisco. Still, respect must be given and their debut from late 1976 shows the promise of what could have made Y&T another Van Halen.  Self titled under their original moniker, the LP features several quality early metal songs such as future stage favorites \"25 Hours a Day\" and \"Alcohol\". \"Games Playing Woman\" and \"Come on Over\" are also terrific and \"Beautiful Dreamer\" closes the set in fine fashion in what would be a Y&T habit; finishing a record with a slow song (not always successfully).

They were a great band.  Not to take anything away from Y&T, but their earlier incarnation as Yesterday & Today was even better!  It is a shame that the sound quality on this album doesn't really do the band justice.  If memory serves, the original vinyl album suffered from the same defect.  The sound is a tad muted and the Haze's awesome bass drum doesn't resolve as well as one would like.It could be that the original recording wasn't state of the art (they were not a big name at the time) but I would love it if someone with some real talent could have a go at the original tapes and see if the sound could be improved.In my opinion this album is a must have for any rock fan.

{"text": "I know it sounds strange but there are two incarnations of this band.  The first is Yesterday and Today.  The second is Y&T.  The difference?  Yesterday and Today was a kick you right in your teeth band.  Stunning guitar playing by Dave M.  An \"open\" sound that allowed for Leonard Haze to fill in with inventive drumming that pulls you in like you can't believe.  Dave plays a flying V on the first album (self titled) that came out in 1976; I heard it that same year and could not believe my ears.  As Jimi Hendrix did, Dave combines his V with wah wah to stunning effect.  He has an incredible \"ringing\" sound to his guitar that the V is famous for . . . it is beautiful.  Dave pretty much moved away from his wah wah after that but this playing is extraordinary.  Next, on \"Struck Down\" Dave turned to a Les Paul.  Regardless, \"Struck Down\" is another masterpiece in my opinion.  Again, there's some \"air\" in the tempo of the songs that allows for a lot of creativity.  On their next LP \"Earthshaker\" they changed their name to Y&T; in my opinion a signal that their sound was going to change - this LP was a bridge between their previous sound and their new sound.  Their new sound depended much less on blistering guitar solos and pounding drums.  There was much more \"fill\" to the music in terms of rhythms and melodies.  The music in my opinion changed more to \"pump your fist in the air\" melodic music instead of \"kick your teeth in\" music.  They moved much more in the direction of rock ballads.  Please don't misunderstand; as a fan I am not judging but simply expressing my opinion.  Y&T pumped out quite a few good songs; no doubt.  However, for me personally there is NO substitute for their first two albums - the self titled \"Yesterday and Today\" and \"Struck Down.\"  These two in my mind are absolute hard rock classics that sear your brain.  These two make me want to run through the wall.\n", "val": 0.021113216876983643}

I've seen the band about 3 or 4 times and they never disappoint, they're a great live band and they deliver the goods. Drummer Leonard Haze kicks butt here. I have never heard a bass drum foot like his and that includes the great John Bonham. What he does in 25 Hours A Day with his right foot is simply amazing. There's a reason you don't hear many (if any) single pedal drummers play like that. They can't!If you want to get down with some old school hard rock this is the disc for you.

I went out and bought their album (remember those?) right away, and  was just as blown away. All the songs on the LP are tight, with fat chords,  searing leads and machine-gun drumming. My favorite songs are \"Fast  Ladies & Slow Gin\", \"Alcohol\" and  \"Earthshaker\". What impressed me the most, is the drumming of  Leonard Hays. Not since John Bonham have I heard such a FAST right foot!  And he is ONLY using his right foot... incredible!  This album is STILL one  of my favorites, even after 23 years, and I recommend it to anyone who  wants to escape to air guitar and air drum heaven. Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.012791499495506287}

{"text": "The Gift, Susan Boyle's sophomore album, presents the listener with another set of masterful performances by an artist who shows herself to be in complete command of her instrument. Every song is superbly crafted to showcase Boyle's satiny soprano to absolute perfection.Once again, as with her blockbuster debut I Dreamed A Dream, a somewhat eclectic mix of songs has been assembled, offering Boyle the chance to transform unexpected selections with her unique interpretations. Each song is delivered with delicacy and emotion. Boyle always manages to find the emotional core of her material, whether it be a pop classic like Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah or an oft-recorded Christmas standard. She is a master at eliciting an emotional response from her listeners that mirrors the feelings she expresses in song. Steve Mac, who produced both albums, understands that her voice should be the focal point of every song, and as with her debut he gives her the ideal setting to showcase her skills. The result is an album replete with songs polished to gem-like perfection.Boyle's version of Lou Reed's Perfect Day is another stunning reinterpretation along the lines of Wild Horses from her first album. Her sensitive and nuanced vocals elicit both the joy of remembered happiness and the melancholy longing for lost love. To the three pop songs offered - Perfect Day, Hallelujah and Don't Dream It's Over - she brings depth, subtle power and unexpected passion. The rich instrumental and choral accompaniment provide the base above which Boyle's sweet soprano soars. She builds to the climax of every song through intense yet controlled emotion. Boyle understands, as many do not, that the power of a performance can come as readily from a singer's expression of the complex emotions a song evokes as it can from the raw power of her voice.Even on what must be the millionth cover of Cohen's Hallelujah, Boyle manages to bring a surprising freshness. It is another song of love and loss, and her vocals are suffused with a regret that is tinged with anger. The result is an achingly beautiful rendition, the equal of any who has gone before her. Don't Dream It's Over is a more hopeful song, delivered with sensitivity. It is worth remarking that at the end the line, \"We know they won't win,\" is repeated several times, as if to emphasize the singer's own determination to triumph in spite of the bullies and the critics who at times have tormented her. Just as with her version of Madonna's You'll See, Don't Dream It's Over is an affirmation that she has proven her detractors wrong, but in place of the former's angry intensity there is quiet assurance.The other songs in the collection are for the most part Christmas classics. All of them are sung with a lovely reverence. O Holy Night and Away In A Manger are a standouts. Boyle's crystalline voice soars to worshipful heights, sweet and pure without being cloying. A traditional Scottish version of Auld Lang Syne offers a beautiful new interpretation that reinvigorates the Hogmanay (New Year's Eve) standard. The album ends on a grace note with an utterly beautiful rendition of O Come All Ye Faithful. To sum up, in The Gift Susan Boyle offers us a captivating album that provides a feast for both the senses and the soul.\n", "val": 0.030729269608855247}
{"text": "Susan Boyle's new CD \"The Gift\" is a Christmas album, despite the appearance of a few oddities like \"Perfect Day\", \"Hallelujah\", or \"Don't Dream Is Over\", but even these sound like they were recorded in a gargantuan cathederal and adorned with angelic choirs to fit in with the festive mood.She sings in a delicate higher register on \"Perfect Day\" and sounds much younger than her years. Seasonal favourites like \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" (a duet With Amber Stassi, herself a winner of a contest to appear on this CD and their voices go well together), an acoustic reading of \"The First Noel\", a reverent \"O Holy Night\", \"Away In A Manger\", \"Make Me A Channel Of Your Peace\", \"Auld Lang Syne\", and \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" complete the 10 track collection. Nothing earth shattering, but perfect for your Christmas stocking.\n", "val": 0.007167057599872351}
{"text": "Susan Boyle's honeyed, fairy godmother-like vocal presence pours over the 35 minutes of \"The Gift\" with grace, restraint and high levels of listenability. It has all the effortless warmth of a loving embrace - an apt trait for a Christmas recording.She has a talent only a select few vocalists have had - the seemingly effortless ability to sing with profound sincerity, depth and knowledge - not intellectual knowledge, but emotional knowledge - the kind Karen Carpenter had, for instance. There is not a trace of smugness or self-interest in the way she sings, which makes her stand out from the majority of recent young performers whose performances make them appear to be their own biggest fans.While they sing for their own self-adulation and gain, Boyle is one of the rare ones who sing for the listener with earnestness. From phrase to phrase she gives of herself. It is not just for her sake.The song selections are enough to set \"The Gift\" apart from other holiday albums. Boyle's reinterpretation of Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day\" favors an optimistic reading of its ambiguous lyrics, bringing devotion - either of a religious or familial kind - to the forefront, with a gorgeous, powerful choir and superb musicians. She also injects Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" with subtle, delicate grace. The lyrics and their meanings ring clear. She sings like a painter paints, with care and attention to detail. Her love for the material shows.This also shows in her unexpected, profoundly stirring take on Crowded House's career-hit \"Don't Dream It's Over.\" The original was contemplative, moody and chilly, with Neil Finn's desperate, anguished delivery. He sounded like he was trying to stop someone on the brink of making a fatal mistake. Boyle, on the other hand, reimagines the song as one of strength, protection and affirmation - of renewed possibilities on a sunny horizon.\"Auld Lang Syne\" benefits from its simple, unaffected arrangement that lets Boyle's voice take center stage. This stands in contrast to the pillowy, over-eager production values that both obscure her voice and reveal its limitations where they need not. However, this occurs on a limited basis, and her talent overcomes it.\"O Holy Night\" suits Boyle's voice ideally, and she sings the song - which tempts many singers into hammy bombast - with class and generosity.  \"Make Me a Channel of Your Peace,\" which is more customary as a church hymn, is similarly soothing and restful. Boyle finds great strength from choosing simple truth over trite embellishment, making the title of the song especially apt.Boyle has put her talent to fine use on \"The Gift.\" The richness of her voice and her uncensored, heart-on-sleeve quality lend themselves to Christmas as naturally as cookies and milk, creating a comforting, elegant (albeit brief) album to enjoy for many holidays to come.\n", "val": 0.02259703539311886}
{"text": "While this is obviously a Christmas album, it contains a few songs that you wouldn't necessarily expect to find on such an album. Nevertheless, Susan seems to have known what she was doing in selecting those songs as they sit comfortably alongside the Christmas classic. The mood and tempo is mellow, just like her debut album.The Christmas songs do not include a reprise of Silent night (featured on her debut album) but include four other well-worn carols - The first Noel, O holy night, Away in a manger and O come all ye faithful. Susan sings all four superbly as you would expect, always sticking to the traditional arrangement. Anybody who has heard Susan sing and who is also familiar with these songs (that's most if not all of the people who ever read this review) will know exactly what to expect. Another well-worn classic, though more for New Year than Christmas, is Auld lang syne. My only regret here is that it was included as the penultimate track rather than being the closing track. Still, that's a minor quibble. Among the Christmas songs, the most interesting from my perspective is Do you hear what I hear? Not only is it less familiar than the four carols (though I've heard a fair number of versions even of this song) but it is here by Susan and Amber Stassi. I don't think I've ever heard it sung as a duet before, but it works well.The other songs include Perfect day (a cover of Lou Reed's classic song), Hallelujah (a cover of one of Leonard Cohen's songs, that may at first glance seem a bit depressing for a Christmas album, but it`s OK by me), Don't dream it's over (a cover of a Crowded House song, which Susan included to put people in a party mood, but it is mellow just like the rest of the album) and Make me a channel of your peace, which is a hymn based on the prayer of St Francis of Assisi. A closer comparison of the lyrics shows that it only uses some of the prayer. Those of you who remember Margaret Thatcher's first election victory in 1979 may recall that also quoted from the same prayer (and people will have their own opinions as to whether she lived up to her quote or not) but she quoted partly from different parts of the prayer.The inclusion of some unusual selections make this a more interesting album than if she'd stuck to repertoire of obvious Christmas classics throughout. It is a great mellow Christmas album, ideally suited to those quieter moments during the festive season.\n", "val": 0.005831852089613676}

She also does nice renditions of \"Perfect Day,\" \"O Holy Night\" and the lesser-known \"Make Me a Channel of Your Peace.\"The minuses are that most of the arrangements - while beautiful - are a bit on the slow side (such as \"Hallelujah\"), and there are other times when the choir and orchestra almost drown out her pretty voice.Even so, this album is a perfect addition to your Christmas music collection - one I would highly recommend.\n", "val": 0.025333015248179436}

{"text": "Susan's wonderful voice is back and she shows the ability to adapt to new styles and arrangements. I would recommend this album to anyone who believes that a voice as great as hers should be celebrated. Her Producers however does not seem to know what they have, as her voice is very poorly recorded and the mix doctored with all the trick you might use to fill in the blanks with a lesser talent. They did not bother getting her a suitable microphone so all cuts are marred by sibilance which to boot have been put through amateurish and excessive amount of electronic reverberation and a phase-synthesizer with the result that it sounds even worse. This is a \"get rich quick\" production where they did not stop the train to get it right, for example \"Don`t dream it`s over\" which I feel she sings very well, sounds worse whenever the piano is on because of some pretty nasty digital noise artifacts in that recording channel which causes even more inter-modulation distortion in the sibilance range. The Phase processing further seems to be added last as it causes horrible clipping of the signal, which because it is artificial and unrelated to the core signal makes you speakers spit and sputter even worse (I'll spare you the long technical explanation of why this is a \"No No\" as you can hear it quite easily). In an interview with Hitquarters.com in April 2010 the producer of this album Steve Mack said: \"As soon as the producer starts thinking they're bigger than the artist then you tend to have a few problems.\" I take it that he has decided that he was mistaken and put the mixer on auto to meet some deadline. That's a shame because I think that if they had let Susan sing on her own terms A Capella in a nice church with good acoustics that they could have saved a lot of money and produced a record for all seasons.

{"text": "All of `The Gift' is all about the beauty of Christmas - about restoring Christ to the celebration - aboutgiving innocent purity to the world.Susan Boyle sings The Christmas Story with beautiful grace and reverence. Her voice mirrors thehushed silence of the grand night and makes the events come alive. All the Christmas Carols and Hymn sungare soft, and gentle, tender and peaceful like a lullabye. All `The Gift' songs united sound as one song like astring of pearls of great price strung on a silver thread. Or they are like the strings on a musical violin or harpplucked to give beautiful notes. Mary - Jesus' Mother is singing this sweet lullaby to her newborn while sittingon a pile of hay in the stable. She holds this new little life close, rocking back and forth for to sleep, cooing tosooth his tiny cries. With milk she nourishes him. The chorus of the mooing cows, bleating sheep and brayingdonkey is the choir that chimes in by an unseen cue. Mary ponders deep inside her heart the joy from the goodevents of today - the most perfect day in her life. She knows even in the midst of surrounding ominous turmoilwhen the soldiers come soon and later, He will never let her go and she's glad. For the moment he's hers alone,but she knows pain deep inside as someday He must be given away. Susan's magnificent voice captures the joyand sorrow of Mary's soul with high crystal and low velvet notes. She makes Mother Mary audible.Mary's memory recalls what the Angel Gabriel said - many will rise and call her blessed to be a meansof God's peace. The heavenly messenger's words will come true as she receives from what she's done today- birthed the Savior of the world. She has been honored to participate in the ministry of freedom, peace, goodwill to mankind this hour old infant of hers will have someday. With bread and wine He will nourish her. Butfor now - thus far the greatest moment in time, it truly is a perfect day. This thrills her soul. Heaven has cometo earth and she got to be a part by God's favor. Susan sings Mary's Song. Susan reflects in her voice theintense desire of Mary's heart to show His peace to the world. Mary and Susan are chosen like a duet.With raptures of love she sings the word of praise, Hallelujah, to God in her natural language ofHebrew. She sings this word over and over and over. She begins to feel, to sense His presence and glory,the ultimate human experience. It doesn't matter what her weaknesses, sins have been - she's released; theMessiah's here with her. Before she was alone, but not now He's come. What a relief - in tears it draws herbreath away as she exhales the final Hallelujah. When Susan sings this word the other words don't matter asthe listener begins to be surrounded by the Lord's presence responding to her worship. Susan sings the essence.Mary knows Jesus will never leave or forsake her in hard times. He was tucked safely under her heart,now he's next to her heart and in the future He'll be in her heart. She knows the enemy of the soul can nevererect a barrier between her and her son, the one who is the Son of God. The child she bore will inspire her towin. They will be together forever. She never has to think it's over. He will not forget her, as she will alwaysbe his Mother and believes - his friend. They will both recall the fun times of his youth when the seas andstorms come. Susan has conveyed the love heart of Mary for her son, for God's Son - their emotions.Mary, loving Mother, did on the first Christmas Day what God, loving Father, has done on everyChristmas Day since then. He sings to us with joy in His heart for the Gift given, His Savior Son. God's Loveis like a mother's love for her tiny babe - soft, gentle, tender and peaceful to bring comfort. Holds us in Hisarms while rocking back and forth. Thus it truly is a perfect day no matter what. Susan sings God's lullabye.Her duet with Amber Sasse is very lovely blending in rich harmony asking the question each soul mustanswer. And, Susan Boyle has so delicately yet with underlying spiritual strength brought the true messageof Christmas back into the realm of reality. Christ is Christmas. He is the Messiah, God come to each oneof us. She sings like the host of angels singing to the shepherds abiding in the field, the Good News - God'sredemption to humanity by His Baby Boy. Like the crystal clear night so very long ago, her beautiful goldenmellow soaring voice rings forth to bring the happy sounds of Christmas. From her heart she brings the listenerinto her world of love for the Holy Day as she sings of the glorious wonder. Mary singing to her baby son andSusan singing to the world is like a lullabye. Susan weaves all the songs on the album to make the fabric ofthe theme, the expression of God's love to all people through His instrument of peace. Each song is a threadcomposing the tapestry. By this album called `The Gift' God is glorified, Christ is restored to His first dayand Mary's Song of praise to God is sung.* Susan Boyle brings this all home as her most beautiful of voicesreflects the Gift of Love to us all in a whisper. `The Gift' by Susan Boyle is destined to become a Christmasclassic. *{Holy Bible Luke 1 ~ Penned by Patricia Ann Vance 11-17-10}\n", "val": 0.045044973492622375}
{"text": "What a load of old tat. Her first album was bad enough but this one beats mustard tea as an emetic. Her voice is nothing to rave about.

This is just a money making scam by Syco to con the punters into thinking they are buying genuine silver only to find when they get it home it is just a poor quality EPNS. If she intends to continue to launch this kind of tosh then the sooner the good ship SuBo sinks the better.\n", "val": 3.62666069122497e-05}
{"text": "Okay, boring doesn't EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW BAD THIS CD IS! Her singing is so UNREMARKABLE. Not bad, not good, just indescribably indescribable. There are so many hysterical comments on here from both sides of the argument, that are way too strong. There is nothing remarkable about this album to rant or rave about. No outstanding vocals, nothing terrible about the background production. Probably the only rant or criticism I can come up with may be pandering to the masses. There is nothing remotely near taking a chance or being creative anywhere. First, give her looks a break. The only amazing thing about the whole story is that she has been wildly successful with her looks, that is truly unbelievable. I think it just speaks of how we are probably totally lacking in quality, wholesome entertainment, as teen star after teen star turns into a wreck by age 19. But I am not joining the ranks of bashing our stars for their talent, looks, or anything else. Then I read the person who brought up the $5.99 Amazon sale price, so I was curious about that. Taylor is selling for $12.99. Wow. I am now wondering who is buying this CD. Not one looking to indulge sophisticated taste for sure. But then it is Pop Music. But who says pop music has to be boring? Well not Lady Ga-Ga.... I am no expert on any of this, necessarily, but Mariah still does sing like an angel on her MCII. Susan, fine to good, but no, nowhere near angelic. So, her next offering, will someone in the biz try to make an interesting piece of art with her.

{"text": "Susan Boyle is a sweet and matronly woman with a touching and inspiring story.  That said, I don't quite understand how anyone with a modicum of musical knowledge can revere this album, or frankly, Ms. Boyle as a performer.  Her breath control is atrocious, her phrasing is dull and listless, and the album is overproduced in an attempt to emulate Celine Dion, or authentic Celtic performers like Orla Fallon.  The reason she is \"breathy\" is because she has virtually no control over her instrument, as is indicated by the forced vibrato that she applies to every note.  The songs were virtually identical in tone; and the butchering of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' in an attempt to make it more holiday friendly is ridiculous.  Aren't there plenty of beautiful holiday songs to choose from?  Is it really necessary to take a song and eliminate half of the verses so it can apply to your holiday message?  I applaud Ms. Boyle for her strength and resilience in the face of a business that is more about commercialism and appearances than it is about hard work and talent, but I sincerely hope that this Gift is the last one I'll be receiving from Ms. Boyle in a long, long time.\n", "val": 0.00026590426568873227}

{"text": "Susan Boyle's \"The Gift\" is an ideal CD for the holidays. I just love to listen to her beautiful voice. If I were Elaine Paige I'd be honored and very proud to see that I had inspired such a natural talent to keep on working hard for more than 30 years to become a self-made, professional singer like Susan Boyle did! \"The Gift\" is very well produced and showcases the gift that Susan's mother encouraged Susan to share with the world.What most people don't realize is that Susan's entire life was spent preparing for the moment caught on that viral Youtube video of Susan's performance on Britain's Got Talent in 2009. Nearly ten years prior, in 1999, Susan actually spent her entire savings to make a professionally produced demo which she used in an attempt to be discovered for her natural singing talent. It is very unfortunate that Susan didn't have the same advantages that some of her inspriratations had such as natural beauty and wealthy parents to help her start a professional career at an early age. However, it is truly refreshing to see that more than 30 years of hard work and internal drive can eventually pay off.I highly recommend viewing Susan Boyle's 1984 video and listening to her 1999 demo songs as well as the charity CD with her performance. You can find a night club performance from 1984 where her proud parents appear to be in the front row! After you do, I think you'll also be sold on this amazing new star's charm and talent! Susan Boyle is truly a self made success and I will continue to be a fan as long as she continues to sing![...]\n", "val": 0.030649209395051003}

{"text": "Had not purchased Susan's previous album, but heard one of these songs on Larry King Live final episode (closing scene). Wife purchased on a whim checking out next day at Whole Foods.  What interests me about Boyle is that she is the first real \"crossover\" soprano with wide appeal. This genre started by producer David Foster with tenors the likes of Andrea Bocelli, Michael Bubl, and Josh Groban.  It's all about mass appeal. Look at what Foster did with Peter Cetera after he left the band Chicago. Killer ballads that made women (and many men) melt behind a similar 1/100,000,000 voice. Suddenly he opened a new market for a former pop/rock lead singer, more \"mainstream\" and hence greater sales. About this album, it's great, well sequenced, with a nice mix of traditional and contemporary songs, all well arranged.\n", "val": 0.04145688936114311}

{"text": "Sure I'ver heard of Susan Boyle, her sudden rise to fame in the UK and all, but I really hadn't paid much attention to the whole story and really wasn't interested to listen to much of her music.  But when I did listen to some snippets of her Christmas album I was impressed enough to go ahead and pick the CD.  And I was quite happy with what I've heard.  For the most part, just about any Christmas album won't be particularly unique in its contents if it presents any form of the Christmas classics.  It's fair to say the same for this one, but Ms. Boyle has a very beautiful voice and has put together some very nice renditions of a few Christmas classics while at the same time including some choices that are not the typical Christmas carol.  I'm not certain how it was decided to include the old '80s hit from Crowded House, Don't Dream It's Over, but she covers it very well.  Not sure a comparison can be made between her style and the pop rock version, but she's definitely made it work for her.

{"text": "Susan Boyle's second CD, just released for Christmas shoppers I suppose, it quite a disappointment. First the music selections which she says in her notes she is not responsible for-- or said another way: \"I wish to thank the following in helping me with this album: Simon Cowell and Nick Raymonds for picking the songs.\" The front cover has a picture of the Star of Bethlehem so we are to assume the CD is a Christmas one. Not completely. Also included with \"O Holy Night,\" \"Away In a Manager,\"O Come All Ye Faithful\" and other Christmas selections are Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day,\" Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\"-- while I love this piece, it's been recorded to death and Ms. Boyle's interpretation adds no new dimension to it-- and \"Make Me A Channel of Your Peace.\"Then there are the arrangements. What on earth were they thinking? Did nobody listen to what was the final product before unleashing it onto the public? The background music gets so loud at times that it is impossible to set the proper volume setting on whatever you are playing this CD on. The liner notes indicate that we have a piano, keyboards, synths, organ, guitars, drums, accordion (the fruitcake of instruments), with soloists, Children's Choir, Young Musicians and Classical Choir although it is difficult to really tell what is going on with these really awful arrangements. I suppose we blame either the mixer, producer and arranger, orchestral and choral arranger or all of the above-- certainly not the poor singer. I kept wanting to hear Ms. Boyle singing with just a piano and maybe a cello or violin to accompany her. Now that would have been something to hear.What keeps this CD from being totally without redemption is the glorious silver voice of Ms. Boyle. She deserves better as do her fans. Had I had the opportunity to hear this CD in the store, I would hever have purchased it.\n", "val": 4.579485903377645e-05}

D. Howe - See all my reviewsThis review is from: The Gift (Audio CD)This newest album presents a triumph of managers and controllers. Susan is allowed to sing only slow, mournful songs in a strength barely above a whisper. Where she is allowed to expand a bit, the electronically-enhanced choir and the electronic accompaniment are elevated in volume to a level which all but eclipses Susan. This isn't fair to her. One has the impression that the handlers and managers are afraid of her breaking loose. I re-looked at her first performance on that stage in the talent show. She showed personal strength and character, and she put herself into that song. But even the same song professionally-reproduced in her first album simply has lost -- well -- Susan's own personality. She has power and personality. These should burst forth and bring goosebumps to us on such songs as \"Hallalujah!\" and \"O Come All Ye Faithful\". Instead, the latter song -- which should be the glorious wrapup to the album -- instead is a mournful dirge which ends, as one might say, not with a bang but a whimper. I don't think the producers have been fair to Susan, and I think their slick marketing of this album shows they're more interested in their suffocating production than in their showcasing of a fine performer. Just leave Susan to her own enormous talent on the next one. Remember, she stood alone on the stage when she gave the best performance of all.

{"text": "I have to agree with others who have scored the album low. Susan's voice, when it comes through is beautiful, and the arrangements are beautiful. But the mixing on this album ruins everything. The music drowns her out, the choir is too loud and drowns her out as well. The company could do us all a favor by recalling all of the CD's sold, remixing the album and giving us an album that show cases Susan's voice rather than the music and the choir. The producer of the album failed Susan and all of us as customers.Also, while I like the song, Hallelujah is hardly a christmas or holiday song. I don't see how it fits with the idea of \"The Gift\" we celebrate on Christmas.Ed FordAddition contrast: I just heard an album of Christmas music by Kathleen Battle - I am not comparing the 2 singers. Both albums were by a female singer that has a wonderful voice, both feature background instruments, both included choirs. The difference is in the mixing. Kathleen's album show cases her talent and voice with the instruments and choir supporting her. The mixing on Susan's album show cases everything but her voice with the exception of Auld Land Syne which only uses a piano. Susan was truly cheated on this album.Ed\n", "val": 3.8288842915790156e-05}

{"text": ".... this nobody sings a marginal \"I dreamed a dream,\" and because she was so unbecoming to look at, the world was in awe that she did have a powerful voice. However, the more you listen, the more you realize people love the story. The voice isn't that special. Now this release, is marred by random programing, and this time around someone overproduced her voice. So, we have a cross between the voice of the Little Mermaid, and an overproduced voice that still has some pitch issues. Then, there is the issue of phrasing. As mot people today don't bother with such things as musicality, phrasing doesn't matter. She looks like a hobo, sings like a talented church choir singer, but really her little charm was taken from her by the producer of this muddled collection of songs presented by a voice nothing close to what audiences fell in love with. I was never fond of her in the first place, but I do love a good story and was touched by her initial performance. Next go-round, get back to the earthy sound, learn something about phrasing (actually she did phrase well initially, just this disc seems to find her musically lost). There might be a place for her as a true artist (just because she is #1 selling album doesn't mean she is a great musician, rather a great story). However, I think she has the goods if she will get with the right folks and stay away from this type of production. Listen to Annie Lennox on her new Christmas Album then this disc. This will give you an idea of what Ms. Boyle lacks. Artistry. I wish her the best in future endeavors, but I am afraid this one is a miss.\n", "val": 0.00010420013859402388}

{"text": "We just love Susan Boyle in my house. We saw her first major TV performance. Frankly, we felt for her as the audience cat-called and hissed, even unkindly commented and chuckled at her... untilshe began to sing. Her beautiful singing brought tears to our eyes. Clearly, we were hearing music from the soul singing of a woman who knew well life's cruelties and the loneliness often shallow modern life condemns so many to suffer.In this age of hot babe star singers who are better at getting into trouble & being outrageous in public than they are at singing, we had given up on ever seeing a truly talented singer making it in the big time. The last good, kind and unusually talented one of a kind singer I know of is long forgotten in most countries, especially her own land of America. Julie London is her name. The first popular international singing star. She was the rage in the 1950s. So forgotten by the 1970s that she was wrongly listed as deceased. She did not pass until this century! Perhaps if she had been bad and outrageous like slightly talented lead singer of the Doors or flashy & borderline vulgar like Monroe, drug addicted like the no-talent Grateful Dead or tone deaf Janis Joplin,or an ass like no-voice Sinatra Americans would remember Julie London.Yet, here was Susan Boyle, profoundly talented, gentle, clearly Godly! American flirtation with the intolerances of extreme ideology forbids the media from accurately reporting Susan is mentally retarded. Instead, they must restrict themselves to \"learning disabled\". She must be protected.Fortunately, fellow Brits Pers Morgan & Simon Cowell understand this and seem to try to mentor her. Already, family members who had neither time nor much tolerance for her attempt to exploit her sudden wealth. I pray her managers get a special trust put aside, structured so that no matter what happens she will be financially taken care of for life.She is a unique individual with a rare unique gift forged and tuned by the school of life. More than that, Susan Boyle is a British national treasure.Her singing and her person brings joy into our lives.My only criticism is that her CDs have a little too much modern professional production. She doesn't need it. Cute, elfish but minor music talent Taylor Swift needs electronic voice tricks, such as multiple playbacks of her own voice to accompany her singing to make her voice richer & greater-than-life than it is... The likes of Swift- who rarely sings. She 99% talks- need all the electronic tricks and enhancements she can get. (She proved at the Grammys in her bad duet attempt with seasoned stage pro Stevie Nicks that she cannot sing). Most wealthy celebrity singers today sound like greatly enhanced \"singing\" teenagers in a Disney World amusement singing booth.Susan Boyle is the real deal. Modern high tech gets between Boyle's talent and the listener. She also doesn't need tunes carefully hand picked and produced for her. Let her pick the songs. Let her carry the tune alone. We will thank you for letting us hear the rare talent of Susan Boyle at home, on CD.\n", "val": 0.004626058973371983}

She has overcome that part of her life and I admire her enormously. I can't imagine what it must be like to come from a small town in a council owned home to global fame. She is a gift in herself and I will be giving many people this CD for their holidays. I will never forget her appearance on Britain's Got Talent with the whistles and derisive laughter.

{"text": "I have been impressed with Susan Boyle from the moment I saw the YouTube clip of her Britain Has Talent debut. I have played, and played, and played her DVD, always enjoying her wonderful, soaring voice. I waited eagerly for this latest DVD, especially as I love Christmas music, and she only had one, Silent Night, on her previous DVD. However, I was disappointed. Not disappointed enough to give it less than four stars, but I feel that those who put this DVD together did not do Ms. Boyle any favors. The richness, the soaring nature of her voice is what has captured her audience.In this latest DVD, The Gift, her voice has been restricted for some reason, kept very low key. She also holds notes less frequently, seeming to bounce on them rather than lift them up. Now I know she can lift her notes, so what has been suggested to her here? In addition, because her voice is much softer, more low key, the music often drowns her out. Also, does she really need the back up singers, and so, so, so many? She proved on that large expanse of stage at Britain Has Talent that she can hold her own. Nearly everyone who heard her was brought to tears, so why all the filler now. Her voice can stand alone, as she has shown.I was also disappointed that all the pieces on the DVD were not Christmas ones. I know that the leaflet that accompanies the DVD explains her rationale, but I would have preferred her to stay with Christmas and perhaps perform some lesser known pieces, or even Greensleeves, for her voice would be wonderfully suited to that. We have so many wonderful Celtic Christmas pieces that she could have done. I don't know whether the choices were truly her own or were suggested to her, but she lost a star from me because of these choices.I hope she is able to put out another DVD, for her story and journey has captured so many people's imaginations. I would buy another one, but I probably would anticipate it a little less, for I wouldn't be sure what will have been done to her voice. I want to original Susan Boyle back.

The album is pleasant and A Perfect Day sticks with you, but it truly does not present Susan at her best.

Listening to her sing \"O Holy Night\" and \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" will put you in the true Holiday Spirit.  God Bless you Susan Boyle and never stop singing.\n", "val": 0.0616963766515255}

{"text": "One of my very favourite moments in the history of providing the Official Room 101 of Amazon was my review of Susan Boyle's debut album, that two ton turd of a record that had idiots falling over themselves trying to praise it, with laughable and often baffling use of hyperbole to describe Susan's voice, as if hearing it could cure the sick, make Israel and Palestine have a group-hug and drag Princess Diana back from Hell.And so slating it (as, indeed, it richly deserved) was ever so much fun, simply for the upset and anger it caused to the musically ignorant and reality show brainwashed. So, with that in mind, there was no way I was going to miss the opportunity of reviewing her new album. Especially when, and get this, it's easily worse than the first.Described as a \"Gift to her fans\" (I don't remember ever having to PAY for a gift before..?), the makers of this album seem to think that slowing every song down so damn much that it barely has a pulse, then adding a backing orchestra = haunting beauty. When in fact, all it does is make quite possibly the most boring album of the year. Boyle's voice is admittedly nice enough, but there's no way she can hold your attention for more than a minute, especially on these flat and, frankly, tedious songs.And whilst before it was the Stone's \"Wild Horses\" being given the Boyle treatment, this time its Lou Reed's dedication to being ripped to the gills on heroin, Perfect Day. Somehow the stripped back charm and honesty of the original is lost in Boyle's brainless, overblown honk. There's no depth in the vocal, no sense of humility in the \"I wish I was someone else, someone good\" line - nothing. She could be reading the back of a Cornflakes box for the range of emotion she gives out here.Oh, and look - there's also 2008's X Factor song, Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\", for the 12 people in the world who aren't sick to death of it by now. It's funny the phrase \"you don't really care for music, do ya?\" is still included, as it pretty much sums up the mentality of anyone who actually buys these horrible records in the first place.Anyway, throw in another cover of Crowded House's \"Don't Dream It's Over (when listening to it, that's all I did) and six Christmas carols that will, honestly, have you weeping into your hands and eying up that bottle of bleach under the sink. Your life has not hit rock bottom until you sit through \"Away in a Manger\" (seriously, that is actually on this album) by Susan Boyle.The real facepalm moment comes in at the third track, as its a duet with newcomer Amber Stassi. You won't know who she is, so let me explain. Susan put out a \"search for a star\" style competition to find the New Susan Boyle. Quite how you entered that, I'm not sure. How DO you become the New Susan Boyle? Surely sending the application form back covered in your own drool and excrement would've been a good start. So it's as syrupy, over produced and dead inside as every other song on this wretched album. \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" Sure do, Susan - that's me vomiting into the sink.Here's the thing; Susan Boyle seems like a fairly fun, jolly woman, that is when she's removed from the flashing lights and media hooplah that make you think she's going to cause a riot like a hairier King Kong. So the idea of removing all sense of fun and frivolity from her and instead replacing it with Super Serious Susan is actually a dis-service to the woman herself. She says that she wanted to create an album dedicated to the music of her youth. That's fine. But if anyone's youth was as barren and boring as the music here, they'd have emptied a shotgun barrel into their mouths by now. I'm not saying Boyle should be body-popping or beat boxing, but Hells bells, give her a song with at least a BIT of kick to it. Is that really so much to ask?To newcomers who want to see what all the fuss is about - do NOT be fooled by the hype, the sales or the salivating, urine-stained drones on this website. Susan has a nice, if not great, voice, and it's lost and wasted on yet another album of dreary, imagination-free cover versions. Whoever you are, you deserve better than that.\n", "val": 3.1071071134647354e-05}

{"text": "As one who has not heard the voice of Susan Boyle before, it may be unfair to judge a talent on the basis of one recording.  However, in looking for the seasonal recordings to recommend, this one, THE GIFT, certainly has to be considered because of the overwhelming popularity of Miss Boyle and the consistently high sales of her recordings.  The voice is pleasant and communicative and honest and that is refreshing.  The few songs that are offered here do not a full album make, but Boyle does give a lovely rendition of the light popular voice offering Christmas wishes. She is not to be compared with classical singers because that is simply not her category.  And while many music lovers of all kinds of singing voices will and have snapped up the Christmas albums of, say,  Jessye Norman, Kathleen Battle, Kiri Te Kanewa etc etc, that is not to say this little recording is not worth adding to the collection.

My only complaint with 'Hallelujah' is it's WAY too slow, but the way she sings it is wonderful; I've always liked the song.  *** Another note on that:  In Susan's note in the CD, she says (well, the letter is signed by her), that 'Hallelujah' is loosely based on \"Sampson and Delilah\".  No, it's loosely based on David and Bathsheba with a reference to Samson (no p) getting his hair cut.  David observed Bathsheba bathing in the moonlight from his roof; he was a king, Samson was not.  David was the 'baffled king composing hallelujah' (he wrote most of the psalms -a book of praise).  I guess my little snit about that has nothing to do with the music, but Sony surely has enough money to proof Susan's note that would be copied in the MILLIONS.Susan, I've purchased both your CD's --now next time make the hair stand up on my arms with that voice of yours.\n", "val": 0.0009034788818098605}

Many feared that as this was written 'on the road' that it would suffer greatly and be incohesive as a whole. In fact, the very opposite is true. This is an album of importance and sheer audacity. Susan has freed herself of the chains of commercialism and expectation and let her crusty black flag of despair unfurl. This is a huge statement from an important artist. This is a materpiece.With song titles like 'I Wish I'd Killed The Minister' and 'Monsoon's Revenge'. Susan has truly revealed herself to the listener here.

I've tried a variety of equalizer settings but I can't seem to overcome the production value.  I think part of the problem on this CD is that the songs are \"soft\" songs intended to be sung with a soft voice. There is way too much background reverb throughout the CD.  I just don't think the production staff are doing their best for Susan.  Probably the best person to produce Susan's next CD would be Richard Carpenter.

Where she is allowed to expand a bit, the electronically-enhanced choir and the electronic accompaniment are elevated in volume to a level which all but eclipses Susan.  This isn't fair to her.  One has the impression that the handlers and managers are afraid of her breaking loose.  I re-looked at her first performance on that stage in the talent show.  She showed personal strength and character, and she put herself into that song.  But even the same song professionally-reproduced in her first album simply has lost -- well -- Susan's own personality.  She has power and personality.  These should burst forth and bring goosebumps to us on such songs as \"Hallalujah!\" and \"O Come All Ye Faithful\".  Instead, the latter song -- which should be the glorious wrapup to the album -- instead is a mournful dirge which ends, as one might say, not with a bang but a whimper.  I don't think the producers have been fair to Susan, and I think their slick marketing of this album shows they're more interested in their suffocating production than in their showcasing of a fine performer.

{"text": "The Gift is a Christmas album and as such it is better than most because it has the voice of the century, which even at 50% vocal power is still better than that of any other pop star. I can use words like genuine and honest and soothing to describe the tracks because Boyle is able to connect with the audience and get an emotional reaction like no other. This CD as well as the last CD has to be listened to, preferably with a good sound system; it is not \"background music\". It helps to watch her new \"Perfect Day\" video and to read the lyrics for \"Don't Dream its Over\" to get the multilayered messages. Hallelujah is a little too slow for my taste.I do have the same concerns some of the other reviewers have here. As we all know, she can sing just about any style and I fear she is moving in the wrong direction while she is \"finding her voice.\" The CDs are overproduced, the emotion has been sacrificed at the expense of a pretty young sound, and there is a hint that she is moving toward that obnoxious whisper-warbling sound that less talented singers have to use. Susan surprised us all in the audition, not because of her appearance but because she can sing with a rich sustained voice even when singing quietly. The world has overwhelmingly told her after the live performances of Wild Horses and IDAD that this is the voice that grabs them and what they will spend money on. For her next album, hopefully some of the tracks will be recorded live with an audience, there will be a mix of styles and tempos, and she will get back to that powerful straight from the heart sound.\n", "val": 0.014820437878370285}
{"text": "Susan sings in her Christmas album her faith. It is beautiful and to compare it to a pop star singing Christmas songs is silly. Some reviewers have commented that not all the songs are Christmasy but then many Christmas albums also have songs that are not specifically Christmas but fit the season and its message.

Enjoying her debut CD as much as I did, I couldn't wait to hear this new offering, BUT....despite the lovely choirs who bring a great deal to the songs on the CD and Susan's still lovely, angelic voice, in my humble ears, there just wasn't enough of it!I think that most people who hear Susan Boyle sing, (and unless one has been unconscious the last couple of years and hasn't heard her voice on tv and elsewhere), would agree she has both that gentle and the powerfully majestic range that knocks your socks off in its sheer beauty.I can't say I completely disliked \"The Gift\" because, all things considered, it was nice to listen to.....just not totally worthy of bringing her incredible talent to the listening world.\n", "val": 0.007157884072512388}

{"text": "Susan Boyle has given listeners a gift that is right in time for the holiday season.My favorite track on this album is \"The First Noel.\" This song features beautiful acoustic guitar playing that compliments Susan Boyle's voice perfectly.  The violin playing adds a pretty tone to this track too.  \"Hallelujah\" is one of most of the covered songs out there, but Susan's rendition of this song is special and uplifting.  I love the goregous piano playing on this track.  \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" is another highlight here. This is the best Christmas duet I have ever heard.  Amber Stassi has a very pretty voice.  \"Auld Lang Syne\" is a song that puts me in a sentimental mood.  I think about all the friends I have lost this year when I listen to this song.  Susan Boyle's cover is moving.  She makes this song her own, and that is a mark of a talented singer.  I am not a very religious person, but I love the way Susan sings \"O Holy Night\" and \"Away In A Manger\"  These  song give me chicken skin.  My least favorite track is \"Don't Dream It's Over\".  This song did not move me as the others.  I have never heard of \"Make Me A Channel of Your Peace\".  This song makes me feel peaceful.

'I Dreamed a Dream' was a pleasant album to listen to, though by no means revolutionary, yet most people were not bothered by this given that the album's muse was in here late forties.  On&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Gift/dp/B003GAMPWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Gift</a>, Boyle similarly doesn't ruffle any feathers, but go `round, people take notice of the `lack of flair' about 'The Gift.'  Sure, Boyle sounds beautiful, but even at times this is compromised if for no other reason than the overly safeness of the performances and the blandness of the material from this album.  Even more confusing may be the fact that 'The Gift' tries to `have cake and eat it too' by poising itself as `holiday' effort that also includes a couple of neutral pop numbers.  The results are not quite a flop (and it won't fill like a flop to Boyle's more committed fan base), but an album that produces only mixed results as opposed to being valedictory.Boyle starts the album on a high note with her cover of the Lou Reed cut \"Perfect Day.\"  Interesting about \"Perfect Day\" is the fact that Boyle recorded an accompanying music video for the track - her first.  The production is typical of the airy, moody and atmospheric production that characterized the majority of cuts from 'I Dreamed a Dream.'  Here use of strings and piano serve as a nice, if simple backdrop for Boyle.  Vocally beautiful,  Boyle's vocals are restrained and plaintive, though by no means revolutionary or extraordinary. Nonetheless, \"Perfect Day\" is arguably the best track on The Gift.  Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" attempts the same grandeur with chilly piano, strings, and ambiance-driven background vocals, but does not achieve the same `high watermark.'  \"Hallelujah\" proves to be so slow that it comes over as lethargic;  the lethargy actually takes away from the appeal of this ubiquitous classic.  The production is so dense and lacking in clarity that it feels `mushed' together as opposed to having a sense of organization.\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" resounds the atmospheric production that characterizes Boyle's sound, which makes the listener wonder `why does every production have to sound the same?'  Nonetheless, pure vocals by Boyle smothered in reverb prove to captivate enough that \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" atones for the overly slow treatment of \"Hallelujah.\" That said, the predictability of this track is even more pronounced than usual for a Christmas track, perhaps due in part to the predictability that surrounds this traditional singer.  \"Don't Dream It's Over\" is a nice enough pop turn from Boyle, but again,  the track sounds sleepy despite a solid vocal from Boyle.  Again, this is a `pop' song interspersed between Christmas cuts, which is an odd premise in the first place.  That said, follow-up cut \"The First Noel\" is perfect (as perfect as any cut can be on this affair) with a nice change of pace including accompaniment initially by acoustic guitar and a natural feeling evolution within this cut.  \"The First Noel\" puts `some pep in the step' of the album giving it a bit more life and showing off Susan Boyle, the star that all feel in love with.\"O Holy Night\" isn't bad, though the production recalls \"Amazing Grace's\" treatment from her prior effort.  Boyle attempts to achieve magic at the end on the tried-and-true climax \"O Night Divine,\" but false vocals from the singer slightly dilutes the emotion.  Again, dense production makes \"O Holy Night\" feel a bit all-over-the-place.  \"Away in a Manger\" is predictable, opening with a choir covering the first verse and Boyle handling duties on the second verse supported by strings.  Again, `the formula' grows old here; a brief length serves as a highlight of this cut.\"Make Me a Channel of Your Piece\" is lovely, but ultimately a bore serving more as `background music' than a vital piece of The Gift.  \"Auld Lang Syne\" is pleasant while closing cut \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" feels appropriately placed and closes the album solidly, but again by no means exceptionally.Overall, 'The Gift' feels lukewarm and underwhelming.  Boyle sounds strong enough, but the strength that propelled her on British Got Talent feels absent here - or at least compromised by the murky production and predictable, unexceptional material on the album. That is hard to say sense carols and covers themselves are rather predictable, but maybe just a slight change of pace or alterations of these classics might have taken the tone and the enjoyability of 'The Gift' to the next level.\n", "val": 0.0011328760301694274}
{"text": "I bought her first CD with great anticipation and loved hearing the voice I heard on BGT. I will agree that the tempo of the songs from the first CD were all very similar, but it was her clear, clean powerful voice that came through. This CD lacks the luster the first one had. I won't go into the song selections, but rather the somewhat worrisome sound of her voice. Just from the short selections on hand, I could hear her holding back that I didn't hear in her first CD. It sounds as if her vocal cords aren't connecting to each other as smoothly as they did when I first heard her sing on BGT and her first CD. I have also picked up a slight irritation of the vocal cords within her normal speaking voice on the video she has for \"The Gift\" that I didn't notice before. The nightmare of all nightmares is for a singer to strain her vocal cords. I do hope I'm wrong, but I'm picking up something in her voice that wasn't there before.I am tempted to buy the CD just to hear each cut all the way through. Perhaps my concerns will be removed and then I can truly say the selections were just not that great. I know she can certainly do better than this. She proved that to everyone around the world when she stepped out on stage and began to sing. How nice it would be to have those goose-bumps back again. Unfortunately this CD produced nothing of the sort. May her beautiful, powerful voice once again shine through. I'll be waiting....\n", "val": 8.706496737431735e-05}
{"text": "If you're looking for a ho-ho-ho giggly, wiggly Christmas album -- this isn't it.  Susan's album is reverant and calm and extremely beautiful.  The Christmas songs were done in a manner in which they would be sung in a catheral and with a deeply spiritual feeling.  They were sung with emotion and sincerity.  The listener is taken back to a time when Christmas trees were real, you felt the \"glow\" of Christmas not of Santa Claus, and the warmth you felt wasn't from rushing about, but was from special times with family and friends.  Even the secular songs fit very nicely into the mix to enjoy before and after the holidays, or for those who don't care for Christmas carols.  Susan puts her own interpretation into both the Christmas songs and secular songs to make them unique and special.  Her voice has never sounded more spectacular.  Susan is trying to show us the true meaning of Christmas through her music, and I believe she's pulled it off in masterful fashion.  The Gift recreates the wonder and awe, I remember as a child, of stepping into church on Christmas Eve, with snow falling, choirs singing, and candles lit.No ho-ho-ho or wiggles, or giggles.\n", "val": 0.03324662894010544}

{"text": "I purchased The Gift expecting just that: a fantastic gift. However, my initial reaction to this album was stunned confusion. The first track threw me for a loop, followed by the second. Where was the Christmas music? Ah yes, track three. This album has 10 songs, only three of which are actually Christmas related--the other three are covers that feel haphazardly chosen and thrown in by record execs just for giggles. There was NO reason for the three pop covers to be on what was touted to be a *Christmas* album. I was honestly hoping that \"Hallelujah\" was actually the more Christmas related Handel's Hallelujah Chorus. It was a fantastic opportunity to showcase her voice that was completely missed.If you're looking for a Christmas album, I recommend downloading the seven Christmas songs, and leave the rest behind. As it stands, I'm debating whether or not to take the second copy of this album I bought for my mother back to the store, such is my disappointment. Also, I feel I must state my disappointment at what I can only call the \"Popification\" of Susan Boyle. She began with such a classical sounding deep and reverberating voice, and now she sings up in her nose, adding superfluous pop vocal wavers which personally detracts from her wonderful singing voice.

{"text": "I'm confused as can be re Susan Boyle's latest (Holiday)album opening with Lou Reed's \"A Perfect Day\" - and this is her first selection for a video from the album.Many believe Lou Reed's lyrics are a masterfully poignant expression of frustration, sarcasm and bitter loss associated with a lover that has abandoned him.  \"Oh what a perfect day....I'm glad I could spend it with you (the lover who is NOT there - sarcastic as can be)....You just keep me hanging on.....Your gonna reap just what you sow\".  Other's have interpreted the song to be Reed's ode to a drug habit.The video images support the loss and frustration expressed by the lyrics - Susan always appearing alone, walking down a pier to the end by herself - and atop a barren (but beautiful) rocky cliff as she begins to sing the songs ending - Your gonna reap just what you sow.  Yes, the scenery is beautiful - but the sky is purposely overcast to reflect the darkness of the lyrical content.I'm confused by Susan's expressions of happiness during the song - very inappropriate based upon the true meaning of the lyrical content.  I am further confused by the songs inclusion on what otherwise appears to be a Holiday album.

{"text": "This album is indeed a \"Gift\" from singer Susan Boyle.  It is much, much lovelier than I had anticipated, and it is amazing how new life is breathed into even the old faithful Christmas standbys.  Susan Boyle and Steve Mac definitely took a unique approach to the songs on this album and of course her voice adds a magical quality that transcends all.....\"Hallelujah, \" while not a Christmas song, slips in here surprisingly well.  It is beautifully nuanced and interpreted in a way very different from any other version I have heard.....The real knock-my-socks-off track on this album for me is the stunning \"O Holy Night.\" While I would've preferred just Susan singing it alone, the choir does enhance the overall impact.  When Susan soars with those high notes in a couple of places,  here come the goose bumps again!  The first time I heard this track, chills literally ran up-and-down my spine.  This is a beautiful rendition of a beloved and cherished Christmas song.As I had guessed I might just from hearing the sampler, I immediately loved \"Auld Lang Syne.\" Beautifully done version of a traditional song from her native country.  Susan and a piano and just a wee bit of choral accompaniment in one section....Lovely! I'm a sucker for a nice piano accompaniment.....The simplicity of the arrangement here suits this song well.I was surprised to hear a somewhat different ending on \"Don't Dream It's Over\" than what viewers heard when Susan sang this on \"Oprah.\" IMHO, more musically interesting.  Again, an unusual choice for a Christmas/holiday album but it conveys yet another thought-provoking underlying message to the listener.\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" is uniquely arranged and presented.....a little too much emphasis on the reverb/echo in the beginning of the song, which I don't care for, but aside from that, it's quite nicely done -- the two women's voices complement each other quite well. Only in one brief section do they actually sing together and harmonize. I would love to hear them perform more songs in the future!\"Make Me a Channel of Your Peace\" is lovely....it is genuinely prayerful and soulful; one really listens to the words (which usually doesn't happen when as part of a congregation, one is peering at the words in the hymnal and singing it in a Mass or church service).This album definitely has the feeling of deep spirituality and somewhat of a \"churchy\" ambience with the choral accompaniment and especially the choral endings on a couple of the songs. However, for this album, for this season of the year, yes, it's appropriate. This is a timeless album which will be played in homes throughout the world for many, many Christmas seasons to come.I do have a few nitpicks.....  IMHO the overall pacing is a bit too slow; I don't think it would've hurt to have picked up the tempo at least a little bit!The album is also too short.  Why only ten tracks?  (In Japan they will be treated to an eleventh, \"bonus\" track).  There is no reason why the producers couldn't have added in one or two more songs. Ahem..... Gounod's \"Ave Maria\" would have been the icing on this cake.....  I very much would like Susan to record that classic piece one day.After listening to \"The Gift\"  all the way through twice plus listening to a couple of the songs a few extra times, I can state with assurance that I like this album and the songs much more than I thought that I would. I am surprised at some of the interesting and different arrangements, especially on the old familiar Christmas carols that most of us have heard since our cradle days. The tenderness, the thoughtfulness and the evocativeness with which Susan interprets this music is just amazing. While there is restraint, even softness and quietness at times rather than full-out \"belting,\" I think it works well for most of the songs. In a couple of places Susan could've put a little more of her \"power voice\" into a couple of the songs, but in reality there is a lot of power, a lot of impact in that very restraint and quietness, too. Again it goes back to the interpretation, the nuances.  On \"Hallelujah\" in particular, the delicate nuances of Susan's interpretation really give this song a unique and special quality.The production values? Well, IMHO a bit over-done, at times a bit too slowly-paced. I realize that undoubtedly the idea was to set a mood of reverence, of peace, of spirituality.....but the tempo really IS a wee bit too slow.  Aside from that, it is my observation that there are places where the backings, either instrumental or choral, veer dangerously close to overshadowing the singer, and undoubtedly would have done just that to someone with lesser vocal ability.  Thankfully Susan Boyle has remarkable vocal gifts.  Her crystalline voice retains command  and gracefully informs each track.  Given the nature of this album, it is not inappropriate to have a choral presence on most of the songs, and this brings cohesiveness and unity to the album, even when some of the songs are more secular than sacred.With \"The Gift\" the listener is surrounded by beautiful sound, by ethereal voices, always led and guided by Susan's own pure, extraordinary voice and is transported, even if only briefly, from the busyness and the irritations of everyday life into another world....one offering a reminder of peace, joy, and love.November 10, 2010:  Editing this to add that if anyone has the means or opportunity to also purchase and hear the \"bonus track,\" which is available only on the version of \"The Gift\" sold in Japan, DO IT.  (Hint: check out Amazon Japan)  This is an exquisitely rendered, delicate and tender version of Yumi Arai's  \"Vapor Trail,\" translated into and sung in English.  Presented simply and elegantly with piano and cello accompanying Susan's vocals, this song is haunting.  No choirs here, no choirs needed....  The song's lyrics and Susan's voice more than gracefully convey the song's meaning....  Although again not a Christmas song, this particular piece definitely has a special place on this album.\"The Gift\" is truly a gift of love from Susan Boyle, encompassing the many elements of the holiday season, including love and loss, reflections on past, present and future,  hope and joy, peace, celebration and tradition.\n", "val": 0.0358780175447464}

The closing track, \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" is a great track suitable at this time of the year (just a few weeks away from X-mas). On overall, this is a great effort CD release by Susan Boyle, great music, great vocals & harmonies, this CD will make a really great \"Gift\" to loved ones this coming X-mas.\n", "val": 0.05480606108903885}
{"text": "This album is indeed a \"gift\" for those who love good music sung brilliantly.  There are a few secular songs offered, but this is most definitely a Christmas album.  Miss Boyle reinterprets A Perfect Day and Hallelujah and gives both an unexpected but breathtakingly haunting and ethereal quality. Don't Dream It's Over offers encouragement during the difficult times and urges one to continue to dream.  Her clear, pure voice and incredible versatility are the real stars in the Christmas tracks.  She soars to celestial heights in Oh Holy Night, sings a gentle lullaby in Away in a Manger, reverently prays Make Me a Channel of Your Peace.  The joyful expectancy of the coming of the Christchild is perfectly presented in The First Noel, Oh Come All Ye Faithful, and the moving Do You Hear What I Hear, the duet sung with Amber Stassi, winner of Susan's Search. Each track is a gem to be treasured, but my favorite is Auld Lang Syne.  A bittersweet goodbye to what is past but a hope for what is to come, it is the most outstanding rendition of this classic that I have ever heard.  I highly recommend this album to those who love this joyful season and expect it will be a Christmas classic for years to come.\n", "val": 0.05115123838186264}
{"text": "This album is excellent.  Susan's voice is like crystal and she always sings from her heart.  I found it impossible to pick a favorite on this album.  As I listen to each one, that one becomes my favorite.  I was really looking forward to Make Me A Channel Of Your Peace, and I was not disappointed.  It is just breathtaking.  I also enjoyed Away In The Manger.  The three songs that maybe are not traditional Christmas songs, Perfect Day, Hallelujah and Don't Dream It's Over, all fit nicely into the Christmas feeling that Susan carries with her.  I will be giving The Gift as Christmas gifts and I highly recommend this album.\n", "val": 0.06547317653894424}
{"text": "What can I say but 'wow'!I love Susan's 'Perfect Day'. Her rendition helps one to focus on the better things of life! Her rendition soothes the soul. Love it!'Hallelujah' made me cry because it gave a very personal message to me. The betrayal of somebody close to you indeed proves one's faith. But nevertheless, 'Hallelujah' (which actually means 'Praise the Lord!). It's amazing  how Susan can make this song an emotional experience to the listener,especially with it soft (almost a whisper) and abrupt ending.The 'Do You Hear What I Hear' duet with Amber Stassi sounds like a very beautiful invitation to hear what Susan and Amber hear, and see what they see. Helps bring the focus back to Christmas and what Christmas joy is really all about. In this song, Amber sang more times that Susan, perhaps to show-case her talent in this one song.'Don't Dream It's Over' in the CD is Susan's performance in Oprah and more. I love the repetition of the \"you know they won't win.\" Thank you, Susan! They won't! This is the best version of the song that I've heard so far.'The First Noel' is so exquisite and different from other versions I've heard before. Usually, singers at the climax would sing the 4th 'Noel' in a higher note, but Susan instead gives the focus on 'born is the King of Israel'. A unique rendition that gives this old hymn new life. I love it, Susan!'O Holy Night' gave me goosebumps, especially the part, \"Christ is the Lord, that ever, ever praise we! Noel, Noel!\" To me it sounded like Susan gave it her all on that one! Incredibly beautiful rendition, and so touching it brought the tears out!'Away in a Manger' brought back the memory of my daughter when she was 3 and sang this in front of the church (and remembered all the verses!!!!). Susan's version is different from the one they sing in the US and one that is more common here in the UK. So sweet, so peaceful... a lullaby. Most likely, Susan's mom sang it to her when she was a baby.'Make Me a Channel of Your Peace' sounds like a private prayer being sang to God, the Creator. I love the choice of the verse that brought the song to the end --- \"And where there's darkness ever joy.\" Susan's notes says: \"Lord, use me as your instrument. Let me continue to make people happy. You meant me to do this.\" Susan, your prayer is being answered! Amen!'Auld Lang Syne' - it sounded so divine to me even if I don't understand some of the words (Scottish English?). Do you hear what I hear? Susan's version being played in pubs all over the UK, and people listening to the message that Susan brings out in her version - to make resolutions for a new beginning. The slower pace Susan sings this certainly makes room for meditation.'O Come all Ye Faithful' sounded acapella to me. The build-up of the song with the choir makes this a very appropriate ending to the CD - an invitation to 'Come and join us'.Overall, a truly beautiful work of art that will go down in history as a classic work and one that will be enjoyed for decades to come. I'm so proud of you, Susan!\n", "val": 0.0376846119761467}

This song is very catchy, and this man can really sing, to be honest I'd never heard of him before this song but he's really made his mark as everyone else I know loves this song as well.

{"text": "As usual, when I write a review of a song I have the jam pumping when I do so, so that I my words are inspired by the music, and this instance is no exception.I'm an admitted fan of Cee-Lo, AKA Thomas DeCarlo Callaway, of Gnarls Barkley and Goodie Mob. I think his cover of Kung Fu Fighting for the Kung Fu Panda flick was one of the best covers ever recorded. So being a zealot of the entire Lady Killer album, (I even bought the sexy \"Girl In Red\" Lady Killer t-shirt off his site) I've got to say, with all due deference to Fook' You, that Bright Lights, Bigger City is my favorite track off his stellar current effort.Take the hard driving beat of a great Michael Jackson groove; infuse it with the majestic orchestration of a James Bond anthem; then crown it with Cee-lo's soaring distinctive voice, and you've got Bright Lights, Bigger City coming at you like a freight train of visceral energy! And Damn Skippy! You can dance to it too!And this is not just your run of the mill booty shakin' cut, brothers and sisters. No, this could be played in a ballroom at an inaugural gala, all classy tuxedoes and sparkling gowns, couples cutting tangos and pasos across the polished marble in the Capital Rotunda, and in every footfall there is international intrigue and potent pheromones in the air as power brokering titans feel the funk, and are powerless against the cosmic convergence of symphonic harmony, old school soul, and the new millennium voice of Cee-Lo Green!This song has such thrilling dynamics that when fed through a good sound system it vibrates you to the fibers of your core. It's the kind of tune that makes you want to seek adventure and romance. Not only do you want to seek them, but you can see them coming to fruition in your mind through the portal of the music.I have no idea why I don't hear this song on the radio right now. The music industry and its byzantine vagaries boggles my mind no end. I'd blast this jam loud and proud from my car window, and I do, just not from my favorite pop station. And on that note, the music video is freakin' awesome! Google it, and check it out.Cee-Lo has always been an innovator and a risk taker, just like his famed pseudonym purports him to be. He rolls the dice yet again, and when Lady Luck blows on them, it's comin' up all sevens and elevens, baby!

Some of the  best of the many ber-talented sidemen who played with Maynard--Slide Hampton, Don Sebesky, Willie Maiden, Jimmie Ford, Carmen Leggio, and Jake Hanna--deliver memorable solos, and the album soars with such classics as \"Slide's Derangement\" and the stunning \"Frame for the Blues.\" Though recorded over 50 years ago, \"Message\"  contains such consummate ensemble and solo work  that it sounds as though it could have been recorded yesterday.

{"text": "This is a wonderful early album by Maynard Ferguson.  The Newport Jazz Festival, established in 1954, quickly became the center of the Jazz \"universe,\" where the best artists performed and emerging artists could put themselves on the map.  Maynard's stint with Stan Kenton in 1950-53 made him one of the highest-regarded jazz trumpeters in the world,and it was those years that he won the Downbeat Magazine reader polls for Best Trumpeter.  Maynard left in 1953 to become the top trumpeter for Paramount Pictures and continued to record, but he left in 1956, disappointed by the lack of live performances, which were his greatest thrill.  He took the helm of the Birdland Dream Band in 1956, and it's much of this personnel and charts that we hear on \"Message from Newport,\" recorded in 1958.  The band is rock solid and Maynard is clearly out to establish himself in a quickly-shrinking jazz scene.  Sadly, it wouldn't work.  By the 1960s, jazz musicians were flocking to Europe and Japan, where they could have lucrative careers and were treated well.  Maynard would go with them ... only to be one of the few to return!To the end of his career, when pushed to name his one favorite album, Maynard would choose \"Message from Newport.\"  It's no wonder.  This was Maynard at the height of his powers, with his distinctive big band style, with an all-star band, at the twilight of American jazz before everything would change.I have only one reservation about this album--the quality of this particular transcription.  This recording could use some re-mastering and tweaking to bring it up to audiophile standards.  Still, if this is the only way to get it for now, it's absolutely worthwhile.\n", "val": 0.021112110465765}

{"text": "Lest the title and photo lead you to believe otherwise, this is not a \"live\" album.  It is, however, the quintessential Ferguson band (released in 1958), his most definitive and productive period (i.e. before his hair turned to silver, he gained 100 lbs., and went \"Chameleon\" on us) ... 13 pieces that sound like 20, musicians (a nice mix of youngsters and veterans, including Willie Maiden and Slide Hampton) who actually solo, and a leader who is an integral component of the orchestra, not just a showpiece for the stratospheric register.  I played the hell out of the vinyl version during my high school and college days, and was thrilled to see it available in MP3 format.  Unlike many albums of the era, this one is timeless... still sounds fresh and contemporary. It's Maynard Ferguson unplugged (or rather pre-plugged; the last thing he needed was to be amplified) ... the little big band that could.  Get it ... you'll love it!\n", "val": 0.019988739863038063}

{"text": "At the time of this review there are only two other reviews of this album and they both are very negative of this collection.  Also, the price on this collection is only $0.99, which is the price I bought it for.  $0.99 for 99 songs?!?!  Seriously, that is an amazing value.To be honest I had no idea there was Thanksgiving music and really this might just be an excuse by the music label to throw together a lot of light fare classical tunes from their catalog to generate a product to capitalize on holiday shoppers.  Well, thank goodness for capitalism as this is a great compilation.The performances are solid as are the recordings.  I'm not really sure why the other reviewers where so harsh.  If you want the really good performances of classical music, those recordings will always sell at a premium.  For the purpose this collection serves - which is to provide appropriate background music to a family Thanksgiving feast - I can't imagine the need to look elsewhere.  That being said, it's not Thanksgiving as I write this and yet I'm enjoying listening to this collection now. My iTunes tells me I have 6.5 days worth of just Classical music in my collection, a collection that started 25 years ago.  Yet surprising, there is a lot of material featured here I don't previously have or have listened to before.The typical compliant that \"best of\" or budget compilations have also exists here - full works are not provided, just certain movements. However, 99% of your dinner guests will never notice this.This collection makes a great classical music sampler in general, despite the \"Thanksgiving\" billing.  Since it is lighter fare, it makes great reading music or the perfect entry point for those new to classical music.  Or it's just a great way to afford-ably round out an already healthy collection.The composers featured are the typical top composers as well as lesser known ones.  A quick rundown of the composers are:- Schubert- Mozart- Beethoven- Tchaikovsky- Vavaldi- Pachelbel- Handel- Bach- Boccherini- Dvorak- Svendsen- Mendelssohn- Verdi- Giordani- Brahms- Chopin- Debussy- Liszt- Bizet- Delibes- Rubinstein- Haydn- Telemann- Massenet- Berlioz- Grieg- Rimsky-Korsakov- Weber- Quantz- Downland- Buffardin- Gomez- OffenbachIf this collection is still being offered at $0.99, don't hesitate to buy it, regardless of the time of year.\n", "val": 0.006717691197991371}

A couple of cancer patients have found this cd to minister to them as well.  I look foward to the upcoming Tyler Perry movie in which Wess Morgan will have a part.  I will tell everyone to look out for him.  May God continue to richly bless all that Wess Morgan does and will do in the future.  I know through his music he will touch many lives.  Also you must visit his website and read his testimony......oh my!!!!  what an awesome story of what God can do and how your life can turn around.

{"text": "One of Gospel music's most promising personalities returned to the spotlight with his highly anticipated sophomore project, UNDER AN OPEN HEAVEN.  Tennessee-native Wess Morgan possesses not only one of the most engaging voices in the genre but has also emerged as a triple-threat (Pastor, Producer, Praise Worshiper) that can minister in any arena, to any audience.Unlike his debut album, LOOK AT ME NOW, Wess Morgan forgoes the production studio on UNDER AN OPEN HEAVEN for the live stage, along with his church chorale, The Celebration Of Life Choir, and the result is breathtaking. The opening track, O Great One, showcases Morgan's proficiency as both a capable songwriter and powerful pastor of Paise & Worship.  The momentum never lets up on I Will Sing Of Your Great Love, another Sunday service praise offering.The tempo is restrained on the sacred ballad, I Choose To Worship, a song aimed at ushering in the presence of God.  However, Wess Morgan is likely at his best on that Gaither's classic made popular by Andrae Crouch, Something About That Name. Wess Morgan shows his calling to ministry, as he sings in such a soul-shattering way. A meditation is prolonged with additional selections like Welcome Into This Place featuring Aaron Crabb and More Of You.  The praise service never lets up, as Wess Morgan captures the essence of worship and praise in the sanctuary on the Praise Medley.Morgan manages to combine the spirit of God with a twist of salsa on his next number, Sing Unto The Lord. And the title track, Under An Open Heaven, is Wess Morgan in full bloom, bringing energy, artistry and ministry to a single song, which points upward and onward from any perspective.Perhaps the biggest surprise and best kept secret on the album arrives only at the end on the bonus track, You Gave Me Hope, a throwback, soulfully slick song that confirms Wess Morgan is the real deal. As far as albums are concerned, Under An Open Heaven is a keeper for the avid Gospel fan and a blessing to that listener seeking an inspirational experience through song.\n", "val": 0.020466919988393784}
{"text": "I just purchased the video -- an excellent present to someone who is in need of God's presence and to those who want to have a praise and worship experience. Wess not only demonstrates his gift of song/ministry--but allows other lead singers (that you really need to hear)to demonstrate their gospel-filled voices and instruments.  There's a message for everyone---old, young and in between.  \"Jesus, We Celebrate You!\" is one that even the \"children's choirs\" can learn in just a matter of minutes!!!

{"text": "Jesper Kyd's scores for the Assassin's Creed franchise have always been a stellar and mesmerizing experience. The second one really blew me away with the way and had some amazing modern approaches to a culturally influenced soundscape. The second score built off of what he composed for the first game and really pulled everything together for a very special and distinct voice. You were thrown into a world of mystery and intrigue and it had such an amazing progressive quality to it. This time around don't expect the same.Brotherhood is a game that is more focused on the open world multiplayer than it is on a story. The music reflects that in a way. Where Kyd's previous score found the perfect balance of cultural sounds and modern techniques here things get a bit out of hand. The propulsive percussions can become headache inducing at times and the constant action cues just sort of blended together. The unique flavor of the score quickly disappeared.As the score went along tracks didn't really progress a story nor did emotions come through. The music here is borderline trailer music as the major intention is to make things sound exciting. Don't get me wrong, in the right situations that kind of music works. I absolutely loved the track \"The Brotherhood Escapes\", but can you honestly say that's not trailer music? As the score trucks along the experience can get a bit redundant and by the end you don't feel like much was accomplished. The score has elements of what made the first 2 scores so great, but much of that is lost in trying to make this a super exciting action score meant to play in the background. Hopefully things get back on track for Assassin's Creed 3.From my site: Film, Music & Media\n", "val": 0.000153745713760145}

City of Rome is a very calm and ancient feeling song and is tipically played when Ezio is walzing through the streets.  The Brotherhood Escapes is very upbeat and fast and is tipically played while fighting or running away.  Countdown has a clock ticking during it so it makes you feel rushed.

He's more of a veteran in the rap game, being around for over 8 years and he has a lot of experience under his belt.  Being a part of 2 mainstream/major label G-Unit albums, but mostly the dozens of solo & G-Unit mixtapes that have been put out, and what made him (and the rest of G-Unit) well known and famous.  Much more mainstream than when he first came on the scene, and it shows the most on the major label albums, this one not excluded.  He still has some harder, more gangsta songs; but more and more radio friendly and songs for the ladies/teens (much like Fabolous).  As far as comparison to his other solo's, I'd say they are all pretty close to one another, but this is probably my least favorite (his debut \"The Hunger for More\" and \"Rotten Apple\" I'd say are just slightly better and more consistant albums).  This one has 13 songs, 4 are ok, 1 is borderline skippable, and the other 8 are good, but no classic or even near classic song.  Guests are heavy as well, on 11 songs (rapping on 6 and doing the hook on 5).  Production is hit or miss basically throughout the album, and not too many are ones I've heard of before.  Cardiak does 3 songs, Frank Dukes, Justice League, Ryan Leslie, Grind Muzik & Bliz Money, Nick Speed, Prime, G Sparkz, Dirk Date, The Watcherz, Dready all do 1 song.

The Game whether people like it or not, tore apart G-Unit with his constant barage of attacks against them. Lloyd Banks aka Oscar The Grouch (The Game's nickname for him) comes back at the right time and delivers a great album. \"Home Sweet Home\" is my favorite as he trades verses with maybe the best mc of 2010, Pusha T. \"Take 'Em To War\" with Talk Of New York Yayo is a great song for the Unit. \"Kill It\" with Governor, at the end of the album is the type of beat that Lloyd Banks always shines on.

{"text": "This time last year there was a lot of chatter about a Lloyd Banks comeback album.  I admit after the disaster that was Rotten Apple I wasn't too optimistic for him.  He had a series of underground mixtapes that only his die hard loyal fans enjoyed because it was filled with the punchline rap that dominated the early part of the decade and less than stellar production.  Nonetheless, Lloyd Banks decided to reinvent himself and come out hard.  After label switches and feuding with Rick Ross he released Beamer Benz or Bentley, a highly successful single that really put Lloyd Banks back in the minds of the mainstream.Lloyd Banks began making his runs with guest appearances, interviews and singles that increased anticipation for the album.  His Blue Friday series was very successful in which he released a new song (none included on the album) every Friday (or so). Given the quality of the songs, I began anticipating the album.  The Hunger For More 2 has finally come out on a crowded day that also featured Kanye West, Nicki Minaj & Ne-Yo.  Needless to say his release was overlooked not because it's wack but because that's just how it is.The Hunger For More 2 delivers on the production side of things as well as Lloyd Banks lyrics.  He has almost completely let go of the punchline filled rap to a more mature reality type rap and I must say it suits him a lot better.  With a naturally muffled voice, he never really could deliver his punchlines with authority.  But with his laid back style a more reflective and real style helps him shine through.  The beats are a lot harder this time around as well and will get the Rotten Apple taste out of your mouth.  Guests include Kanye West, Fabolous, Ryan Leslie, Styles P, 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, Lloyd, Jeremih, Raekwon, Akon, Pusha T, & Juelz Santana.  That's plenty of features for a 13 track album but the guests never feel tacked on and work within the concept of the song. The songs I'm feeling the most are I Don't Deserve You ft. the underated Jeremih, Any Girl with Lloyd, Start It Up, and Home Sweet Home.  Less than stellar songs include On The Double and Celebrity.Fans of Lloyd Banks should definitely check this one out as well as fans of hardcore hip hop albums.  Hunger For More 2 is a very worthy release and a welcome return for Lloyd Banks. 4 Stars. Recommended.*The 5 Bonus tracks are Feel Like You ft. Eminem, Where I'm At ft. Eminem, Stuntin, This Is The Life, and Kill It ft. Governor.

I know a lot of fans rave on about Nikki & Kanye albums but HFM 2 is like a pure Hip-Hop and album with plenty of raw beats and punchlines to go with it as well. Even though, the GUnit label isn't in it's prime anymore Banks still shows he has that Hunger and desire in his music.If it's anything that holds this album back from being just as good as the first is too many guest appearances(even though the features aren't bad)and Banks got a little too carried away with the R&B joints. Other then that, this album can get plenty of replay in my CD player.My favorite tracks: Unexplainable, Payback, Home Sweet Home, Father Time, Start It Up, & Celebrity.\n", "val": 0.013438105583190918}

{"text": "So I'm never too quick to buy into \"sequel albums\" because they seldom capture the passion of their originals, but I had to give Banks a shot 'cause he is first and foremost my favorite lyricist, and after the fiasco with \"The Big Withdrawal\" that turned into a premature \"Rotten Apple,\" it's only fair that we assume that his sophomore effort, a solid three star concept album, was only a fluke in what should be a long and successful career (he is the only one in G-Unit now who deserves such a career)I was pleasantly surprised to see that sir Lloyd Banks really does reiterate the feel that we got back on the 2004 classic. He brings the four, five, even six syllable rhymes back that we missed sorely on Rotten Apple, the versatile beats that make each track an experience and give them all a different vibe while managing to be an overall positive, feel good album. The same topics are touched upon here as the first CD, namely, money, power, girls, respect, etc, etc, and like on the first CD Banks tackles each track with energy and charisma. He positively rips through his verses on nearly every song, something that was hit or miss on his last effort, and proves step by step that he is ready once again to give his all.There are a few things that make this CD distinctly different than his 2004 debut. We see Banks trading some of his trademark punchlines in, there aren't even a fraction of as many as we see back on HFM, for a more smooth sounding flow that carries a verse from start to finish, but this is hardly a complaint. Also, lots and lots of guest appearances, some of which are a nice fit (Styles P on Unexplainable, Pusha T on Home Sweet Home) but others can sometimes really take away from the tracks. 50 does his best to ruin Payback, but thankfully he is only present on the hook, a forgivable sin, and \"Start it Up\" opens with a killer Banks verse but after that he gives it up to about three or four other artists who don't nearly pack the fire he does (C'mon, Kanye West? Get that outta here, would ya?)In the end though it's hard to deny that our man Lloyd went all out here and left it all in the booth. Cuts like \"Take 'em to War\" and \"Father Time\" might make you forget what year it is and put you right back in 2004 when G-Unit was still in it's prime (Thankfully he doesn't push the G-Unit bill nearly as much as before, a possible acknowledgment of its fading glory which he alone seems to be the exception to) The only song that really doesn't fit the bill for a sequel to Hunger for More would be the single that we've all heard by now \"Beamer, Benz, or Bentley\" With a hollow, eerie sounding beat, bass that makes my speakers crackle, and bars that are traded off and on with Juelz Santana, it is truly an entity all of its own, which is not a bad thing at all.

{"text": "6 years later.... and we are presented with a sequel to the cult classic original 'Hunger For More'My first impressions upon listening to the whole album for the first time was 'Wow, Banks went all out in this one ' however, my upon my second time listening to it thoroughly and analytically, i felt that the album could have been much better with 2 songs that did not fit in with album.The first song that did not fit with this album was called 'On The Double' This song is just horrible in just so many ways. It just doesn't fit Lloyd's style at all. This song is what you call a bland mainstream unthoughtful expedited hasty failure. How in God's name did this song ever find its way to this album is just beyond me. I don't even know what Banks' was thinking when he rehearsed this song, but again, to each of his own. My standards in Hip-Hop are tipped to favor the songs that has passion, charisma, flow with raw, but never enticing vocals. This song has none of what i have mentioned.Finally, the second song that I particularly didn't like either was 'Sooner or Later ft Raekwon'Again, this song had some nice verses and great rips from Banks--and there was definitely some of that Tupac & Biggie vibe going on in there, but for a highly anticipated album, this song didn't really do nothing for me. It's already 2010, the whole soft touching, blue clues, Indies 80's type jazzy feel with the church quier gals singing whenever they feel like it is such a disappointment. This was suppose to be a Hip-Hop album, not an 1988 Whitney Houston track mixed in with average rapping(no idea why Banks didn't save his best for last) from Lloyd and Raekwon. Basically, the song wasn't that bad, it was just meh, it didn't really grab me or anything, but who's to say it's not the same for you?You wanna know how this album could have been a success? Remember those 2 songs that Banks made just before H.F.M.2 came out? Those songs from Blue Friday?Replace song #10(On The Double) with the song 'Everything You Got'Replace song #13(The last song) with the song 'Goodbye'give it that, and you have the best hip-hop album of 2010. Other than that, it gets a 3.5 from my end.\n", "val": 4.2392435716465116e-05}

{"text": "With the exception of Herbie Hancock and Eliane Elias on \"I'll Be Home For Christmas\", I found the instrumentals here rather disappointing and unexciting, even for smooth jazz.  Especially disappointing to me was Dave Koz' \"Winter Wonderland\".  He has a very short version of the song on his album: \"Dave Koz & Friends: A Smooth Jazz Christmas\".  On that album, the brief taste of the song as part of \"Overture\" has a life of its own.  That's missing here.  Of course, the personell except for Bill Sharpe on bass is different, and that makes the difference.  Dave just doesn't play as well with the group of this CD as he does with the group on his own.However, the Herbie Hancock cut comes out strong, and then there are the marvelous ladies here.  I'll go with the crowd in lauding Dianne Reeves & Lou Rawls \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\".  This is a tremendous rendition.  But Diana Krall's soulful \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\" comes across as a strong number also.  Cassandra Wilson has fun with \"Little Drummer Boy\" and Cyro Baptista's percussion shouldn't be slighted.  And Anita Baker carries \"The Christmas Song\" quite well.If you enjoy the female vocalists as I do, you'll like this, but for a really good smooth jazz Christmas set, give Dave Koz & Friends a try.\n", "val": 0.0022435213904827833}

Like some of the previous reviewers said, it is a great album for people new to the Jazz scene, but it also a great album for Jazz loves. It is loaded with a  taste of some of Jazz's current outstanding artists. Dianne Reeves &  Lou Rawls does my favorite rendition of the jazz standard \"Baby, It's  Cold Outside\" (though Ella's version is a very close second). Although  customarily played at Christmas Time, this playful song can be appreciated  anytime of year.  If you have not before heard Holly Cole (\"Christmas  Blues\") sing, you are indeed in for a real treat, and will likely seek  out one of the Holly Cole Trio's albums with haste. (I can highly recommend  \"Don't Smoke in Bed\").  She is a most captivating and musical  singer.  Cassandra Wilson (a major name in the Jazz scene) does a wonderful  rendition of \"The Little Drummer Boy.\"  I could most definitely  go on and on, but sufficed to say this IS a wonderful album.

{"text": "~ This Christmas jazz album has a larger number of vocal tracks than the typical Christmas jazz compilation. So the best place to start a review is with the vocals.- Lou Rawls and Dianne Reeves deliver the definitive version of \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" with wonderful interaction, timing, and phrasing. Two Canadians make excellent contributions, with Holly Cole's personalized interpretation of \"The Christmas Blues\" being more distinctive than Diana Krall's rather routine version of the oft recorded \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\". Cassandra Wilson's unique percussive treatment of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" is outstanding. Anita Baker's live version of \"The Christmas Song\" is good but does not stand out among the plethora of recordings of this chestnut. Dr. John's \"Il Est N, Le Divin Enfant\" does a nice job of taking the listener to New Orleans for Christmas, while Michael Franks version of \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\" is rather sedated and is not going to inspire anyone to go out and play in the snow.~ Of the instrumental tracks, high points include a Herbie Hancock - Eliane Elias piano duet on \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" that shows considerable chemistry between these artists, a solo Chick Corea on a tender version of \"What Child Is This?\", and the Brecker Brothers funky \"The Christmas Waltz\" with occasional Spanish lyrics. Other performances by Herb Alpert with Jeff Lorber, Fourplay featuring Lee Ritenour, Steps Ahead, Stanley Clarke / George Duke / Everette Harp, John McLaughlin, and Dave Koz round out the CD with enjoyable contributions.~ Overall, the CD is not a classic, but it does provide a reasonable variety of performances by big named artists and groups. The performances are rewarding and enjoyable without ever relying on the over-produced silky string backing that tend dominate so many seasonal recordings. I give this collection a 4-star 'above average' rating.\n", "val": 0.029240749776363373}
{"text": "I was given this CD when it was first released back in the mid 90s (not 2010 like the description states, though maybe that is for this particular production and not the initial album release) and it quickly became a regular in my Christmas music collection.While I am not a \"jazz purist\",  nor claim to be a \"purist\" in much of anything, I greatly enjoy Christmas music.  Whether the crooning of Bing Crosby or the kitsch of Johnny Mathis (also a great voice!) I prefer my songs to sound traditional - more or less.  In that sense, I also enjoy the \"classical\" songs of Europe, whether the orchestration of The Nutcracker Waltz, or medieval tunes as found on the outstanding album \"Noel Celtique\"http://www.amazon.com/Noels-Celtiques-Celtic-Christmas-Brittany/dp/B000009QA1/ref=sr_1_4?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1353797074&sr=1-4&keywords=chorale+du+monde or anything else I don't understand but obviously conveys the feeling and warmth of \"Christmas\".I think that's why I love this album so much:  it's not Mariah Carey or Justin Beaver or Hip-Hop Holidaze or some other nonsense trying to \"create\" new music.  It's a jazz rendition of classics we all recognize.  It feels festive (guess I disagree with another reviewer on that) and is a nice change from the repetitive versions we hear every season (or . . . July, if you're me).And yes, Lou Rawls and Dianne Reeves do such a good job on \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" that when I hear the Dean Martin/Dina Shore (?) version I think it's wrong.  :)Buy.  Enjoy.

For me, the High point is Mahavishnu John McLaughlin's rendition of \"Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel. The arrangement by keyboardist, Jim Beard is a work of perfection and pure beauty. Mr. McLaughlin's guitar floats above the arrangement and transcends the holiday spirit.Herb Alpert has never sounded so nice.

If this one doesn't get your head and shoulders bouncing, you must be deaf.From there, the Christmas cheer just keeps on coming. Diane Reeves and Lou Rawls are just having too much fun performing Baby, It's Cold Outside; Fourplay's unmistakable smooth sound shines on It Came Upon a Midnight Clear; Diana Krall proves why she's the Official Ice Princess of Jazz on her nonetheless engaging rendition of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas; Stanley Clarke, George Duke and Everette Harp perform a surprisingly subdued yet effective O Tannenbaum (a tad bit too long, perhaps, but it's still cool); Michael Franks sings an equally melancholy Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!; and The Brecker Brothers and Steve Khan team up for a marvelously Latin-tinged version of The Christmas Waltz (It's a shame that this and Michael Franks' number weren't allowed to overlap as they would fit perfectly together).Of course, very few CDs are perfect, and the dog of the set is easily Cassandra Wilson's hideous take on The Little Drummer Boy. Why she deemed it necessary to turn it into an dirge, I'll never understand.But from there, we go right back on track. Herbie Hancock and Eliane Elias' I'll Be Home For Christmas is a wonderful piano duet; John McLaughlin's acoustic guitar shines on a straightforward version of O Come, O Come, Emmanuel; Holly Cole remakes the sadly overlooked Dean Martin number, Christmas Blues; Steps Ahead do a marvelous turn on Angels We Have Heard on High; Anita Baker's stunning The Christmas Song recalls the classic Christmas albums of the past with a gorgeous orchestra arrangement and her always heart melting vocals; and Chick Corea does a fine solo rendition of What Child is This.It's kind of strange to have two versions of the same song on the same CD, but Dave Koz gives us a second rendering of Winter Wonderland that easily pales beside its predecessor. Lastly, Dr. John tries to equal Cassandra Wilson in the ugly department with Il est Ne, Le Devin Enfant.Still, the good easily outweighs the bad and Jazz To the World remains one of the better Christmas jazz collections to be found.\n", "val": 0.014800268225371838}

{"text": "Halestorm release of their live in Philly 2010 was an amazing show with great engery, passion, desire that they show how much the music means to them while the fans show Lizzy and the band how much their music means to them.  I'll start with their CD performance very good vocals by miss Lizzy Halestorm followed by having the fans sing along with her to the songs.  As the concert continues onward Lizzy tells the people of Philly its good to be home and they got their start in Philly, only drawback though you can tell it's a live concert on two songs Love/Hate Heartbreak and Nothing to do with Love.  Postive though Lizzy shows their fans that she can do both hard rock songs plus the softer songs between the hard rock songs, one of my favorite songs though by them from the first album was the famililar taste of posion.  Then as concert keeps going we see how much RJ Lizzy's brother has so much passion for playing the drums,  to me Lizzy has the most haunting vocals ever for a singer and proves it over and over again on mutiple songs.  So out of 12 songs on the CD only 2 had feedback.  As for the DVD amazing show and you can see how much rock music means to Lizzy and the rest of the band as they rock out in front of their fans,  added bonus when you buy this CD/DVD combo you get 4 music videos to watch along with the concert.  In closing only took one star off because of those two songs with feedback and on the DVD seem to have two edited parts, what I mean is they had an extra song on the DVD that wasn't on the CD and second when she talks about coming home to Philly and the bands touring with them you don't hear her say they got their start here in Philly on the DVD.  But I enjoyed both the CD and DVD lots and I am sure if you buy this CD/DVD combo you will enjoy it as much as I did by just taking a chance on a live concert of a band I am sure you love listening to as much as I do.\n", "val": 0.010067843832075596}

This album captures their talent.  I love a band that can do it live as well as on record.  I would prefer Arjay tone it back a bit.  Okay, you're a GREAT drummer.  Roger.  Got it.  It's not all about you. You're in a BAND.  There are OTHER people on stage, too.  Still, they put on a great show.  Lzzy is great at audience interaction.  I like how she steps back into the shadows and lets Joe take the spotlight during his solos.  She has a rip-roaring voice.  I hope she can keep it up.

They play a perfect blend of pop-metal, with a couple slower tracks that aren't radio-friendly crap, even an acoustic set complete with stool on stage for the guitarist.But what makes this band - and CD/DVD - truly special is the singer's voice - the best female vocalist in the business, bar none - and her brother, a truly insane drummer who does a drum solo that's actually work watching. Even more impressive is the singer's efforts on acoustic tracks on YouTube (especially the Download Festival 2012)The only disappointment is that contains only all the tracks from the Halestorm 1st album, and nothing else. Nothing from the 2nd almbum and no covers.\n", "val": 0.008229972794651985}

Though I've seen far worse editing (e.g. when Steve Harris is allowed to edit for Iron Maiden).Lzzy's vocals are powerful & show true enthusiasm. Her love of playing in front of an eager crowd is quite evident.I like her even more after seeing an interview with her on YouTube recently where one finds she's really very down to earth.  I don't often given out 5 stars, feeling that tossing them around too much devalues them.  But this reaches a level that truly deserves all five.\n", "val": 0.015241301618516445}

I got this CD/DVD because I enjoyed seeing them live and I was not disapointed with this purchase.  Lzzy has such a powerful voice that sounds just as great live as it does on a mixed and perfected CD. She has such energy and she takes the time to interact with the fans.  One of my favorite parts of the DVD was Boom City.  AreJay is a great drummer and during that song he gets to shine.  Another high point is the song Familiar Taste of Poison. The light guitar intro gives Lzzy a chance to show off her haunting and beautiful voice.  The DVD also includes photos and videos for the singles.  If you are a fan of Halestorm, I say get this.

What a talent!\"'20th Century Guitar' said -- \"Kal David is an almost unparalled guitarist in the Blues and Rhythm and Blues field\"This CD will have you smiling from the beginning to its end.

Kal David is one of those rare players whose tone and attack succeeds in stopping the guitarist in you cold! And his voice and lyrics are equally matched!\n", "val": 0.03469038009643555}
{"text": "Deutsche Grammophon has seen fit to present these 7 final albums by the Grand Master of the keyboard for our consideration in this welcomed set.For the initiated, isn't it amazing how many later or last recordings by so many great musicians seem to be considered their most reflective and so much more deeply introspective than their other recordings. One wonders, really, if this is really so or if we just perceive this because they are \"the last ones\" perhaps.The man was a blazing fireball for much of his career and he was criticized for his \"extreme\" dynamics, from \"heavy\" double fortissimos to \"inaudible\" pianissimos. Oscar Levant stated that his octaves were \" brilliant, accurate, and etched out like bullets\" and there certainly was nobody who was not positively taken with his beauty of tone-color that was not like anyone else's.He withdrew from performance in the early-mid 80's when medications, etc, were effecting his playing, and his return in '86 was a welcomed and unexpected surprise to many. His Russian tour in 1986 placed him firmly back into the public's eye and heart and these recordings are the ones from this return period, all of them simply fabulous, and fitting as a memoriam of this \"grand little man with the red bow tie\" as I always thought of him.I had intended to single out some pieces here, but now that I am at that point I find myself reluctant to leave out even one single work or fragment from these recordings. Whether it's because they are \"the last ones\" or if it is for the different nature of his playing, I am not sure. However, trust me that this box is a true \"must have\" for any lover of the piano, and especially so for Horowitz fans. You do yourself a great injustice not to have these magnificent recordings at your elbow to enjoy again and again.The sound here is particularly impressive, and that is indeed fortunate for these historic last recordings. If I could have asked for one thing more to have been on one of them, it would, of course, have been his \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" as played in so many of his \"electrifing\" encores at his performances. Was there ever so much energy in a hall than when this guy \"finished up\" a performance? I think not!Oh, and one other really nice thing is the cover of this wonderful set...the red bow tie! It truly makes one eager to open it up and be transported by the last thoughts on these pieces by this greatest of pianists from our time.Enjoy!~operabruin\n", "val": 0.014294560998678207}

This set includes all the recordings of Horowitz published by Deutche Grammophon - late period recordings consisting mostly of lighter music such as Mozart, Chopin, and Scarlatti, often in live concert.  The technical quality of the recordings is excellent, as by the time these recordings were made, digital recording technology had come into its own.Note that for the majority of Horowitz's career, he was recording for publishers other than Deutche Grammophon.

{"text": "The Vladimir Horowitz who emerged from retirement in 1985 was a very different pianist and musician than the one who had disappeared in 1983. Long gone were the leonine fortissimos and hysteria of the 1940s; also purged was the eccentricity that became a dominating factor in the 1970s. Horowitz had replaced these with a new balance and simplicity.  He was never a puritan thank goodness, but \"controlled freedom\" (as Harold Schonberg phrased it) became the hallmark of the playing of Horowitz's last few years.The highlights of this set are too numerous to list in toto, but a few standouts are 1985's Kreisleriana, much of the Moscow recital, Mozart's Sonatas K. 281 and 333, and the Schubert-Liszt works - especially Standchen, which may well be Horowitz's best post-1980 recording.  Other recordings fall into a middle ground: Mozart's K. 330 Sonata (the live 1986 slightly preferable to the dryish 1985 version), and the K. 488 Concerto with Giulini (demoted from a top recommendation due to the non-descript, tonally un-alluring orchestra).  Schubert's D. 960 Sonata, rejected by Horowitz and issued posthumously, is a fussy, contrived performance that should have remained in the vault as the pianist wished.Unavoidably, in view of the varying locations, the quality of recorded sound varies: from the constricted, dry sonority of The Last Romantic to the atmospheric quality of the 1985 Studio Recordings.  Most occupy a middle ground - clearly focused, but far from the \"microphone in the piano\" sound of RCA's late 1970s recordings.This set comes with reproductions of the original front and back covers (DG uses the LP version if the album was originally issued on LP [the first three DG albums were deluxe gatefold presentations, which are not reproduced], otherwise the CD version) and perceptive notes by Jed Distler.  Also, unlike DG's earlier Horowitz box, this includes the 1987 Hamburg recital (Horowitz's last) along with a few more posthumously released items.  On the whole, a great set, if you can get past the tacky cover photo.\n", "val": 0.0005893434281460941}

Also this is the download you want to get if you want this song.  This remaster sounds great.  It is sharp, loud, and clear.  You hear both the music and words without any cut out or fade out.

{"text": "Growing up through the 70s, 80s, and even early 90s; Billy Joel was my favorite performer. A fantastic songwriter, piano player, live performer -- he certainly was one of the BEST musicians on the planet. If you're not familiar with his work and want to listen to his radio-friendly hits, this CD will certainly fit the bill. But for those of us who have admired Billy all these years, the CD is a disappointment. Between live albums that already have these cuts, plus the Essential package and Greatest Hits (Vols. 1 & 2, plus 3) -- how many times can we revisit the same material? Come on, Billy -- how about writing some NEW material and showcasing your talent once again? While people like Springsteen, Elton John, and Jackson Browne are coming out with new material, you've done nothing to cement your legacy. Hits? Yeah - but a better title might be \"Re-hash\".\n", "val": 1.9586059352150187e-05}

{"text": "In prelude to a thorough reissue of his album catalog, Billy Joel is celebrated on this first-ever career-spanning domestic single disc anthology. Joel's catalog has been excerpted more fully on the three-disc Greatest Hits series&nbsp;&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/2/dp/B000002BBP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2</a>] and multidisc sets&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Essential/dp/B00005OSX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Essential</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Complete-Hits/dp/B00005NNM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Complete Hits</a>, but this is the first time his lengthy catalog has been condensed to a single U.S. CD. The nineteen tracks provide a compact tour through twenty-three years of music-making, selecting recordings from every Joel album from 1971's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cold-Spring-Harbor/dp/B0012GMX6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cold Spring Harbor</a>&nbsp;through 1993's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/River-of-Dreams/dp/B0012GMWF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">River of Dreams</a>. The selections mostly follow his hit-making, though the inclusion of the non-single \"Everybody Loves You Now\" and the non-charting \"New York State of Mind\" helps flesh out the hit-maker's further identity as an album artist. This isn't a complete recitation of even Joel's biggest hits - \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Uptown Girl\" are missing, the latter perhaps a victim of divorce - but it's a musically satisfying 80-minute tour through a rich catalog of hit singles and multiplatinum albums. Radio and concert favorites like \"Piano Man,\" \"Only the Good Die Young,\" \"Big Shot,\" \"You May Be Right,\" \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" and \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" will give Joel's fans a charge and provide a great introduction to those who didn't live through his hit-making years. Joel's fascination with `60s doo-wop is heard in \"The Longest Time\" and his affection for Brill Building pop is lovingly evoked by the Ronettes-styled \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood.\" This is a good buy at a great price for those new to Joel's catalog, especially if you're not ready to pay for a multi-disc set. This collection fills a niche for newcomers; fans will have to wait for the album reissues to get their hands on rarities and previously unreleased tracks. 4-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

It is one of the greatest selling CD's of all time. And I see a couple of songs not on that compilation that are here.The only reason I see to release this compilation is fulfilling an album contract with the record company.But.....if you don't own any Billy Joel CD's at all and want to see why he's the greatest songwriter/musician of all time this CD would give you a good start.

{"text": "Billy Joel is a true artist. Even though this greatest hits collection doesn't chronicle his entire career, this album is still a solid way to be introduced to his brilliant music. There's 19 tracks here and not one rotten apple in the bunch. Billy oozes talent and these songs are evident of it. The way he sings, the way he composes, the way he arranges these timeless tracks is impeccable. You get a little bit of everything here with songs like \"Only Good Die Young\", \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\", and \"You May Be Right\" which were big hits earlier in his career. You get some of his later hits like \"The Longest Time\", \"Tell Her About It\". \"We Didn't Start the Fire\", and \"The River of Dreams\". The reason I purchased this album was to get my grubby little hands on \"Pressure\". That song is genius! Like I said, EVERY TRACK is well written and well-sung. I highly recommend it.

{"text": "Like all famous musical artists that are household names, there are a number of \"Best Of\" or \"Greatest Hits\" compilations out there. Sometimes to get all the songs you want, you will have to buy more than one of them or there might be one great collection of hits that will satisfy your taste for his/her music. \"Billy Joel: The Hits\" is one of the former. What's on this CD is great. There's \"Piano Man\". There's \"My Life\". There's \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me,\" There's \"For the Longest Time\" and the somewhat controversial but great \"Only the Good Die Young\". While there's some of his hugest hits on this compilation, real Joel fans will want more than a mere 19 tracks. Thus, this is more of a decent sampler.For a more complete overview of Billy's best work, there's a couple different paths you can take. You can buy Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Volumes 1,2 and 3 or The Essential Billy Joel 3.0. Many greatest hits collections are give and take, and it is no different here. The Greatest Hits trilogy includes hits like \"The Stranger\", \"You're Only Human\" and \"Keeping the Faith\" (exclusively) while TE 3.0 exclusively contains \"Prelude (Angry Young Man),\" \"All For Leyna\" and \"Worse Comes to Worst\". Personally I think that \"The Stranger\" would have been a much better choice to the arguably dull and forgettable third mentioned song. I would also recommend the collection \"Songs in the Attic\" which contains some gems not included in any greatest hits collection.Other winners would include the songs \"That's Not Her Style,\" unique for its hard rock sound and \"Sleeping with the Television On\", the latter being an overlooked obscurity found on the \"Glass Houses\" album, one of Joel's very best that I would also recommend and own myself. When all is said and done, you can always buy your favorite songs by themselves or listen to them on YouTube although the albums I've mentioned are all worth owning in their entirety via MP3s or discs.\"Billy Joel: The Hits\" gets 4/5 stars for being a good collection for somebody new to this genius's great work. After listening to these 19 tracks however, they will probably want more.\n", "val": 0.003898174501955509}

{"text": "This is a great collection for the casual Billy Joel fan, which I am.I was introduced to Billy Joel back in the late 1970s and I have had some of BJ's music in my collections on and off for the past 30+ years.  Of course no compilation from a catalog as large as BJ's will meet everyone's personal preferences, but this is a great cross-section and contains many of his best tracks. With that being said, any serious BJ fan will already have the majority if not all of these tracks, so this selection wasn't made for them.  It was made for people like me, casual fans who like to sing along when songs from the old days come on the radio, but who have not yet added any of his tracks to our digital collections.As I scanned down this list of tracks I saw at least 14 tracks that I'm excited to add to my playlists, and maybe the other 5 tracks will grown on me, you never know.  Anyway, 14/19 is outstanding for any greatest hits album.  And since I snagged this during one of Amazon's $5 album sales that's a real bargain!  Thanks Amazon!Well, whenever someone looks at a \"Hits\" album like this they say, why isn't _______ on it!?  I decided that what's on it's on it, and since it's got lots of what I like then, click, I bought it!  Personally I would have loved to see \"Honesty\" on it too, but sometimes life's like that.Anyway, I'm excited to add these tracks to my list of MP3 titles and smile when they come up.\n", "val": 0.022265395149588585}

I'd trade \"Only The Good Die Young\", \"Pressure\", and \"Big Shot\" for \"Just The Way You Are\" (a curious omission), \"She's Got A Way\", and \"Don't Ask Me Why\", for example. At the end of the day, though, what says it all for me is the simple branding of this incredible CD with the succinct caption \"Words and Music by Billy Joel\". All great music, and it's all his. Phenomenal. You'll reach for this CD early and often. I know I do. No one CD can hold all of his hits, but this \"The Hits\" release comes pretty close! Few CD's can boast such wall-to-wall quality.

{"text": "BILLY JOEL-THE HITS: For most people, BILLY JOEL has always been a love or hate proposition...perhaps \"hate\" is too strong a word...some merely choose to dismiss the Bronx balladeer's accomplishments. For casual fans, this single platter encapsulation of most (but hardly all) of his greatest hits will probably work better than his many double disc anthologies. That said, any sampler that leaves off the tin pan alley tribute JUST THE WAY YOU ARE and UPTOWN GIRL, the best ditty FRANKIE VALLI never did, is sorely lacking something. Those caveats aside, the Bronx born belter's autobiographical breakthrough PIANO MAN, credibility attempt IT'S STILL ROCK & ROLL TO ME and tongue twisting historical laundry list WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE are still fun to revisit even if you've heard 'em hundreds of times.

Billy,there was I time when I could not wait until your new album came out, back... in the 70's, 80's, and 90's.  Now I just think of you doing your songs over and over again in concert just to make a buck.  Hey, guess what!! Shaun Cassidy can sing...Da Do Do Run Run and That's Rock and Roll over again and again also.  That is what you have turned in to. What happened to my GREAT song writer?  He became, David and Shaun Cassidy. WHAT A WAIST!!!!I I have spent a fortune on buying your albums, 45's, cassettes, and then CD's and DVD's.  You actually think you don't owe your fans anything but a new LIVE album every 3 years? What is next? Billy Joel Live at \" Super America\" ?  Get a free \" Slurppie\" with purchase.

{"text": "Normally, I would say that this compilation is a good, cheap, single disc primer for the uninitiated. And it is. If you've never heard of Billy Joel before, this isn't a bad place to start. Theoretically.The problem is, I've lost count of how many \"best of\" compilations Columbia/Sony has put out there...most of them more comprehensive than this. The 2-disc \"The Essential...\" is only $1.50 more than this here on Amazon. \"Essential 3.0...\" (even more comprehensive), is just another $5 more.Old fans already have everything here, and new fans are better served by other compilations that are only slightly more expensive. So the point of this new \"Hits\" compilation is....?What Sony should be doing is putting out QUALITY remasters of Billy's back catalog (the 30th anniversary \"The Stranger\" does NOT qualify as \"quality\"; WAY too loud). Credit must be given that the last round of remasters from the late 90's were done well (excluding the annoying tiny video clips), but technology has moved on since then and the discography is in dire need of a good update. This the fans would probably appreciate.Or Billy should just get off his duff and start writing songs again and put out a new album. For a man who has \"retired\", he sure tours with the old workhorses a lot.Still, if you MUST own ONLY a single disc compilation...if you're \"merely curious\" and don't want to dive in...I guess this is a good as any. There's nothing but quality music here. But it is a sorely incomplete picture of his career (as any single disc would be), and you can get better for just a little bit more. And you'll want more; trust me on that. Your money is best spent elsewhere.\n", "val": 6.686014967272058e-05}

{"text": "When you think of classic musical acts, there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the Piano Man, Billy Joel. It has nearly been 40 years since he released his debut album, and his songs past and present have stood the test of time in a incredible way. While it has honestly been more than a decade since he made his final studio album, 1993's River Of Dreams, he still holds his own beautifully by delivering the strong songs that have been staples of great music. With the new success of his music being recognized with his documentary, The Last Play At Shea, focusing in on his music as well as being showcased as the final act to perform at the former home of the New York Mets, and being the first to deliver a rock concert at Yankee Stadium back in 1990. Now set to celebrate his 40th anniversay, a new new hits collection is out there to re-introduce Billy Joel's classics to a new era.Billy Joel - The Hits is a single disc retrospective of Billy Joel's big hits on one album. While the songs have all been remastered nicely, it honestly is a collection of great to a younger era of those who've never owned a Billy Joel album before. Still, the collection does deliver nearly all of his big hits including The River Of Dreams, the #1 hit We Didn't Start The Fire, his signature staple Piano Man, and the intimate New York State Of Mind, and Big Shot. While the collection of songs stands well on a single disc, there are so many of Billy's biggest songs that sadly weren't here. The biggest shocker is his standout song Uptown Girl, as well as favorites like the Grammy-winning Just The Way You Are, Don't Ask Me Why as well as many others. It honestly is also a surprise that a standout like The Downeaster Alexa wasn't here, in place of one of Billy's lesser-known hits like Everybody Loves You Now. That simply is the biggest fluke of the record.All in all, despite a lot of Billy Joel's great classics not being recognized, Billy Joel - The Hits isn't definitive from what has made him the Piano Man to sing us the songs tonight. It honestly isn't as definitive as was the case with Billy's better hits collections like The Essential Billy Joel (2001,) or his distinctive Greatest Hits Volume I & Volume II which sold over 21 million copies in America alone, and remains the highest-selling greatest hits record by a solo artist. I honestly can't recommend this hits collection for the ultimate Billy Joel fan, but a noble sampler for anyone whom has yet to hear a ode from the Piano Man. What makes Billy Joel? It honestly wasn't everything here.Album Cover: BSongs: C+Price: C+Remastering: BOverall: C+\n", "val": 0.04227454587817192}
{"text": "Folks, this isn't Billy's decision.  Well...at least not directly.  A lot of this catalog crap is 100% a record label decision.  Especially in Billy's case, where he hasn't put any real pop albums out in almost two decades.  The record company will keep putting these out to get money out of people.Sure, Billy won't turn down the residuals.  Who would?But please know this about record labels...they can (and will) do this as often as they want.  And these simplistic collections (not expansive box sets) are easy to produce and actually sucker people in to buy.  And people actually will buy them.  If you're a real fan, you already have these songs and don't need them on another disc.  (Count me in that group.)  But stop with the anger at Billy for being greedy or trying to trick us.  This is a record label thing, plain and simple.  Direct all of your scorn at them.I'll still give it a decent rating because I love this music that I already own.\n", "val": 0.0013622259721159935}

I feel like that though on their new one Changed. I was a little disappointed with the side part that shows what cd it is. IT'S NOT RED! All my RF cd's stick out because it's not red. I guess I cannot get everything.Absolute favorite songs: I won't let go, Easy, and Nothing Like this.The other ones are great but those are my favorites.Get it!

{"text": "For 25 YEARS, I've been wanting Baltimora on CD, so I hung onto the original US cassette (red cover) and US 8-song reissue vinyl (blue cover)...it's great this came out, I ordered it, now I can get rid of the tape, as all 6 cuts are on the CD and remastered.  The vinyl also has a single edit of \"The Juke Box Boy\", a great song where the full 12\" is here on the CD...but the catchy instrumental \"Up With Baltimora\" is missing, so I'm still hanging onto the vinyl with that song and 2 single mixes...JBB and \"Living In The Background\"...had no idea about the 2nd album \"Survivor In Love\" from 1987...heard the song \"Key Key Karimba\" on YouTube...cool song.  For me, the Baltimora sound is NOT about \"Tarzan Boy\" at all...it's a cute novelty song, nothing more...no, for me, it's all about killer Euro Cretu-ish fare like \"Living In The Background\" and ESPECIALLY the moody and beautiful \"Chinese Restaurant\"...one of THE best songs of all time.  But that's what happens with bands that have 1 hit as a novelty, they get dismissed as nothing else they did matters...it should have been that \"Chinese Restaurant\" was the hit and they they may have had a longer career...As for the controversy of who fronted the band and Jimmy...hearing about it and listening again...it's absolutely clear that keyboardist/songwriter/producer Maurizio Bassi WAS the lead singer on these recordings, NOT Jimmy McShane (RIP), who only sang harmonies on the recordings...how can you tell??  Jimmy was Irish...Maurizio and the rest of the band are Italian...the vocalist on these tracks had an ITALIAN accent!!  Nothing against Jimmy...also, many of the songs involved male/female relations...and Jimmy was gay...just saying, the pieces add up to Maurizio being the actual singer in Baltimora, and he's still alive...Jimmy was a great dancer though!!Classic stuff regardless...and remember, it;s about \"Chinese Restaurant\", NOT \"Tarzan Boy\"...the ballad \"Pull The Wires\" could also be passed over as well...it's just alright.\n", "val": 0.00014614383690059185}

The music takes me back to the 1980s where life seemed more simpler in it's day.I am glad that I bought the compact disc after all this time. It was worth the money. I don't know much else about Baltimora. In fact, it was for the Tarzan Boy song that I was driven to make this purchase.

{"text": "The new Christmas record by Jessica Simpson is a real great piece of music because she's singing like in the past. You can hear her powerful clear voice. On her last album \"Do you know\" her voice sounded rough a bit but on \"Happy Christmas\" she is singing like an angel and if you hear it you will agree with me. Jess is showing her vocal skills in perfection. You can hear a powerful,high,low and always touching and soft voice.My Only WishVery nice fast up-tempo song with a nice melody and clear vocals.The music has a saxophone, sleigh bells and a piano part.Here Comes Santa Claus/Santa Claus is Coming to Town)This one is one of my faves... nice medley and it brings lots of fun into the songs.The song has good guitar parts electro and acoustic and a nice bridge with a background choir.O Come O Come EmmanuelThis song is a bit comparable with \"what child is this\" (from Rejoyce). The music is piano with a string orchestra... very emotional atmosphere and one of the highlights. Jess is showing what she's able to do with her voice. Its very powerful...I'll Be Home For Christmas (duet with John Britt)I'm surprised. I never expected that this duet would be so good.John is making a good job here. The music is slow, with a soft cymbal beat and a string orchestra with typical Christmas sounds (decent).Happy Xmas (War Is Over)One of the most famous Christmas songs ever. Jess is singing very powerful and gives her own interpretation to this song.6. Mary Did You KnowThe music is like a typical ballad made for Jess. The sound is near to I wanna love you forever...The vocals are very clear, powerful and touching too...7. Merry Christmas Baby (duet with Willie Nelson)This song is the only country styled Christmas song on this album with electric and acoustic guitar, piano and a Hammond organ. Its sounds like a big band performance - awesome.The vocals of Jess are showing a wide range of tones... its very special but it sounds good and different to the other tracks.Kiss Me For ChristmasA soft slow beat with a piano, it's a silent song.The music is styled like a typical ballad for Jessica - and that's what she can perform so amazingly.Have Yourself a Merry Little ChristmasThis song has a string orchestra and piano with a soft cymbal beat with a very clear voice...Carol of the BellsIts nice how Jess is imitating the bells (ding dong ding dong). I never heard this song before. It's a very interesting melody and a good choir in the background.The music is typical Christmas sound with sleigh bells, electric guitar,piano and strings orchestra.Hidden Track 1 (Jingle Bell Rock)Jessica's voice, a background choir, a band with sleigh bell-drums, piano and an acoustic guitar...The piano solo part between the verses is very nice to hear.Hidden Track 2 (Silent night)Very silent, very touching...Classic bells are ringing, a string orchestra is accompany to Jessica's voice. It sounds very harmonic and fits together perfectly...Jess is showing that shes still able to sing very emotional.CONCLUSIONThere is no bad song on the record. Jess is showing that she's still one of the most talented female vocal acts we have. Everyone who liked the 1st Christmas record will love this one.I hope this record is her step back into music and we can look forward to a new studio album in the next year.Thanks Jessica, you've done everything right on this record.I don't had Christmas feelings but after this record I'm waiting for Santa :-)Nice greetings froma german supporter...\n", "val": 0.03251175209879875}

{"text": "Jessica Simpson has released a fine album of holiday music; she is in great shape throughout, singing very well as she never misses a beat! She is in top form here, with sophisticated phrasing, excellent timing and diction--and her vocals are front and center as they should be! The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very nicely done.\"My Only Wish\" starts the track set off with a tune that has lots of energy and Jessica sings this as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing--but of course we know it really isn't all that easy; Jessica's talent carries her through! The medley entitled \"Here Comes Santa Claus / Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" is relentlessly upbeat and the somewhat country flavor of the musical arrangement enhances the medley even more--excellent! \"O Come O Come Emmanuel\" has Jessica delivering this with great sensitivity; and that's grand. She sings this straight from her heart and the piano arrangement adds to the song to make it really special.\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" has Jessica doing some nice work with John Britt; and that percussion makes the number fine along with her excellent singing; Jessica Simpson delivers a fine interpretation of this classic ballad. \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" has Jessica playing with the tempo ever so slightly to put her own stamp on this song. In addition, \"Mary Did You Know\" stuns me with its beauty.\"Merry Christmas Baby\" has Jessica doing fine work with Willie Nelson; and it all holds its own very well. They sound terrific together and it's a highlight of the album to be sure! \"Kiss Me for Christmas\" is very well done; and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" is smooth and beautiful in Jessica's capable hands. \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" also sports a somewhat jazzy flavor to it and that works very well to make it strong! The album then has Jessica performing \"Carol of the Bells\" flawlessly before going into two excellent, bonus hidden tracks, \"Jingle Bell Rock\" with some mighty fine percussion, piano and guitar work and \"Silent Night\" which uses the strings to great advantage.If you're looking for a high quality control album of holiday music, then this is a fine album for you! In addition, Jessica Simpson fans would do well to add this to their collections.\n", "val": 0.043553415685892105}

{"text": "I was out christmas shopping today and the store I was in was playing this cd in the background.  When I went to purchase my item I heard the store manager talking with a worker standing behind me.  The manager asked what music they were playing and the worker responded \"the new Jessica Simpson Christmas cd\".  I heard the manager then reply \"can you please stop the music, it's scaring the customers and it's really bad for business.\"  I was so enthralled and fascinated at this point I had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she was so insistant that they cut the cd off.  I went online later and listened to \"Happy Christmas\" and found out myself why.  It was truely awful.  I'm sorry I don't want to hear Jessica Simpson singing christmas carols when it sounds like she needed to blow her nose every song.  Jessica Simpson is just a strange creature.  Why does she continue to make music?  It really tells me something when there is only 12 reviews on here.  Plus she dates athletes.  Creepy.\n", "val": 4.4479165808297694e-05}
{"text": "Usually you pick up some pop artists Christmas album and you might find one or two songs that you like, but the rest you tend to skip over.

{"text": "Christmastime is upon us once again.  We hold what is near and dear close to us, spend time with special people and glory in a time of year where hopefully people are trying to be better to one another.  It is also the time of year for Christmas cds.  Almost every singer seems to have one.  What sets them apart?  It is totally the intent behind it.  It's a quick money maker for some and then you have those who truly love the season and want to use their craft to share their feelings with others.  That is what Jessica does here.  I own many Christmas cds and after only the first listen this one is my favorite.  This is a mature Jessica singing classic songs with respect, singing some new songs with happiness and the listener can't help but get in the spirit.  One often forgets that Jessica started out as purely a singer and she possessed an awesome vocal range and tackled songs from pop, ballads and gospel with pure emotion.  This is a talented woman.  She then had some commercial releases and now she has a gift for us.  She returns to the roots of her talent, her pure and strong vocals.The cd opens like holiday magic with MY ONLY WISH.  It sets the holiday tone and it never lets up.  She puts magic into pop classics like SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN and HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS.  She treats the spiritual classics O COME O COME EMMANUEL and MARY DID YOU KNOW with much respect.  The instrumentation on this whole cd is great but in the forefront are Jessica's beautiful vocals.  No gimmicks.  Just heartfelt emotions and her vocal talent and range in full display.  Her joy for this season is very apparent.  She cowrote MY ONLY WISH and KISS ME FOR CHRISTMAS.  CAROLS OF THE BELLS is awe-inspiring with perfect vocals from Jessica used throughout.  She sings the lead and her voice is used for all the background vocals including the bells.  Exsquisite and heartwarming.  And we get the sexy, fun Jessica on MERRY CHRISTMAS BABY sung with Willie Nelson.There are two bonus tracks here - JINGLE BELL ROCK and SILENT NIGHT.  Bottom line, Jessica puts her heart and soul into this cd.  She belts with heart and carefully caresses where need be.  Her vocals are exsquisite whatever the type of song.  She has never sounded better.  So cuddle with your loved one, put up the tree or have a hot mug of your favorite beverage and put on Jessica.  She will bring joy, emotion and the true feelings of the holidays into whatever you are doing.  I give the highest kudos to Jessica.  I planned on liking this cd but am thrilled that it has instead become a classic that will be a part of every holiday season for me from now on.  Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.024862298741936684}

Well, Jess's album is catchy and includes 2 tracks that aren't even listed on the CD (which is a nice surprise)!The only thing that really disappointed me what the booklet. I always enjoy them but this one is really simple. It shows the lyrics for the 10 listed songs and the back page is showing 6 minature polaroids of Jess and Family @Christmas and her thank you's. The record company could have done better. But I guess they were trying to keep the costs down.Overall, I am glad I bought it. The first song (My only wish) is catchy and should certainly be picked up by radio stations as part of the annual Christmas song rotation. (It's as catchy as Maria or Britney's song).\n", "val": 0.004796931054443121}

I'm not a fan of 99% of his music, but his raise to fame is a classic American Dream story.  I'm not endorsing his rock & roll life style, but its always refreshing to see that the American Dream still works. Born Free is now the 4th Kid Rock single I've added to my library.  I'm a fan of the classic rock of the 60s/70s. Groups like AC/DC and Ozzy have carried the classic rock sound through the 80s & 90s.  Its refreshing to listen to classic rock, no matter when its made or who is making it.  Born Free will join All Summer Long as tunes that will be played through the coming decades.

I don't care that she throws around f-bombs like petunias at a Jessica-Lange garden party. I don't care that she takes stupid, predictable pot-shots at Holy Church in her videos. I don't care that she writes self-righteous letters for dumb, trendy causes. And I don't even like \"Don't Let Me Get Me.\"But she enchants like a siren.\"Glitter in the Air,\" \"Raise Your Glass,\" and \"Sober.\" \"Who Knew?\" and \"So What?\" \"Just Like a Pill\" and \"Please Don't Leave Me.\" Are you kidding me? One poke-me-cause-Im-dreaming work of excellence after another.If I could get away with it, I would sing the chorus of \"F'''''' Perfect\" to everyone. I cry every time I hear it.I am not ashamed to admit that I love P!nk and wish her happiness with her newborn baby girl.\"on June 8, 2011 at 12:28 amFather JoeI am sorry, but I do not understand. Admittedly, I cannot wrap my brains around a number of your posts. I am unable to figure out what is going on. Years ago some of our teens at St. Mary's had a dance where a teen went to the deejay and asked him not to play a questionable song. His response was this was the \"clean version.\" This wonderful teen objected, \"That does not matter because there is still a dirty version and we want no part of it.\" I was so proud of her. We do not want to lend support, moral or monetary, to those who vulgarize our society and attack the Church. We also should do all we can not to render scandal. I suspect there is some meaning or higher value that you are trying to communicate. But maybe I am too old fashioned and closed-minded to see it? Like I said, I cannot figure this out. All I can do is pray for you and your new ministry. Amicus certus in re incerta cernitur.\"\n", "val": 0.000709599640686065}

Yet, she hasn't had a really strong set of songs which was well widely accepted with Funhouse. But it has been a decade since Pink embarked her own success after conquering physical and emotional abuse from drugs and her parents divorce. But her latest songs isn't her biggest slice of the pie. Raise Your Glass, the lead single from Pink's upcoming greatest hits album isn't a song that really stood out like her bigger songs had shown. While the song isn't a bad song, but not anything really over the top from her. While it is sure to please die hard Pink fans, it just wasn't anything really to rave about.

The music video, with its oh-so-shocking visuals of cows feeding on human breast milk (very avant-garde) and footage of Pink making that stupid angry-party-face in front of some random skatepark (I hear Pink's popping 360 flips down stairs these days) is really a bang-head-against-wall affair.

One in particular involved summer activities for the school kids whom I was with. We were told by the nuns to choose which summer activity we preferred. Among the choices were swimming, hiking, biking, etc. For some reason I choose  'photography'. I was told to go to a church on Dolores St. in the central part of San Francisco. Upon arrival I saw a large camera set up on the front entrance landing of the church. It was one of those old cameras, the kind that had a hood blanket that would go over you as you took a picture of somebody. So they put me behind this camera, and I was taking pictures of some broad (woman). Later that day I went with two technicians, down into the basement of the church. They brought me into a 'dark room', the kind with the little red light bulbs. They then showed me how to slosh the film in these trays of liquid. Then they started cracking jokes as they were making enlargements of parts of the picture. What I have never forgotten about this experience is asking myself the question; 'What is all this equipment doing underneath some church.'\n", "val": 7.706454925937578e-05}

{"text": "Let me make this perfectly clear.  I love Alan.  Think he is one of the last pure country artists out there.  BUT, the corporate greed has turned me against him and what this CD represents.  I mean, is it really fair to make a true dedicated fan, to go out in these hard times, and buy yet another greatest hits CD, just so we can have a complete collection, or the few extra songs they put on the cd to entice the fan to buy it even moreso?  It's not right I say.  It shows that it has nothing to do with music, but money.  thats the bottom line with these compilations, just money.  Squeeze us for all they can get, and it is a form of stealing, done right in front of us.  I bought Alan's music on album, then cassette, then CD, then video, then DVD, and still the greatest hits came out, i got those, both of those, and now, a new concept, #1's.  It's no better when George Strait does it, or any artist because it's ripping off the people that put them there in the first place.  i wish the artists, I wish Alan would see this, and realize it.  have you ever seen his fan club newsletter?  It's like 1 - 2 pages of news about Alan, and the rest of the newsletter, like 20 pages is all merchandising.  I just think it's not right.  It's exploiting the artist and screwing the fan in the end.  It's a good CD for someone just passing through Alan's extensive history and just wants to skim the cream of the crop of his library of music, but then that isn't right either.  A fan listens to the whole of albums, even if, if not moreso especially the music that doesnt get on radio.  Those songs show the true music and character of the artist.  Greatest hits, #1 cd's, whatever you want to call them, they are just not cool, and when an artist releases them, to me, i put them down a peg.\n", "val": 7.478040788555518e-05}

{"text": "The title of this review pretty much sums up how I feel about my favorite male country music singer, Alan Jackson. Ever since I saw him open for Randy Travis back in 1990 when \"Here In The Real World\" (Alan's first #1) came out I knew Alan was destined to be not only a country music singer, but a country music superstar with staying power. He has always been a man who has never disappointed his audience with his pure country music songs, most of which he has written himself. He is widely regarded, along with Garth Brooks, for changing the face of country music in the early '90's, by giving country its roots back after the industry in Nashville became too pop-sounding. In this excellent two-disc CD set fans get a complete overview of Alan's remarkable twenty year career with every single of his remarkable 34 #1 songs along with three new singles. Highlights include \"Don't Rock The Jukebox\", \"Dallas\", \"Wanted\", \"Chatahoochee\", \"Summertime Blues\", and my favorite of all his compositions \"Remember When\", a song he wrote for his wife Denise. The package also contains the healing 9 11 song \"Where Were You When The World Stopped Turning?\", Alan's masterpiece in his response to the terrorist attacks in 2001. The three new songs in the set include a remake of Johnny Cash's \"Ring of Fire\" with Lee Ann Womack and \"As She's Walking Away\" with the Zac Brown Band. An amazing career set, Alan's \"34 #1's\" is not only for the ardent Alan Jackson fan, but for lovers of music who would like to own material from one of the most honored male singers in the last twenty years.

{"text": "Let me make this perfectly clear. I love Alan. Think he is one of the last pure country artists out there. BUT, the corporate greed has turned me against him and what this CD represents. I mean, is it really fair to make a true dedicated fan, to go out in these hard times, and buy yet another greatest hits CD, just so we can have a complete collection, or the few extra songs they put on the cd to entice the fan to buy it even moreso? It's not right I say. It shows that it has nothing to do with music, but money. thats the bottom line with these compilations, just money. Squeeze us for all they can get, and it is a form of stealing, done right in front of us. I bought Alan's music on album, then cassette, then CD, then video, then DVD, and still the greatest hits came out, i got those, both of those, and now, a new concept, #1's. It's no better when George Strait does it, or any artist because it's ripping off the people that put them there in the first place. i wish the artists, I wish Alan would see this, and realize it. have you ever seen his fan club newsletter? It's like 1 - 2 pages of news about Alan, and the rest of the newsletter, like 20 pages is all merchandising. I just think it's not right. It's exploiting the artist and screwing the fan in the end. It's a good CD for someone just passing through Alan's extensive history and just wants to skim the cream of the crop of his library of music, but then that isn't right either. A fan listens to the whole of albums, even if, if not moreso especially the music that doesnt get on radio. Those songs show the true music and character of the artist. Greatest hits, #1 cd's, whatever you want to call them, they are just not cool, and when an artist releases them, to me, i put them down a peg.\n", "val": 5.708079697797075e-05}

Just like the title says, it has all of Alan's 34 number one Country hits, plus, finally, the release of AJ's version of the Cash classic \"Ring of Fire.\" Those farmiliar with this cover will already know, it was recorded for the soundtrack of a great film called \"Cowboy Up.\" But the movie studio had some funding issues that delayed the film, and sandbagged the soundtrack. Many great Country artists had their recordings put on the shelf for it, including Alan. This single track is highly sought-after by fans, and now we have it. Also, this is the only place on an Alan Jackson album we can find his collaboration with the Zac Brown Band on \"As She's Walking Away.\" Another great addition to the set.Overall, we may have heard all these songs for years on the radio, but it is so nice to have them all in a single collection. Perfect for the road trip, sitting in front of the stereo, of getting pumped up for that next AJ and the Stayhorns concert.For newcomers to Alan's music, this marks the perfect stsrting point. Every song you heard on the radio, plus some you might not have. Start here, and work your way back.Terrific release!\n", "val": 0.006402279250323772}

{"text": "Whenever an artist --- any artist --- puts out a \"best-of\" set, there are always people who lash out at the concept of a \"best-of,\" and it's always the same old stuff: The \"best-of\" is unnecessary because the songs are available on their albums (and  on other \"best-ofs\"), so the \"best-of\" is purely for money. Well, I don't \"buy\" that (at least not in all cases)! A \"best-of\" can have several positive points. Sure, every artist has their die-hard fans who have all of their albums and singles, but they also have their more \"casual\" fans who like and have some of their stuff but not a lot of it (they might prefer a \"best-of\" over an album), and other die-hard fans who have most if not all of their songs but still like a good \"best-of,\" even if they already have at least one. Having a lot if not all of an artist's best songs in one set is pretty handy, especially if the set has as many songs as this one does. And, when someone doesn't have and hasn't heard any of an artist's songs but wants to give them a try, a \"best-of\" can be a good place to start. Also, some \"best-ofs\" are more up to date and/or better than others. If someone only has one or two \"best-ofs\" by a particular artist (or none at all), and there are several of them out, then there is a good selection of them for the person to decide between (if they want any of them at all). I'm not much into country music, but I consider myself a \"casual\" Alan Jackson fan. I had the 20-song Greatest Hits Collection that came out in '95, but no other Alan Jackson CDs. Sure, 34 Number 1s has the songs that Greatest Hits has, but it also has 17 others, which are later songs than the ones on Greatest Hits. I don't mind getting songs I already have if I think that a \"best-of\" is as good as this one; I think it's even better than Greatest Hits. Alan Jackson is one of the very, very few country artists who have done even one or two songs that I really like, and he's done many (comparatively, anyway). All of them are on 34 Number 1s. Alan doesn't deserve criticism for this collection; he deserves thanks. THANKS, ALAN!!\n", "val": 0.0033358056098222733}
{"text": "I've always respected Mr. Jackson, although I could only call myself a casual fan. His career is one of the longer ones, by modern standards of radio-dependent commercial country music, and I've purchased a couple of his albums over the past two decades. I always liked his affection for traditional artists, those who toiled prior to about 1970, for instance. However, only about six of these 37 songs were actually familiar to me. And on this two-CD set, only about six tracks are songs I don't really need to hear more than once. The rest are very listenable, some quite powerful. To get songs this good, in such quantity, for under ten bucks is a deal no country music fan of any era should resist. Most of my listening happens while driving around my city for my job duties, and Alan Jackson and his various bands, producers and song writers are fine companions indeed.\n", "val": 0.017208050936460495}
{"text": "Alan Jackson will ultimately go down in country music history primarily for the music he made for Arista records, although we hope that he still has some great music to come, whichever label he signs for. The singles from his last Arista album of original recordings, the excellent Freight train, didn't do as well as those from his earlier albums. Initially, I wondered if American country radio stations were losing interest, but maybe Arista were switching their focus to younger artists. This compilation therefore becomes the last official compilation of Alan's Arista music. No doubt there will others in the years to come, but they will just recycle the material already released, together with whatever unreleased material lies in the Arista vaults.The title implies that 34 of these 37 tracks were number one hits, but they weren't all number one of the American Billboard country charts. Most of the others came close, so maybe they were number ones on some other chart such as Cashbox (I don`t have access to Cashbox charts, so cannot check). Here in the real world (the title track of his first Arista album), didn't make number one on Billboard but was number one on the Canadian country chart, but all of Alan's other Canadian number ones were also number one on Billboard. Still, whether the title is accurate or not, it is fair to say that every track here is excellent.As others have pointed out, some of Alan's hits that didn't make this compilation are also of a high quality. It would have been easy for Arista to compile a triple CD, but they probably struck the right balance in limiting this compilation to a double CD. Still, the absence of tracks such as Murder on Music Row (with George Strait), When somebody loves you (a top five country hit), I'll go on loving you (a top three country hit), Mercury blues (a number two country hit), Everything I love, Pop a top and others shows that Alan had plenty of great hits besides what you'll find here.The three tracks not claimed as number ones ironically include one track that made it to number one on Billboard - As she's walking away, in which Alan joins the Zac Brown band. Ring of fire, a mellow cover of the old Johnny Cash classic, was a minor country hit when released as a single. The other new track, Look at me, may or may not have been released as a single, but it's a fine song.Whether or not there are 35 number one hits here doesn't matter; Alan had almost 50 top ten hits on the Billboard country charts, every one a gem, and some of those that didn't make the top ten (especially Murder on Music Row) are also regarded by many fans as classics. This collection provides a fitting tribute to Alan's 21 years of great music with Arista, whether this is your first Alan Jackson album or whether (like me) you have most of the tracks already.\n", "val": 0.003406934207305312}

{"text": "I tend to avoid albums like this, generally because by the time they are released, the tracks on them have appeared on up to half a dozen greatest hits sets already. For the life of me, I can't see any reason for albums like this, other than greed & the lust to milk the cash cow even further. It's a bit like DVD's where you get the original release, then the \"special edition\", then the 2-disc set with extra bits not seen in the theatre release, then the director's cut, then the \"ultimate edition\" and so on, ad nauseum. Lets get real here, the record companies are not stupid; they see a way to leech more money out of the die-hard fans, & they will. It's as simple as that! And sadly, none of the artists have the ethical conscience to say to the companies, \"hey, haven't we already released greatest hits albums?\" Why do we have to re-release them under a new cover, & call it a new release? It's all about the mighty dollar, baby, and they all do it. Now, having said that (& got my feelings of disgust for record companies of my back), this album has one (yes, just one) positive - it has one of the best cover versions of \"Ring of Fire\" that I have ever heard. Great vocals from Alan, great production, & great instrumental backing. Now this is the kind of number I'd like to hear Alan doing in future. Put \"Freight Train\" behind him (every artist is allowed to make one disaster in their career), and look to churning out numbers that have some life in them. Alan, go back to your roots, check out your first 3 or 4 albums, and start again. Lets have more of the kind of songs that put you on the map as a genuine country singer, and put an end to the lame & tame rubbish like \"Freight Train\".\n", "val": 0.002007463714107871}

The level of playing is just so high and authoritative you can't help but be amazed.  I'm not sure why this seemed so \"strange\" and a \"departure\" to record execs.  Most of the songs have a world influence which was starting to infiltrate pop music of the time (Peter Gabriel, YES for example).  The album would get 10 starts based on the musicianship, but the songs didn't quite grab me 100% the way their previous two releases did.  Mind you, I was a young pre-teen when those came out.  Overall, this is an enjoyable listen with a few skippers which is why I deducted the star.

{"text": "It's only been 23 years since this album should have been released.  A long time to be a fan to be sure, but I'm glad it finally was.  I knew about this album years ago and that it was shelved.  Never really thought it would see the light of day, but Richard Page made the jump to go ahead and release it as he had come out with a new solo album entitled 'Peculiar Life'.  This is a must have album for Mr. Mister fans and does follow on the wings of 'Go On...'.  While, 'Go On...\" didn't receive critical acclaim and thus, the disbanding of the band, that album was, by far, their best quality album of the three that they released.  Go to the 4th album 'Pull' and it's, yet again, a stellar album.  If it had been released after the 'Go On...' release it would have probably suffered the same fate.  Honestly, when the band broke it big with the single releases of 'Kyrie' and 'Broken Wings', that's all fans wanted to hear and when a band releases something entirely different, they lose their fan base.  Mr. Mister definitely matured after their second release, but fans weren't ready.  Both 'Go On...' and 'Pull' are exceptional albums and no listener should be disappointed.  Each album, not one bad song.  Enough said.\n", "val": 0.007573936600238085}
{"text": "This \"new\" Mr. Mr. album is their best. The songwriting is phenomenal--you can't go wrong with the team who writes hits for Josh Grobin, Al Jarreau, Kenny Loggins, Madonna, and...well...Mr. Mister.But there's much more to \"Pull\" than an assortment of potential Top Tens: the musicianship is sublime--check out Trevor Rabin's Yes-like, layered guitar playing on about half the songs; and bask in the almost choir-like harmonies which, a usual, float above the sometimes jagged/sometimes angelic rhythm section.As always, the lyrics are a pleasure. These gentlemen consistently communicate a theme without being heavy-handed or regressing into the deadly realm of The Concept Album. \"Pull\" seems to suggest a tension between conflicting worldviews, but as with any great art (Did I just admit that this album is a work of art?) there is enough ambiguity to make a thinking person ponder some of life's mysteries.I just hope there is enough support fo this incomparable album that Mr. Page, Mr. Mastelleto, Mr. George, and Mr. Lang can create several follow-ups--maybe even get Pat's present bandmate Mr. Belew to contribute a bit!\n", "val": 0.04509003832936287}

I think the songs are fantastic. As usual with everything Richard and Steve write together, there's that depth of songwriting, where each song grows after each listening.

I found the CD on Amazon, and bought several for gifts.

I was lucky because this was available for auto rip, so even though I placed an order for a CD (and haven't even received it yet)  I was able to pull it into a playlist before the order even shipped. This selection moved to the top of my Gregorian chant playlist.\n", "val": 0.010211225599050522}

{"text": "A timeless work of peace and awe and centuries old is captured in this recording of Gregorian Chant by the Benedictine Nuns of the Abbaye de Notre-Dame de l'Annonciation. One of the Sisters had mentioned that the goal of this CD was to help provide `a sense of peace' for the listener. Well, I speak for myself, but I can see I'm clearly echoed and not alone in agreeing that the soothing and inspiring group of voices singing age old chants achieves just that. It can be perfect to help one unwind after a stressful day or at anytime. The singing also gently inspires a sense of contemplation into the deeper nature of the world and the general mystery of life. You don't have to be necessarily Catholic or religious to enjoy this; you'll hopefully come away with a sense of gratitude and a deep appreciation for the art of Chant and its calming yet haunting effect. It's ideal to use while relaxing outside or while driving home, or even when you retire to bed. Essentially, it's a great collection of Chants ideal for whenever you can find time.\n", "val": 0.0325017087161541}

{"text": "Sought out by record executives from the Universal Music record label, Decca Records, who had identified them as the finest female chant choir in the world, the Benedictine Nuns of Notre-Dame De L Annonciation agreed to make a chant recording. This recording is a Gregorian Chant project, called \"Voices- ChantFrom Avignon\", (Avignon, France is where their abbey is located). \"Voices- Chant From Avignon\" is a thematic album revisiting the journey of the two disciples of Jesus Christ, on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). It is broken into three parts. Part One is entitled \"Sadness in Life\". \"Sadness in Life\" reflects upon the sadness these two disciples were experiencing as they walked along the road to Emmaus. Their sadness came as they recounted the suffering and crucifixion of their Lord. As they are walking along, they are joined by a stranger, they do not recognize. We then come to Part Two. Part Two is entitled \"Stay With Us\". This part of the recording continues with the Emmaus journey, once they reach their house at Emmaus. By the time of their arrival at Emmaus, it is already nightfall. So these two disciples practice hospitality, and invite the stranger to \"Stay With Us\". It is in the \"Breaking of the Bread\", that these two disciples recognize that the stranger is in fact, Jesus Christ. The Benedictine Nuns of Notre-Dame De L Annonciation remind us, that we need to show the same care and concern for others, that these two disciples showed to the stranger they encountered. The stranger they encountered, turned out to be Jesus Christ. The concluding part of the recording is Part Three. Part Three is entitled \"Burning Hearts\". \"Burning Hearts\" refers to the state of the two disciples' hearts, as they had journeyed with, and finally recognized the Risen Christ. The Benedictine Nuns of Notre-Dame De L Annonciation would like to remind us, that like those two disciples, we too are on a journey with Jesus Christ, on the road to Paradise. \"Voices- Chant From Avignon\" is of course a chant music recording, and chant music is vocal music, there are no instruments. The chant music of \"Voices- Chant From Avignon\" is prayerful, peaceful, contemplative, and transcendent. This music points to the eternal, not the temporary. It is truly one of the finest chant recordings ever released by a female chant choir. The whole album is excellent, but please don't miss the well known chant/hymn by Saint Thomas Aquinas \"Adoro te\", another well known chant/hymn \"Veni Sancte Spiritus\", and one more well known chant/hymn \"Ubi Caritas\". All the texts of the chants are taken from the Psalms, Lamentations, the book of Jeremiah, and the Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament. The lyrics and melodies of the hymns are composed by the composers and writers of the hymns. \"Voices- Chant From Avignon\" is a special recording. It is a blessing for anyone who listens to it.

{"text": "Gregorian Chant is a unique form of music that is best described by scholars as 'the central tradition of Western plainchant, a form of monophonic liturgical music within Western Christianity that accompanied the celebration of Mass and other ritual services. It is named after Pope Gregory I, Bishop of Rome from 590 to 604, who is traditionally credited for having ordered the simplification and cataloging of music assigned to specific celebrations in the church calendar. The resulting body of music is the first to be notated in a system ancestral to modern musical notation. In general, the chants were learned by the viva voce method, that is, by following the given example orally, which took many years of experience in the Schola Cantorum. Gregorian chant originated in monastic life, in which celebrating the 'Divine Office' eight times a day at the proper hours was upheld according to the Rule of St. Benedict. Singing psalms made up a large part of the life in a monastic community, while a smaller group and soloists sang the chants. In its long history, Gregorian chant has been subjected to many gradual changes and some reforms.'  There are times when a bit of historical data aids the listener in appreciating the  art of Gregorian Chant.The various chants on this well-recorded CD are impeccably executed buy both solo and chorus from the Nuns of the Abbaye de Notre-Dame de l'Annonciation, a remote order of nuns from Avignon, France.  This order dates to the 6th century and is a secluded order - once the nuns take the vow to be a part of this Convent they must remain there until they die.  Our only connection these nuns is through their music and they are so fine in their use of the Gregorian Chant that they have won awards and earned the honor of being allowed to record their incandescent singing.  This is meditative music at its best, but it is also an example for music scholars of the purity of Gregorian Chant.  Grady Harp, April 11\n", "val": 0.010242640040814877}

{"text": "I admit it. I'm a sucker for the violin. Like many people, I love a good violin concerto perhaps more than most kinds of orchestral works. Maybe that's part of the reason I believe this may well be the best \"99 most whatever\" set so far.And it is even better that it is possible to get this set for free. Amazon MP3 published a link to a three-dollar promotional code on its Facebook page November 22, which renders this set free at the \"Daily Deal\" price on November 24, 2010, with some change to spare.The 99 tracks here really consist of 38 works, which include practically all the major standard repertory concertos -- the Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Sibelius, the first Bruch, and the first two Paganini concertos. The Beethoven \"Spring\" Sonata is also a popular \"greatest hit\" from classical music.There are also a number of other great full-length works. On the modern side, there is the second Prokofiev concerto. The melancholy Elgar sonata is a great addition, and Ravel's \"Tzigane\" played by Igor Oistrakh is a real treat. I am also glad to get a nice version of Saint-Saens \"Introduction and Rondo Capriccio\" into my collection through this set.The baroque and classical periods, which produced beautiful violin music but often lack the virtuoso fireworks of modern standard repertory violin concertos, are also featured heavily. The highlight here is probably the old warhorse, Vivaldi's Four Seasons, which X5 has trotted out in at least excerpted form in most of these \"99\" collections -- but here at least in a satisfying new version (for buyers in the series) featuring Yehudi Menuhin. Other Vivaldi works include \"L'Estro Harmonico\" and \"Il Ritiro\".Bach is well represented with the Concerto for Two Violins (again featuring Yehudi Menuhin), Violin Concertos 1 and 2, Sonata No. 1 and Partita No. 5. The latter solo violin works might be my least favorite in the set -- the playing by Conrad von der Goltz is good, but the pieces were recorded in a high-echo, reverb-heavy room which created a sound not quite to my taste. Yours may be different.There are four Mozart violin concertos (nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5), plus the Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola and a few other short works and excerpts.This set is based on a marketing tactic that must have been developed by an evil genius. In 14 of the longer works on offer, X5 has sold individual movements from the same performances in previous \"99\" sets -- but it is now adding the \"missing\" pieces to give the buyer the entire work. This is an ingenious way to sell things twice. However, at this price, I can accept it. Many of the short, single-movement works are also repeats from other sets in the series, such as the Meditation from Thais, the Beethoven Romances, or Arvo Part's \"Spiegel im Spiegel\".In some cases, full concertos are repeated from other \"99\" sets in the same performance -- for example, the Mendelssohn concerto or \"Il Ritiro\" from the Vivaldi set are straight repeats. However, in the case of Brahms and Tchaikovsky, the \"99\" sets focused on those composers had different full-length performances of the concertos.In my view, this collection is still well worth the price despite some repetition -- especially at the negligible Daily Deal price. The first movement of the Beethoven concerto alone -- featuring Christian Tetzlaff and the SWR Orchestra -- is probably worth it (the 2nd and 3rd movements were in the Beethoven set). Tetzlaff plays amazingly, and uses the Beethoven/Schneiderhan cadenzas, which are relatively seldom heard. Great stuff. The wonderfully melancholy Elgar sonata and even some of the Mozart and Bach concertos fill in some holes in my collection, and it's nice to have them here.The performances range from good to great. As we expect with these sets, the names often aren't the most famous, but the musicianship and recording quality are very good.This is a mammoth set, coming in at 12 hours and 35 minutes, with a total download size of 1.19 GB. As with all these collections, birates are variable. Sound is good, with average bitrates ranging from 210 to 247 kbps.Cannot be recommended too highly for people who are newish to classical music, and I think even people with serious collections should pick this one up. It's a solid set of valid musical interpretations -- five stars all around.UPDATE: Some people are asking for a composer breakdown, so by popular demand, here is a full album listing that includes track number, composer, title, violinist, and comments about repetition from previous sets:1-12. Vivaldi, The Four Seasons -- Yehudi Menuhin, violin. \"The Four Seasons\" shows up on just about every X5 set in some form, and a complete version was included in Vivaldi set.

{"text": "If you are a bargain hunter like myself, you already might have some of these recordings.  The violinist that really stands out here is Emmy Verhey from Holland.  She is an outstanding musician with an exceptional discography.  Her recording of the Tchaikovsky concerto is simply gorgeous.  I already owned it but I still downloaded this collection because of her Mozart and Bach recordings here.  Again they are simply wonderful.Then you have Ilya Grubert, another veteran whose recordings have been around for quite awhile.  His performance of the Sibelius is one of the finest I have ever heard.  Although his tempos are a tad slow, the music has much more meaning.So far my favorite recording is the Bach 2nd Violin Concerto, with Verhey.  It is incredibly passionate and it is not at all like some of the ultracold recordings by baroque specialists.  There is also a very interesting Fantasy by Robert Schumann played by the legendary Igor Oistrakh.  And for fun there are two famous works by Saint-Saens, brilliantly played by Viviane Hagner and Andrei Korsakov.It is really hard to believe this collection costs so little.

{"text": "I first heard Christina Perri from VH1's You Oughta Know Artist and it was the song \"Jar of Hearts\"... I immediately fell inlove. It's really hard these days to find honest and truly talented artists. Her voice is amazing. Her lyrics are true, easy to relate to and put together nicely. Her music is composed just right. She's just great to listen to and sing along with. This cd is so good...the only thing bad about it is it's only 5 songs...5 songs is not enough. I want more.So, this cd was recorded in a studio with a live band, and in ways you can tell...in other ways, you can't. Christina Perri doesn't need all the digitally mastered beats and auto tune to sound perfect (which doesn't really sound perfect or cool, just annoying) Although I will say I have times and moods when I enjoy it. My point is she's perfectly perfect without all that.\"Bang Bang Bang\" I actually liked a lot more than I thought I would just by listening to the :30sec clip. Listening to the entire song, it's just a very fun song to sing along with...especially if you've ever had someone stomp on your heart (which who hasn't). The chorus (which was surprisingly catchy to me) says, \"Bang bang bang boy, you're going down down down boy...to the ground where you left my heart to bleed. Bang! she shot you Karma tastes so sweet!\" The lyrics to the verses are a little less simple, not complicated but they say much more than the chorus and they're clever. This song gets 4/5.\"Black & Blue\" is a little more mellow than the first track and probably my least favorite on this 5 track ep. I'm not saying the song is bad, because it's not at all. It is in fact very good. At 2:37 the song is pretty short and could've probably been better if she made it longer and added more to it. I can't really say a lot about it because there's not a whole lot to it. What little of it there is, is enjoyable to say the least. This song gets 3/5\"Daydream\" is another mellow song. Lyrics, music, Christina's voice...just make this an overall great song. The vocal patterns on this song are also very good. She has a very different style than most artists these days. She talks about just loving someone in her daydream rather than in real life so she won't get hurt even though they want to be together. At least, that's what I got from it. I think it's a very good song, especially lyrically because I know I've felt that way before. This song gets 5/5\"Tragedy\" starts off with what I would consider a \"darker\" feel/sound (which I love to hear this sound because it's not done very often). She goes on to sing in the chorus, \"and I won't be made a fool, I don't call this love\". I want to say this is my favorite track on the cd but then I think of the other songs and it's just so hard to choose!!! But right now I think I'm saying this is my favorite track on the cd!! Haha. It seems like it's so full of emotion that you feel all the feelings you've had before about a certain situation. I love it. This song gets 5/5\"Jar of Hearts\" is to my knowledge the most popular song of Christina Perri's at the moment and the first song I'd ever heard by her. I obviously think it's good to have looked into her further and purchased this cd as well. She has the video out for this song as well which I think is a beautiful music video. This is how I would want my music video to be if I ever had one. I love the darker look of black and white with ashes and/or dead rose petals falling all around, ballet/interpretative dance, etc. I just love it! Back to the song...it's basically about a guy who is what some would call a \"player\", he goes around \"collecting his jar of hearts and tearing love apart\". It's another slower/mellow song with tons of emotion and a voice that sounds so pure and raw. This song gets 5/5I've said a lot. Overall this is a great album, you should buy it. You will love it, you will thank me. You will thank Christna Perri's parents for bringing her into this world to make awesome music for us to listen to. You will thank Christina Perri for following her dream/passion of music so that we can all listen to her.

{"text": "Just when I had given up on finding something new to listen to along comes Christina Perri. She has such an amazing + original voice. Jar of Hearts introduced Christina to the masses, and this EP shows just how great a singer/song writer she is. Bang Bang Bang has such a hook that you'll be singing it all day long and won't mind a bit. Can't wait to turn it up to 11 and sing along. Only downside is that w/ 5 songs you're left wanting more. Like a movie that ends but you know there will be a sequel. You kinda feel instantly sad + excited at the same time w/ the anticipation of more to come. I hope that she releases an album of all the awesome songs from her youtube posts. I just can't get enough. If Jar of Hearts is in your playlist this album is a must.

I really wasn't driven into this song from him, and the connection that he has with Drake just didn't feel like the sparks had flown. I just wasn't feeling that chemistry, and the song just missed that mark. While Drake had that well with Alicia Keys on Un-Thinkable, but here it just wasn't strong at all.

Fall For Your Type, the lead single from his 4th album Best Night Of My Life, isn't really a driven soul song. The feeling of the song is trying to re-ignite more of a darker tone into a ballad, but yet at times the song doesn't bring out what Jamie had been known for with music.

Trust me, I wanted to love \"Hidden Away\" but I just couldn't force something that I wanted to ultimately come naturally. In any case, seeing that it was new material from Josh, I bought the disc anyway in hoping I'd experience that same joy like that of listening to his previous releases. But no. I didn't feel that magic. I actually cringed. I'm sorry Josh but this lackluster production just doesn't pair well with your voice. I understand that you're channeling raw emotions into your performances but it didn't work. Your beautiful voice is meant for polished production, and should remain in the hands of David Foster.As I was listening to \"London Hymn\" in my room, my roommate texts to me... \"are you sleeping? it sounds like there are goats in your room.\" See Josh, that's not the kind of impression you'd want from \"potential\" fans.However, I did enjoy \"Straight To You\".

David Foster produced 5 star albums for Groban in which all or nearly every song was a masterpiece.  The change in style is a clear flop.  Cheesy songs include If I Walk Away, which sounds like a plinky yukule waltz; and Galileo; Voce - in which his gorgeous voice competes with an annoying drummer, banging away as if wanting too much attention.  I hate London Hymn which sounds like a church song with a creepy choir.  Good songs are L'Ora and Higher Window (although lyrics sound religious - yuck) and Hidden Away is good.  Josh:  Let David Foster produce your next album!  He is an annoying egotist - but knows how to produce - especially your kind of music.  Also, many of the songs on this and your last CD have simple, cheesy lyrics set to waltz rhythms which become too sing-songy.  Get a good lyracist.  Groban should have won 10 Grammies by now.

I didn't quite know what to expect, because Josh doesn't really have a rock kind of voice.  With trepidation, I played the first song...and was pleasantly surprised.This album IS different than his previous outings, but that's not a bad thing. The songs don't have that \"over-produced\" sound, with lots of vocal reverb and bounding orchestrations and vocals in the background.  Many of these songs are just Josh, a piano, and the occasional subtle violin or guitar in the background. No backing vocals, no blazing productions, just Josh, and his amazing voice. You can even hear the slight imperfections in his voice, and even though subtle, provide for a very real experience by a very talented individual.Josh wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on this album, thus why most are in english. But the non-english songs are fantastic! Very flowy, musical, and very, very good. There actually isn't a single bad song on this album, but highlights include \"Hidden Away\", \"Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourquoi\", \"Bells of New York City\", and the phenomenal \"Higher Window\", which was so good it may make you cry.I highly recommend this album!\n", "val": 0.027529021725058556}

{"text": "\"Illuminations\" is a departure for Josh Groban. The producer here is Rick Rubin, who is generally winning Grammys for producing albums for Jay-Z, AC-DC, the Dixie Chicks, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Adele, and Justin Timberlake. Groban, known for the lush arrangements of former producer David Foster, and Rubin wouldn't be anyone's first choice for a collaboration.But they did collaborate. It took them several years to produce the album. Groban co-wrote eleven of the tracks with Rubin's encouragement and criticism. As such, the songs are, of course, more personal, more reflective.This is the album that many Groban fans dislike. It is very different from the earlier work, but for me it's all to the good. The first two albums sound as though an older opera divo couldn't make the recording sessions and they dragged in poor Josh Groban to replace him. Actually, David Foster has admitted that much of the material and arrangements early on were intended for Andrea Bocelli. It makes sense. How else would a 22 year old get saddled with \"Broken Vow,\" a song about a long-term marriage breaking up?His voice was gorgeous and as close to technical perfection as you'll find on any pop album, but it just wasn't Groban, the  funny, attractively nerdy, overthinking guy who showed up in interviews and dropping f bombs in Jimmy Kimmel skits. \"Illuminations\" is the album that seems closer to the real guy.It's a different voice, still gorgeous, but more mature, taking more risks. If you come for \"America's choirboy,\" forget buying this one. This is Groban experimenting. There's not another, \"You Raise Me Up\" on here, which is okay by me.Rick Rubin wanted this to be the Josh Groban album that people who weren't fans bought. I don't think \"Illuminations\" is that, but it is intelligently crafted and there are some beautiful songs. Especially poignant is \"Au Jardin Des Sans Pourquoi,\" written with Rufus Wainwright and his mother, Kate McGarrigle, just before her death.Other highlights are \"Higher Window,\" a romantic ballad, and \"Wandering Kind,\" a short instrumental piece that serves as an introduction to the album, written when Groban was twelve. That one is significant because, well...twelve, for goodness sakes, and who else but Rick Rubin would have the nerve to start a Josh Groban album, an album for a guy known for his magnificent voice, with a song where he's just playing the piano?Actually, this is my favorite Groban album, even in comparison to what came before and what was recorded later. It sounds more authentic, for lack of a better word. It's in my regular rotation, which is my highest compliment.\n", "val": 0.0051171681843698025}

I was hooked!Ever since the day when 17-year-old Josh Groban sang in public for the first time, he's continued to amaze with his gifted voice.Since then he's sold over 27 MILLION albums, all of his albums went Multi-Platinum.If you're still debating whether-or-not to buy his albums, go listen to samples of his songs on amazon/itunes, and you'll be hooked, just like I was.(Songs I highly recommend trying out first are February Song, When You Say You Love Me, Si Volvieras a Mi, My Confession, Bells of New York City, Happy In My Heartache, You Are Loved (Don't Give Up), Love Only Knows, Awake, Below The Line.)He also made an awesome Christmas album, by the way. :)\n", "val": 0.04027210548520088}

For Illuminations, Groban switched record labels and found a new producer. And unlike his first four albums, nearly all of the songs on the album are co-written by Groban. The result is an album that feels much more personal than some of his previous work. I personally have always loved the songs that are written by Groban himself; he has a particular talent for beautiful piano melodies. Nowhere is this more evident than Bells of New York City, Hidden Away, and Higher Window. Au Jardin des sans Pourquoi and Voce Existe En Mim also add to the pantheon of Groban's foreign language songs. All in all, a spectacular new effort.\n", "val": 0.010973266325891018}

{"text": "Josh Groban's album Illuminations is a true treasure. Others have said that Josh's higher register was laughable; I say the contrary. His voice, in its entirety is beautiful. His high notes are as clear and as dulcet as his lower ones. Yes, this album is a departure from his earlier ones, but that doesn't make it bad.  It makes it different. I adore it. The songs are lovely, and the album as a whole tells a story. There is a vein of melancholy sadness that runs through it; a thread of love lost and longing. The lyrics are beautiful, like:Love Only Knows: Love only knowsIf we'll give into fear and choose life under coverShe said love only knows if it's special enough than we'll choose one anotherLove only knows, how your arms pull me in like the tide pulls me underShe said love only knows just how long we can run before we lose each otherAnd we need each otherThe Bells of New York: Sing to me one song for joy and one for redemptionAnd whatever is in between that I call mineWith the street lamp light to illuminate the grayAnd the bells of New York City calling me to stayGalileo(Someone Like You): Who puts the rainbow in the sky?Who lights the stars at night?Who dreamt up someone so divine?Someone like you and made them mine  As for listing favorites; I can honestly say that it's impossible. The songs are all beautiful in their own ways. I could have sat here and gladly typed all the lyrics for every song; they're all so beautiful.  I have written this wordy review in defense of this album. It is worth purchasing. And it is wonderful.\n", "val": 0.032272081822156906}

In fact, I don't know if I will listen to it more than once. It will be a shame and, to me, a tragedy if this is the direction Josh takes from now on.

{"text": "This CD is different, and may not be what you're expecting from Josh Groban if you're familiar with his debut CD, Closer, and Awake. It is less bombastic, with simpler orchestral arrangements on some songs. It took me a few listens to really settle in to the music and begin to understand the album as a whole. It's slower, and a little melancholy, but still very beautiful. The standouts to me are \"The Bells of New York City\",\"If I Walk Away\", and \"Love Only Knows\". The only song that is an outright clunker is Galileo, which now earns a skip every time I come to it. Its lyrics sound as if they were written by a poetic 9 year old.

{"text": "In my opinion, his voice is just too big and full for the pared-down, indie, acoustic-type sound he was going for. It still sounds great, but it's just too overpowering and unbalanced. With a few exceptions, the songs didn't really catch my attention or make an impact like they usually do. For the first time ever with a JG album, I found myself even the first time through wanting to skip multiple songs in a row and forcing myself to give them more of a chance.I became a Josh Groban fan because I really enjoyed the full-orchestrated, powerful songs (I really liked Voce Existe em Mim, War at Home, and L'Ora dell'Addio for that reason). I guess I'm just not into the indie stuff that's big now either, so that may have been a factor.Josh is a great lyricist and I'm excited about his next album. I can't fault him for trying to go in a new direction and I feel bad criticizing something he's described as meaning a lot to him, because you can tell his heart was in it. But overall for me, Illuminations was just kind of bland and boring and I probably wouldn't have bought more than a few songs had I not already pre-ordered.

Yes, it's quite different. But if you're truly a fan, go into this one with open ears and an open mind.The more I listen to this album, the more I love it. My favorite song on this album changes all the time. I immediately loved \"voce existe em mim\" and felt it had a lot of the same \"bigness\" as many of the number 1 tracks on previous albums, yet had a totally different kind of sound. \"Bells of New York\" came in close second and took over the number one spot on my list for awhile (as I said, it keeps changing!) I'm currently enamored with \"Wandering Kind\" even though he doesn't actually sing that song. To think he wrote that at twelve years old is astounding!My point is, especially for you die hard Grobanites out there, give this album time to digest. Really listen and listen again.

I continued to listen to the WORDS as well as the music, and I am fully in love with this album.  So much so that I have not put on the other albums.  The only song I can't really wrap my head around is the last one on the album.  Other than that, I feel that this album is giving us Josh Groban's heart -- not David Foster.  #7 - \"just don't tell me that it's too late for me to love you\".  This album is beautiful!!!

{"text": "On this CD Josh Groban opens his heart with soaring vocals over majestic musical tracks.  The variety in the numbers is fascinating, making me wish I just knew more of the back story on some of the lyrics.  It doesn't get any more personal than this.  Being a singer of more than one language myself, I appreciate the originality, variety, and vulnerability shown on this album.  To those who don't appreciate the variety, this album seems to represent life with all of its ups and downs, including bittersweet moments, memories, and yearnings.  There are inspiring numbers, some larger than life showing great vision and an inspiring message, while other numbers are intensely personal. Having discovered Josh's music only a few years ago, I can easily appreciate the new vocal and lyrical challenges he now shares with all of us.  The falsetto is awesome, and even after listening to the CD a number of times, I look forward to the vocal range between warm deep notes and the falsetto punctuations with anticipation every time.

I was not too happy that I went and bought the cd, but I don't think I am necessarily going to return it either. I am just going to give Josh a break, he's still the same Josh that makes wonderful music, that we all love.He's basically just trying something new.I have learned from a few voice lessons, and other research that you need, to try several different styles of music. To successfully find your own unique voice.Maybe, that it possibly what Josh is doing, who knows.Just please cut him some slack and support him.Everyone goes through changes and experimenting, to become uniquely them, whether it is music or something else.I know I am. Hidden Away, and Higher Window were my favorites.  Hopefully, we can get the best of both worlds classical and contemporary with his next album,.I think it seems cool and sober, but underneath it is very human, and sincere. Like a conversation you would share with someone you really trust, which would feel warm. I am not a total Josh Groban fan like a Grobanite, no offense to you all that are Grobanites.

That is sadly the case with nothing but gibberish from her voice. Her latest song, Blow, the second single from the wasted Cannibal, is absolutely worse than her last song We R Who We R. I really was absolutely not impressed with the song. It just was a waste of time, and Ke$ha is truthfully a real waste of a good artist. She really needs to grow up and find better songs to call her own. Her love is really just drugs and not good music.Song: D\n", "val": 1.3373139154282399e-05}

{"text": "Actually, no... Ke$ha doesn't blow.At all.Following-up \"We R Who We R,\" Ke$ha re-releases \"Blow\" (the title here was the original lead-off single for Cannibal, but \"peaked\" at #97 on Billboard's Hot 100 before vanishing into thin air). Blow feels exactly correct here as the follow-up single behind R; the video (already done) is in-place across cable TV-land (and has been for some time), while re-mixes & ringtones have long been available (from the prior earlier release) -- it just seems correct to not let all of that in-place effort go to waste before breaking \"Sleazy\" (or whatever the next single might be from Cannibal) across radio.Blow strikes me as a bit less than a finished product; the track feels demo-like with a cut & paste chorus, although the production & vibe certainly feel acceptable as-is. The single is a bit darker in tone, lyrically; Ke$ha speak-sings that she (and her pals, apparently) are, ...taking control/pretty and sick/young and bored... we get what we want/we do what you don't. It's noteworthy that after 5 Top 10 singles in a year, Ke$ha's voice still sounds new and refreshing.Vocally, Ke$ha here stays in safe-range; the in-chorus hook strikes me as actual yodeling (!); I can't recall actual yodeling being used in a mass-market single, ever. This, alone, gives the record a certain stamp of uniqueness, although it does wear thin after a few listens. Getting back to my earlier point about the track feeling demo-like (Ke$ha seems to PREFER tacky, cheap, and cringe-worthy effects, and uses them ON PURPOSE; some of Ke$ha's effects sound as if they might have come straight out of a 1980's video game); I do think this could have re-mixed into much more of a lasting ear-worm. I suspect that Ke$ha simply had the stuttering ooo-ooo-oooh on file from some earlier piece, and simply built Blow around it after realizing that she had a wonderful stand-alone hook (kind of like Hollywood building major films around some new special effect) -- which doesn't mean that such efforts don't work, of course: indeed, they absolutely DO. It's just that songs like this don't get \"written,\" in the usual sense: they are ASSEMBLED, and Blow, unfortunately, has exactly that sort of sound, which it didn't need to have. This could have been done as a blast of originality; a freight train of onrushing goofiness. Instead, well... it was left to Blow.Still, the grasp of songwriting as craft here is on full display, and I have no doubt that Ke$ha lands another Top 10 SKU here with an extremely radio (and club) friendly unit. It's another solid (but safe) effort, worthy of 3 stars, although just barely -- and that's not meant as \"real\" crit, by the way: I do understand that as a new artist, Ke$ha is still grinding, still \"attacking the belt.\" By the time we get to her 2nd or 3rd album, however -- when she gets to the point where she can do whatever she really wants no matter who likes it or doesn't like it -- I have a feeling that Blow-like tracks will be much more goofily sophisticated & experimental-sounding... Ke$ha is hinting at her future sound here, and it's very cool. Tracks like Blow feel almost designed to make you feel young or old.Man... I wish that Ke$ha had never put that stupid Dollar $ign in her monniker.It seemingly announces, in advance, that she's a cultural irritant not to be taken seriously -- while the reality is that Ke$ha is one of the brightest bulbs in the box. It takes an absolute TON of intelligence to make pop this sharp, smart, and plain ol' damn good to sound so vapid, shallow, and dumb.3 stars.Ke$ha: more, please.\n", "val": 0.001996552338823676}

{"text": "This was not purchased through Amazon, it was a gift from my nephewI have been a fan of Josh Groban since the first time I saw him open his mouth and stun me with his magnificent voice. I have all his CDs except the Christmas one, and have been to his concerts on several occasions (one front row experience). This young man, in my opinion, has a rare gift. Having said that, I found the Illuminations album rather flat and somewhat dark. Not to say that there weren't some good offerings, perhaps his new direction is just not my personal style. I would recommend sampling some of the songs before purchasing so that you can hear and decide for yourself.There were many negative reviews for his Awake CD when it first appeared, although mine was a positive one; I loved the variety and the new side of Josh's personality and choices. Others said it was \"different\", not Josh's \"usual\", but I think many fans came to appreciate it and I'm sure new fans were made from its release.  Perhaps I'll warm up to Illuminations (however, I don't truly think that will be the case as a whole--rather than having an entire CD of favorites, I may settle for 2 or 3). On the up side, Illuminations may bring in a fan base that has been missing in the past.

{"text": "3.5/5 starsEven though I was late to the Josh Groban crowd (late 2007 and onward), he quickly became my favorite artist of all time (granted, I'm rather narrow-minded in my musical tastes, but I'm venturing out a bit more). I listened to him all the time when driving. When I heard that a new Josh Groban album was going to come out in late 2010, I was overjoyed. I was even more thrilled when a video of his WIP \"Voce Existe Em Mim\" came out, and I listened to it over and over because I was eager to hear new material from Groban. Finally, the time drew near for Illuminatons' release, and the singles started coming out.\"Hidden Away\" was our first full-blown glimpse into what was to become Illuminations. I liked the song, but I was a bit perplexed by it. It was short (a little less than four minutes), the tune was very simplistic (two verses and two choruses that sounded the same, no key-change or bridge, really simple chords, etc), and something was different about Josh Groban's voice. He went off-pitch quite a bit, and he didn't hit a single note above E-natural in full voice - all the high notes were in falsetto. Sure, it was pretty, but I'm used to him being a baritone with an upper extension and letting the high notes soar. What's the deal with not hitting the high A in full voice? And why the pitch problems? As much as I enjoyed the new piece, it seemed to me like it should be a WIP, not a final cut. I was a bit sad that it didn't seem as developed as some previous ones.Then, out came Voce Existe Em Mim. Finally, the Brazilian song had been released! I was so enchanted by the song that - no joke - it was the only song I listened to for two days straight. Going to school, going to work, driving home, I always listened to it. Hearing Josh Groban sing in Portuguese while being accompanied by hauntingly-beautiful strings and epic-sound drums was captivating, and I still listen to the song to this day.After that came Higher Window. It was a pretty song, but at least there was more to it than Hidden Away. It still seemed a bit simplistic and toned-down for an epic voice like Josh Groban. It was a good song overall, however.Finally came L'Ora Dell'Addio. I liked it, and I was glad to hear Josh singing in Italian again, but it suffered from a similar problem to Hidden Away and Higher Window - too simplistic, too short, and at the end I found myself thinking, \"That's it?\" I began to feel a bit anxious about the album - were all the songs going to be this short and toned down?A few days before the album was actually released, Josh Groban's Facebook page allowed people to stream the various songs, so I listened to the album all the way through (though I tended to skip the singles, which I had played to death). I enjoyed the pieces, and my impressions are below.The Wandering Kind - a very pleasant and magical-sounding piece of music by Josh Groban. I think so much of it that I have even taught myself to play it by ear on the piano. It's certainly a nice intro, but... it's so short. Why couldn't Josh Groban have at least made it three-and-a-half to four minutes long? 2 minutes 30-something seconds isn't bad for a \"prelude,\" but when it's a 13-track CD, I don't want a bunch of less-than-three-minute pieces! Not to mention, I would have liked to hear more playing from Josh and his team.Bells of New York City - a chilling and atmospheric song which I very much enjoy, though it is also rather simplistic. Still, it's nice listening for when I'm close to home and don't have time for Voce Existe Em Mim.Galileo - this song, I enjoyed, but I don't listen to it much. I'm not really too fond of the lyrics, as they are rather cheesy. The first verse is decent (although how is Galileo a \"Galileian\" boy? He's not from Galilee in the Holy Land!), but the second one sounds like it was written by some amateur. Maybe I'll give this one another twirl.Now skipping L'Ora Dell'Addio and Hidden Away, we get to...Au Jardin des Sans-Pourquoi - although I liked this piece, the tune was rather... lacking. It sounded like Josh Groban was just singing in an up-and-down fashion in his range, and it doesn't evolve much. Plus, I'm not too fond of French, so that doesn't help much either.Skipping Higher Window, we come to...If I Walk Away - although I like this song, it is also too simplistic for my tastes. It might have to do with the \"stripping away\" that Rick Rubin and Josh Groban have done. I can't really say much, except that I like this piece, but I don't go back to it very often.Love Only Knows - now this one, I was simply enchanted by. Even though it's rather strange for Josh Groban to start in falsetto on the first notes of the verses, I was captured by the beauty of this song and its lyrics. I listened to it quite often at the beginning, and I still enjoy it whenever I play it from time to time.I've already talked about Voce Existe Em Mim, so I'll just talk about...War at Home - I thought this was a weird song at first, but now I love it, and I find its lyrics very meaningful. If I had a better voice, I would definitely cover it and set it to some photos/footage of our soldiers, but right now that's just a dream. Even though I don't listen to this one as often as Voce Existe Em Mim, I still think of it quite often.London Hymn - this one was sort of bittersweet. My main complaint is similar to The Wandering Kind - even though I like the little bite-size they gave us, they should have expanded on it. Now I know that you're thinking, \"But this flows into the last track!\" Well, that's true, I still think they should have done something more with this song. Having a full-length Josh Groban song with a melancholic tune and a choir in the background would have been a great step in a different direction. Instead, they just gave us less than two minutes of listening time. I like the song, but it was an afterthought - even when Josh Groban talks about it, he mentions how he asked the producers if \"there would be room on the album for...\" a little extra thing, which turned out to be London Hymn. I hope they do something like this in the next album, but more developed.Straight To You - the final track in the album, and probably the only cover (unless you got the special edition). It's a swell piece overall, but it's just the same melody repeating over and over, and Josh Groban doesn't even explore his high range much. I wouldn't say this piece was half-baked or anything, but it just didn't resonate with me so much.Overall, I liked the album, but it just wasn't 5-star material. The songs themselves weren't all phenomenal, and Josh Groban himself... well, I'll be frank. I think his voice is slowly deteriorating. This is probably where many of the readers will start attacking me, but I really don't care about having a mud-slinging contest with crazed fans. If your opinion differs from mine, then please state your thoughts intelligently and clearly without giving me any of this \"Josh is amazing\" or \"I'd like to hear YOU sing\" rubbish. Anyway, back to the subject. While listening to the album and to Josh Groban singing in a live setting, I have noticed some vocal problems that are hampering him and making him sound worse over time. His voice doesn't have the clear, silky quality it used to have. You could say that he has gotten older and maybe his voice has deepened, but I think the problem is technical, not physiological. His high notes sound very strained (especially above F#), his larynx position is unstable, he sings many notes in falsetto which he used to sing in full-voice, and sometimes he sounds just plain bad. I have to respectfully disagree with the people who say that Josh Groban has \"gotten better.\" He may sound better to you because you like the newer sound, but I can just hear that he's using improper technique, and it's definitely encumbering him.Pop singers don't always have to worry about using optimal vocal technique, and many of them get away with it and sound great. The problem here is that while Josh Groban isn't a classical singer who has to sing over an orchestra (without a microphone) several times a week, the style he sings requires an easy high range, a full-sounding-yet-silky voice, and a pleasant tone overall. Unfortunately, he doesn't sound as \"perfect\" as he once did. I hope that he gets on the right track and sounds better than ever in his next release (whenever it may come about).So to sum it up, I like the album, but the direction the songs have taken doesn't always work, and Josh Groban himself isn't singing as phenomenally as he once did. I hope his next album is better. Meanwhile, I'm gonna keep on listening to this and other Josh Groban albums while speculating on what he's going to put out next.\n", "val": 0.0005538433906622231}

I wanted to see what he could really do when not partnering with David Foster (directly or indirectly...but with the same \"Foster\" sound).  Groban still has a great voice no doubt but this album brings him back down to earth.  As someone who has done a decent amount of studio recording myself you just had to wonder if he was a vocal god or just a really really good singer where the studio production boosted his sound (particularly at mid-levels imho).  This album seems to answer that pretty clearly: Groban is great...but Foster made him a god.Kudos to Josh for sticking himself out there and not relying so much on production value this time around.  Already looking forward to what's next.\n", "val": 0.02509956993162632}
{"text": "I have never written a review before, so after reading a number of these, I wanted to throw in my thoughts.  I can't say I had known much of anything about Josh Groban other than to say I knew of a few of his songs (You Raise Me Up, Songs from Ally McBeal).  Only recently, have I delved into this magnificent artist's music. That was after I heard the song, \"You are Loved\" in my son's i-Pod and watched Josh's stirring and heartfelt performance in Washington DC on the Fourth of July.  Truly, this young man stands alone; his voice is mesmerizing!  As I began checking out Groban songs on You-Tube, I discovered the ones I favored most were those in which he had a hand in writing/composing.  There are several layers to these songs.  As you begin to peel away, you are impacted mentally, emotionally and spiritually.  Groban's \"Illuminations\" songs fill my i-Pod, and I listen to them over and over again. Perhaps that is because I feel like I am getting to know the unique person who is behind that glorious Voice.  Josh must be doing something right.  After all, my 15 year-old football player son blasts \"Higher Window\" throughout the house!  We are looking forward to attending his Straight to You Tour later this year.\n", "val": 0.03113490715622902}

The songs might have been utterly beautiful if sung in Italian, a language I enjoy listening to but have no ability to translate, and would have been blissfully unaware of the absurdity. And doesn't everything sound better sung in Italian, especially by Josh Groban. Sorry to say, but I only play this CD in the car when I want some comic relief and a good laugh. Doesn't make me love Groban any less. As the cliche goes, he could sing the telephone book and I'd probably enjoy it.

{"text": "I have never written a review on Amazon before but I felt compelled after reading some of the reviews of Josh Groban's Illuminations.I have admittedly come late to the party when it comes to Josh Groban.  I have always admired him as being a truly gifted singer.  I remember seeing him on Ally McBeal, LOVED him in Chess (that's where he really started to win me over.) and have enjoyed his performances on PBS, etc.  But he really won me over when I finally saw him when the Straight To You Tour came to Raleigh.  I knew the voice would blow me away but I was not prepared for how funny, witty, charming and fun he would be. I loved the concert and would go see him again in a heartbeat.I was also late to the party when it comes to buying his CDs.  But after seeing him live, I  bought Closer, Awake and Illuminations.  And Illuminaitons is actually my favorite of the three.  I have listened to Closer once or twice.  I love some of the songs (like You Raise Me Up), and while I appreciate his talent it's just a bit over-produced for me.I do admit that some songs on Illuminations took a couple of listens to click for me and some I do occasionally skip over (hence the 4 stars)...like Au Jardin Des Sans-puorquoi and Galileo.  But I cannot stop listening to Voce Existe Em Mim or L'ora Dell Addio.  For me, Voce is the strongest song on the album and really a departure for him.  The drum sections are addicting, they go perfectly with the melody.  I love the change of tempo in the middle of the song and how the last part then speeds up.  And I love to hear him sing in Portuguese.  I think the orchestration is wonderful in this song...love the violins.  When I play the CD in my car, I start with this song, listen all the way through and then go back to it. I can't get enough of it.And what can I say about the vocals in L'ora Dell Addio except that they are exquisite.  I think that vocally it is the best track on the album.  It moves me every single time I listen to it and that one note that he hits midway through the song never ceases to amaze me.I'm also impressed that Josh wrote a lot of the songs on this album.  Maybe he does need work as a songwriter but I think that this is very admirable for a real first attempt.  It's not easy to put yourself out there in that way.  I love Hidden Away and Higher Window.  I think the melodies are strong in both songs and I actually really like the lyrics.  And I love the message in If I walk away and how it builds at the end.  I know some are not fans of the falsetto but I think it works.  And I admire the fact that he's taking chances and exploring different aspects of his singing.  We all know he can hit the glory notes and has such a deep, rich sound but maybe he feels the need to explore other parts of his range.  I think the part in Hidden Away when he sings, \"Sing it out so I can finally breathe in...\" and he goes from his head voice to his chest voice is glorious.The two songs that have grown on me are Bells of New York City and Straight To You.  You can really tell how personal Bells is to him having just moved to NYC.  I love the flute and how the chords he's chosen actually sound like bells.  And Straight To You has become one of my favorites.  Everything from the orchestration to the vocals is just beautiful.  I think more than any song on the album you can feel the emotion when he sings.  And I love the lyrics.I also love that this album really puts Josh's voice front and center.  I have heard many albums where the singer is over-powered by the instruments.  But on this album his voice is clearly in the forefront.  I like that the orchestration is stark in some cases and not overdone because his voice is what shines through.So, that's my take on it.  As I said, I have never written a review before.  But I'm really enjoying this album and wanted to post my feeling about it.  This is obviously a departure for Josh and I say good for him for following his heart.  He'll never please all the critics or all the fans but at least he's being true to himself and maybe he'll pick up some new fans along the way.  Like me. :-)\n", "val": 0.05345242843031883}

While the arrangements certainly are not stark or overly lean, Groban's voice is allowed to shine through first and foremost unlike in his previous offerings.  And voice is what this man is all about.

I am a karaoke junkie and usually have several songs I love to sing, but this album produced 1 song that I'm only slightly interest in (albeit the first song is an instrumental).Every song is beautifully done, which I have come to expect from Josh's albums, but most aren't distinctive and don't rise to the level of songs from his other albums.

{"text": "The newest CD \"Illuminations\" is a break from tradition for Josh Groban, in that he stepped out of his comfort zone, with Rick Rubin. Rick pushed Josh to write 11 of the 13 songs, making this album the truest, most definitive Josh, we have ever seen or heard. The emotion, arrangements, power and sincerity of each song, stirs the heart and moves the soul of the listener.

{"text": "I was going to start off this review with a quote of the lyrics from my favorite song on the album, but I couldn't choose one. My favorite depends on the mood I'm in when I listen.The Wandering Kind - instrumental, and very lovely. Upbeat and hopeful-sounding.Bells of New York City - beautifully haunting. I can feel myself there, seeing and hearing what his words describe.Galileo - I have to admit, I'm not hugely thrilled with this one. I think the concept is great, and his singing is wonderful. The end of the song is lovely. It just feels choppy and disjointed to me, and I find the lyrics in parts hard to take seriously. That said, it's hard not to sing along with it, and the end of the song makes up for any awkwardness in the rest of it.L'Ora Dell'Addio - gentle and almost operatic, the perfect showcase for his perfect voice.Hidden Away - very different. I love the chorus and the way his voice almost seems to be at play. A heartwarming message to the lyrics.Au Jardin des Sans-Pourquoi - again, just lovely. I feel like I'm soaring when I listen to this one.Higher Window - Touching and sad, almost desperate.If I Walk Away -  Catchy music to go with lyrics I can really relate to. It feels very... Human.Love Only Knows - beautiful. This song just pulls me in, with the hopefulness and uncertainty of love clear in every word and note.Voce Existe Em Mim - this has to be one of the coolest songs on any of his albums. The beat is amazing, and the music sets off the sound of his voice in absolutely fascinating ways. I like to turn the volume up high and let this one take me on its journey.War at Home - deeply moving. It makes me want to take someone's hand and hold on tight.London Hymn - absolutely gorgeous! His voice blends with the chorus in an almost classical-sounding piece. Far too short. I could listen to a whole album of just this kind of song.Straight to You - I'm not even sure how to describe this one except to say that it gives me the chills. The harmonies of the singers in the background, the gentle yet almost fierce feel of it, all second to the chilling lyrics and the images and feelings they provoke.This is easily his best album yet. His voice has amazing warmth and depth to it, quite literally awe-inspiring in places. The music is breathtaking in its beauty, especially some of the harmonies both vocal and instrumental.

I do think it would make an amazing voice training CD.  In fact there is a musical transcription of this CD scheduled to come out approximately April 1.

To clarify something; when I say `rebuttal', I am not saying that those who make themselves fans of his are to like everything that he contrives; no, not at all.

However, not much of a reason is given why it is trash, except that it is not like his other pop opera albums (which David Foster produced). To all who call themselves `fans' and who have made such reviews, I would like to say to you that I find that your reviews should be honestly reconsidered. I also would like to suggest that you drop the term `fan' as it is short for fanatic.I will say for myself that I found this album to be, for the most part, a gentle fresh breeze. I felt that Josh's music had peaked to a somewhat stagnant offering with Awake, with the exception of \"You Are Loved\" and \"February Song\".  In the past albums there was a fairly heavy reliance on synthesizers, but in this album it is almost completely orchestrated with traditional instruments. \"Love Only Knows\" is the exception, with an arrangement that mixed synthesizer with traditional instrumentation for a nice quality touch. In his last album, Awake, his singing sounded rather distant. In this album, his singing is more passionate and soulful and sounds like it is coming more from his heart. While in all of his past albums he did not play a significant role in the musical composition or lyric writing.. However, in this album his contributions are significant, writing the lyrics for six of thirteen songs, and contributing to the musical composition in eleven of thirteen songs. Of course, this is a significant improvement. The lyrics in this album, like his past albums, communicate a much deeper meaning than the majority of vague, sexual oriented trash played on the radio. On the other hand, regarding this album, some of his songs seem to either lack polish or luster. The songs \"Higher Window\" and \"L'ora Dell'addio\" (a Latin song), fit in the lackluster category while \"Voce Existed Me Mime\" fits more in the lacking polish category because it sounds at peak periods  in the music like the musicians became a little too enthused and tried to outperform each other or Josh.No doubt there are more critiques that could be pointed out, especially if you have a vendetta against this album.  I personally have enjoyed it and am glad that Josh has taken a different direction compared to his previous albums (excluding Noel). Does it have a folksy edge? To a certain and varying degree, yes, but I don't think that that is a negative. It is something different, and I think that that is a good thing. I think it is also a smart move to get out of the competitive pop-opera genre and create his own musical niche. One of the things I don't understand regarding the album is why so many of his fans are angry, except that the album is a partial departure from the style of music that they were used to. This album has given us an opportunity to get a more up close and personal look at Josh Groban, as a person and artist. The real question is whether you like Josh Groban, realizing that his music will reflect him as a person. If you are an admirer of his music, shouldn't you want to learn more about him through his music, to hear him express himself as an artist? Once again, I am not saying that his works should be hailed as perfect; no flipping way! Reasonably criticize his work; just recognize that you will be seeing more of Josh Groban in this album.Whether you are new to Josh Groban's music, or have followed his music from a past album up to present, I suggest that you first take it out of your local library, if that is a possibility, so you can decide if you like it before you spend money for this album.With that, this review comes to an end.-Jake Smithers\n", "val": 0.0004976565833203495}

{"text": "I have to start out by saying that I've been a Josh fan from the beginning. I went to his shows before he needed an opening act! I'm saying this because, while I'm a huge fan, I'm not going to gush simply because Josh released another album. I'm going to be honest. I am highly disappointed in Illuminations. The first time I listened to it all the way through, my reaction was a resounding, \"Meh.\" I didn't have a desire to listen to it again for weeks, and there wasn't one song that stuck in my mind, or that I found myself humming afterward. \"Voce Existe Em Mim\" is the obvious standout. Other than that, the album is unimpressive. Many songs sound like Sondheim rejects. The rest sound like he's sitting in a smoky French caf singing unconvincingly about lost love. The album is devoid of Josh's usual passion. I feel like the album was overproduced, and that Josh was holding back for whatever reason. Even his high notes sound strained. (His falsetto, however, is fantastic as always.) Was he going for artsy? theater? If so, I'm disappointed in the number of songs he \"talk-sings.\" (Just get to the melody already, Josh! Oh... there isn't one?) Josh is touring in my city this summer, and I don't think I want to spend the money to hear an album I don't like, as big a fan as I am. I'll save up for the next album and tour... hopefully they will be worth it.\n", "val": 7.798248407198116e-05}

I had just bought the CD and was on a 4 hour drive so I turned it on and was instantly curious.  I was used to the style he has delivered in all of his other albums but this was different, more soulful and meaningful. When I reached track 11 I started to cry (not good when driving)as my son had just returned from bootcamp! What an amazing and beautiful song, The War At Home is a wonderful dedication to all those men and women and their families who serve here and abroad, not only the military but the police and fire fighters.The rest of the album is a sign that Josh is growing as a artist and trying new songs and differnt avenues of delivery.  It's funny to me that people have been so critical of this album, when a artist wants to branch out and try something different it should be encouraged because there may be something more wonderful to come.  Josh is an amazing talent and should be able to try different types/styles of songs, I believe his true fans will really like this album.\n", "val": 0.0381074957549572}

I don't care what the critics might say about him. Critics are like some teachers who exemplify the old adage, \"If you can't DO, Teach\" - bitter people with some axe to grind.

What continues to appeal to me about Josh is his choice of music which I find very brooding and his voice which is not only beautiful but also has a very soulful quality.  This cd is no exception.After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't sure about about buying this cd, but fortunately I understand that reviews generally reflect preferences, not fact.  I ordered it and have listened to nothing else since it arrived.  I love all the songs on this cd and appreciate each one on it's own; they are so unique and he approaches each one differently.  His voice is as beautiful and soulful as ever but in these songs there is a very appealling raw quality to his sound which only adds to the emotion and meaning.  For me, there are no negatives regarding this cd - music selection, singing, production.  But then, I really hate Wagner's Ring Cycle; and even though I know that there are thousands of people who will cross a continent, even an ocean to see a production of it, I still hate it.

I don't know how many times I have listened to \"Bells of New York City\" and \"Higher Window\".  They are 2 of my favorites, but I like them all. When he sings \"follow me\" on \"If I Walk Away\", you want to say, \"Go on, follow him\".  JG has grown as an artist, but more importantly, as a person.  He is believable when he sings about missed chances and lost love.  He has such a great voice that it doesn't need to be propped up by the lavish accompaniment found on his earlier CD's.  I loved them as well, but like to hear his voice stripped down like this.  I admit I don't quite see why some folks are not happy with this offering.  If you like his voice, it's still here.

Previous albums were filled with beautifully written music (with a couple minor exceptions) with rich orchestrations and interesting harmonic progressions.  They made great use of his talent by staying in his range and showcasing the amazing voice he has.The music in Illuminations is sophomoric.  The harmonic progressions are lame, the orchestrations thin, and the weak melodies take him outside of his range in several notable cases, causing him to strain his voice painfully (to the listener, at least).

{"text": "I was never a huge Josh Groban fan, not being one for soaring violins, but I keep coming back because of his extraordinary voice. This album lets his voice really shine. The soaring violins are still there on some tracks, and some of the lyrics are a little simplistic, but they're never shallow. Actually, I've found that the more I listen to this album, the more I appreciate the simple but heartfelt explorations of love.As for the songs, the gorgeous Voce Existe Em Mim--one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard--is worth the price of the album by itself. The instrumentation, which features a wonderful Brazilian drumbeat, is nearly as stirring as the vocals. Other highlights for me include HIdden Away, Higher Window, If I Walk Away, and the lovely Bells of New York City. The melodies on this album are uniformly beautiful, the lyrics are moving, and the lack of overpowering instrumentation only adds to the depth of listening pleasure.Although I enjoyed this album from the get-go, I like it more and more with each hearing. I urge those of you who were disappointed because of the departure from Groban's earlier style to give it another try. These are songs that not only stand up well, but improve, over time.\n", "val": 0.04100063070654869}
{"text": "I first discovered Josh Groban many years ago when I connected the young man with the booming voice that resonated out of my radio. I was astonished at his talent, and the beauty of his songs. I have collected all of his works, many of them in concert, and even had the glorious experience of first being introduced to \"My December\" (in my personal opinion, one of his prettiest songs) live in concert. I had wondered what happened to him and was glad to hear he had an album coming out... but as time passed and no audio clips went up here or anywhere else (sadly, I did not have access to streaming the album as many fans did), my uncertainty grew. As it turns out, my concern was not unwarranted -- I did hear \"Hidden Away\" and enjoyed it, but when I got the album for Christmas, the rest of the tracks filled me with disappointment.I will not critique his talent or complain about the arrangements; I will simply say that this is in a different style, and I'm not a big fan of this particular variety of music. I like dramatic, powerful, deeply emotional songs much more than slower arrangements. Intense debate over this album with friends gave me a perfect way to articulate what I feel is \"wrong\" with this album -- it isn't epic. There are no \"epic\" songs. His other albums had them -- music that swelled out of your stereo and filled you with a feeling of awe or breathlessness, as his voice filled the room. These tracks don't fill the space. They don't show off his voice! They seem quiet, and demure, and to be totally honest, bland. I was bored. Normally, I only skip one or two tracks on his albums that are not to my liking -- but here, I was constantly pushing \"next\" on my first listen-through, and feeling terrible about it. I have listened to it on repeat for days, hoping it would grow on me, but it hasn't. I hoped it would.My advice for potential buyers -- listen to it first. Go down to your local Borders and put it through the sample device, or listen to portions of it on his website. Don't just plunk down your hard-earned cash unless you either a) like that style of music, or b) are going to love anything he does. Because this isn't in his usual style, and it may not suit your tastes.\n", "val": 0.00014008495782036334}

Needless to say, I wasn't a fan straight away, but when 'You Are Loved' came out, I became a diehard  fan, even calling myself a Grobanite.  If  your going to buy a Josh Groban album, I suggest you get 'Closer' it is one of my favorites.  This album however is not. From the subpar performances that Josh has done, to the lackluster album, where notes are forced, and painfull to listen to,  this album lacks in so many ways it isn't even funny. Even his 'Awake' was much better then this.  The album lacks in songwriting, for me, if I don't relate to the lyrics of a song, it doesn't click for me and I don't like it.  None of the lyrics make sence on this album. With 'February Song' that was a hit. None of this songs are hit miterial.  Second of all things cannot be done in just one take. It might sound impressive to most, but not here. There is no emotion, no passion nor feeling when he is  singing at all.  A word of advice Josh, go back to your classical rutes, no more experimenting, it's over. Go back to making music with David Foster, and leave the songwriting up to the experts.  I unfortunately will not be seeing Josh on tour with this album like I have done in the past. I'm hoping that  this is not the future  of many Josh albums to come, because  if it is, I will be getting off the  Josh Groban train.\n", "val": 2.423554178676568e-05}

{"text": "I'm one of THOSE Josh Groban fans. I first heard him sing with Charlotte Church-so I've been there pretty much since the beginning. I went to an internet caf at an ungodly hour in Spain so that I could buy tickets to his \"Awake\" tour the minute they were released.  I have all his albums-I mean ALL of them: not just his studio releases, but his concert albums, his special releases, and those he's done for soundtracks. He could sing the telephone book and I'd love it.Unfortunately, I think him singing the telephone book would be better than this album.I say that because I love J Gro. He's  epic, not just for his heavenly voice, but also because he is a risk-taker. He began with a popera sound, his voice soaring over a full orchestra. Then he branched out in all directions. J Gro has proven that he can play it stripped down (examples: \"You're Still You,\" \"Now or Never,\" \"Awake\") and that he can work with ANYONE (examples: \"February Song\" with Dave Matthews, his cover of Lincoln Park's \"December,\" \"Machine\" with Herbie Hancock, just to name a few). And it has always been absolute magic.This time, he worked with Rick Rubin and stripped things down. And...this time, it just didn't take. I'd be lying if I didn't say that this album is pretty disappointing.The reason why? J Gro's songs are incredibly varied, but they are always held together by his unique, pure, resonant voice. He sings in such a way that no one else on the pop/rock/r&b scene could sing a song the way he does. For the most part, that doesn't happen here.As I've listened to the album (and I did try to give it a chance to grow on me), I've often thought \"I can imagine a number of other artists singing this song.\"There are a couple of exceptions: \"If I Walk Away\" and \"Voce Existe Em Mim\" are the excellent standouts.  The funny thing is, neither of them really fit into the folksy/indie rock feel of this album. The former fits more with the songs on the \"Closer\" album and the latter fits better with the more international feel of the \"Awake\" album. I'll still probably go see him when he goes on tour, because I'm that type of fan (and I think \"Voce Existe Em Mim\" live would be amazing!). But, I'll be honest: this isn't his best work.If you're not the type of J Gro fan that buys everything he releases, I'd say buyer beware. Download the two good songs off itunes or rip it from someone.Let's hope he gets that magic back for the next one.\n", "val": 0.008256001397967339}

{"text": "Josh Groban has always set the bar exceedingly high. His magnificent  voice, gorgeous orchestral arrangements and passionate renditions are without rival on today's music scene.  So, it was with high expectations that I purchased this cd, as all his previous offerings have been stellar.  However, on this cd, he heads in in an entirely different direction, and overall, the result is inconsistent and dissatisfying.On the one hand, his performance on the operatic \"L'ora Dell Addio is impressive.  If you didn't know it was his own music, you would think it was lifted right out of a Puccini opera.  Groban's lyrical melody and phrasing are stunningly beautiful and heartfelt, his vocal technique is better here than on the other song selections, and his emotional connection to the music is an inspiration.  Even if you don't like opera, you have to respect his aritistic excellence.  But, I dislike the production manipulation which was done to remove most of the resonance in his voice. That eliminated so much of its power and splendor and was not appropriate for such an intense operatic setting.  On the other hand, the few other foreign language selections on this cd are not memorable.  There are definite flaws in his vocal technique, especially evident on the brazillian song, where his voice is not properly focused and becomes breathy with almost no tone on the high notes.  I know he receives classical instruction, so it is worrisome to me that after all this time his voice has not improved, and sounds rather worse.  He really needs to go back to classic vocal basics and address these issues if he wants to perserve the exceptional God given gift he has.The majority of the tracks are stylistically much more folk inspired, and while the lyrics are often passionate, poetic and personal, musically, the songs often lack cohesiveness and don't successfully convey the emotional depth of his message nor do they showcase his amazing voice.  One song in particular \"Love Only Knows\" is so structurally disjointed that musically it falls just short of being downright chaotic.  Also, his constant use of falsetto is distracting.  I am not sure if he is intentionally singing in this voice for stylistic reasons or if it is indicative of poor vocal technique which has affected his range. Either way, the overall sound is not pleasing to the ear. His voice sounds strained and labored when singing full voice in his upper range, especially on If I Walk Away. Overall, these new songs simply don't measure up to the caliber of songs like \"Remember when It Rained\", or \"Awake\", both collaborative efforts from his previous Closer and Awake cds respectively.I do commend him, however, for his courage to be genuine and honest.  His willingness to share his own inner truths is refreshing and poignant and gives the listener a much clearer insight into who he is.My advice to potential buyers would be to listen to samples of the music prior to purchase if possible and make your own assessment.  If that isn't possible, be prepared for an entirely different style.  I would have liked to give this cd a higher rating, and had the album had a better balance stylistically, a higher level of songwriting and had he exhibited a more beautiful tone quality reminiscent of his earlier cds, I would have happily done so.  As one of the rare artists who can captivate a listener, drawing them into his music and connecting with them on a deeply emotional level, Groban is in a class by himself.  It's a shame there are so few moments on this album where thatcan truly be experienced.\n", "val": 0.00016874652646947652}

{"text": "I have been a fan of Josh Groban from the moment he stepped on the scene.  His voice is hypnotic and unmatched in quality.  His past albums have reflected his exceptional vocal performance and have been lyrically nothing short of amazing.  With beautiful songs under his belt like, \"You Raise Me Up,\" \"When You Say You Love Me,\" \"You Are Loved,\" and \"So She Dances,\" and tearing it up on the soundtrack of Chess - I couldn't wait to hear more for someone so talented.Needless to say Illuminations was at the top of my Christmas list this year.  When I played this album \"The Wandering Kind\" was a very welcome surprise.  The Celtic charm of this particular piece was unexpected and warmed my heart.  Again, I was anticipating what I would hope to be a great CD.The songs that follow The Wandering Kind are neither bad nor good.  They are melodic and soulful, however they are tired and repetitive.  The songs are like what most high school choir teachers subject their students to performing.  Groban performs them with the charm and charisma with which he approached his previous recordings, yet somehow they fall short.  These songs are predictable in their melody and the repetitive nature of each of them - to be quite frank - irritated me.  I expected better.The most disappointing part of this album is by far the lyrics.  In some tracks it sounds, again, like a high schooler trying to write their own songs or poetry.  \"Galileo (Someone Like You)\" has some of the more unfortunate lyrics:\"Galileo fell in love as a Galilean boyAnd he wondered what in heaven who invented such a joy\"That segment alone is nearly imperceivable.  As I went through each song and listened again and again, I could only come to these same conclusions.It pains me to write an unflattering review of someone I so admire and respect, however, Mr. Groban, I feel as though you missed the mark a tad on this one.  Better luck next time.\n", "val": 0.0001820364996092394}

{"text": "Regardless of the polarizing reviews, this is an interesting more \"modern\" commercial effort, and one that I applaud as a good adventure.  There are times when Groban's voice is in starkly naked form and sounds truly \"honest\" for lack of a better descriptor.  Unfortunately, there are other times when his more classical sound pulls fairly far back into the throat and loses a good deal of beauty and point in the process.  Groban's voice is still readily identifiable and full of the expected color and mannerisms that make it what it is, but there are several moments that needed a retake after some adjusting for vocal placement.  London Hymn in particular is nearly painful to listen to.  Odd choices in diphthong handling in Bells of New York are also a bit off-putting. I am concerned that he seems to be using more and more glottal releases in the classical production and trying to generate a darker tone than his core sound.  There are moments that you can hear studio \"manipulation\" to brighten some of the more oddly produced sounds.  Not a bad album, but rather inconsistent at times.

It borders on the offensive.To others who come here, I imagine it's out of curiosity if you've either never heard Josh or are interested to see what's on the new album. Please make that decision for yourself.  It's hard to tell from a 30 second clip, I know, but this album differs in that it's comprised first of all Josh's stories, and the production is not the stamp of just another Producer, but Rick Rubin who pushes his artists to be who they are, not who he is. So maybe go to a book store, try out the headphones and give it a listen if you have the time.  It's a treasure - an effort that may never be repeated, who knows?  If you're looking for the same grandiose that marked his first albums, don't bother.

{"text": "My daughter and I were fortunate to get tickets to Josh's concert \"Before We Begin\" which was very casual and very entertaining.  He explained that the reason it took so long to produce a new CD was that \"Illuminations\" was something he always wanted to do. He also said that the songs were personal to him, especially the first one which he composed when he was about 11 years old and the one dedicated to our troops after he visited Walter Reed Hospital.  The man is a musical genius and has a great personality. He sings from his heart. So as you listen to this CD please try to keep this in mind and appreciate his talent. Everyone needs a change once in a while.\n", "val": 0.05249625816941261}
{"text": "To keep it simple, Josh has a quirky and random personality.  I believe this album finally suits him.  He is truly a talented musician who could fit anyone's mold, but he chooses to experiment and never conform. Some tracks work, some do not, but I'm sure he loves every single one.If people stop buying his albums, he would join the theater...or a traveling circus...you just never know with him.  That's how he rolls and as a fellow nonconformist, I appreciate that.\n", "val": 0.02591913938522339}
{"text": "I have been following Josh's musical career for many years.  I wish he would come to Ohio for a concert!  Now saying that, I will move on to my review - I was fearful of Illuminations because I am older and do not like change, and knew that Josh's creativity and talent would not keep him continuing with the same sound.  I applaud him for going forth and trying out different sounds, words, music.  For taking the chance to have his music ridiculed, his words laughed at, more power to you, Josh.When I first listened to Illuminations, I knew right a way that this wasn't going to be good-where was my good ole Josh music? his voice? I didn't like this-go back to how you were doing it, Josh.  But then I listened and found myself, for most of the songs, feeling the same passion, the same stirring within my soul. And no, I am not a Grobanite, I am not a member of his fan club, nor do I wear Josh Groban jewlery or clothing.  But, I might, if he would come to Cincinnati.  I hope he doesn't give up on us and some of us have done him for exploring more of his creativity.\n", "val": 0.0009280913509428501}

Why the big change? I can not return this now that it is opened sure would like to. I should have read the reviews before I bought it and then made the dicision.I think it would have been better for his fans to make the change more acceptable by doing some songs from his old style and some from the new.\n", "val": 0.0003066750941798091}
{"text": "If you are expecting this CD to sound like all of Josh's old stuff, then don't bother purchasing it.  If you are open to hearing a refreshing new Josh, with a contemporary flair in genre and sound, then you will not be disappointed.  Take time to process it and you will realize that Josh is growing and reinventing himself, as all artists must do.I think that Josh was opening himself up to a new type of song-writing and new musical challenges, with personal stories hidden inside each song.  He clearly sounds like he is performing each song with body and soul.  And, in many cases he may even bring you to tears (e.g. \"War at Home\").The album is beautiful, emotional and sometimes sad, and I think it is his heart singing.  It is different, but how is a musician supposed to grow and challenge himself if he performs the same music all the time?  I think this album is more of a glimpse at the \"real\" Josh... perhaps the other albums were more David Foster than Josh, and that is why he tried this one with Rick Rubin!As for the falcetto- I do not find it unpleasant.  I think it is a rare singer who can actually sing like that and make it sound beautiful (which I think he has done).Overall, I think this is a new realm of music for Josh, and it was executed near-perfectly.  Like I said, if you are open to a new sound from Josh, you will appreciate it.As an aside, the quality of this disc is amazing... crystal clear!Congrats to Josh for taking that leap and opening his creative talents to new and exciting things.  I am so thrilled to own this CD, and cannot wait for the tour!  I saw him in New Haven in Nov, and he performed some of these songs... there are no words to describe it... it was breathtaking.\n", "val": 0.06649493426084518}

{"text": "I am not a Josh Groban fan, and know him only through television performances and the occasional track popping up on the radio.  A friend let me listen to this album, and to say I was underwhelmed would be a gross understatement.Music critique is not my forte, and like so many, I am fairly relegated to the \"cheap seats\" when it comes to criticism.  So, that caveat in mind, I still found this exercise dreadful, an album crammed chock-full of what could be snarkily termed \"musical stylings.\"  First, Groban seems to be quite a formulaic singer, another prince of the power ballad with soaring but over-long self-indulgent notes and key changes before and after treacly and over-wrought vocal swoops that demonstrate less virtuosity than a cheap effort at engaging an emotional roller-coaster.  In other words, this album was the functional equivalent of marching band \"payoff moments.\"  And the more intimate offerings just sounded plain flat, cold, and even bored.  I could not shake the nagging image of the singer standing in a recording booth with a sour look on his face that just screamed - \"Can we get this over with?\"The gross \"shake your vocal money-maker\" pole-spins aside, the lyrics themselves were soupy, absurdly romantic, and cliched.  Song-writing is clearly not his province, and it seems to me he risks becoming just another Michael Bolton, a very competent musician and song-writer who has, in many ways, been ruined by resorting to a product-driven and hackneyed public persona.I have heard it all before, and done better.  Other reviews indicate that Groban shines on other albums, but I cannot speak to that.  So, if you are contemplating a first purchase, I would definitely look at this young man's other offerings first.  This is not worth the time or the money.  Not at all.No recommendation.\n", "val": 3.24497050314676e-05}

After listening to it, we were so so disappointedon the poor recording quality of this album, the strings on the background sound so much like it's coming from synthesizer not fromthe real instruments and the music is so dull and boring,  Josh's voice is not even relaxed at all.The arrangement on every songs are so simple, most of the songs opened with an simple acoustic guitar and piano, sound very much like a low-budgetrecording product!This is simply not the original Josh we like, it is a new Josh's voice that me and my friends feel very hard to like it.I don't think I will pre-order his next album unless I preview it.\n", "val": 4.777245339937508e-05}

Personally speaking, I understand every artiste's need to take risks at some point in his / her career, and always try my best to support their decisions.However, I do feel that Illuminations is not a strong body of work in many aspects. The songs aren't memorable, the melodies are clumsy at times, and the arrangements do nothing to boost the already shaky material.Saddest of all, Josh's usually soaring vocals fall severely short of the mark, and I don't think it has anything to do with age.I'm still listening to the album repeatedly, hoping it will grow on me slowly, hence the 3-star rating.\n", "val": 4.360318052931689e-05}
{"text": "Prior to seeing some clips at a popular video site of his Awake Live, I only had Josh Groban's \"Closer\" CD, which I have absolutely loved for years. His voice effortlessly (or so it seems) pours across the soul as an ointment across a wound. To see him on a talk show (many years back, and I don't remember which one it was), I was impressed to see the non-flashy performance of a man who simply stood, opened his mouth, and produced something absolutely beautiful without hype or physicality. His \"Closer\" CD was better than his first (I recently got his first CD), and I prefer it to his \"Awake\" CD (but love the DVD's music choices!)... but when it comes to \"Illuminations,\" Josh has grown leaps and bounds, which I didn't know was possible. His voice has become much more refined, and he uses it as a skilled craftsman in this CD. The rhythm each song in \"Illuminations,\" is so different from what's commonly produced in America today-- it's got a motivating undercurrent that inspires. The lyrics to the new songs he has written are also excellent, and show another area of growth in this wonderful musician and singer. I can say, by far, \"Illuminations\" is, in my opinion, his best work yet! From the first song to the last, each song is like medicine and when the CD ends, I find that I want more.For those who are even mildly fans of Mr. Groban, this CD may hold some surprises as his \"tenor\" has become more refined in its detail and quality, he wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on this one, and contributed a huge part to the music composition. I highly recommend this CD no matter what genre preference one holds, because this CD doesn't fit into any of the genre boxes! Truly, he's \"pushing the envelop,\" as they say, musically, lyrically, and vocally.\n", "val": 0.0431629978120327}

{"text": "I've spent a considerable amount of time reading the other reviews here of Josh's latest CD and I'm really not all that surprised to see the wide variance of feelings.  Music does and will always affect everyone in a slightly different way because most of us relate to it on an emotional level.  For me, my lasting reaction to \"Illuminations\" was \"Now we're finally hearing the real Josh Groban!\".  I suspect that has something to do with the fact that he pulled away from David Foster this time around and went in a distinctly different direction.  As much as I have loved every other CD he has created, under David Foster's production I often felt that there were nice moments here and there in each song, but felt like what I was hearing was \"Josh ... The Voice\".  With this latest release, I feel like each song has a beginning, middle, and end. There is a purity and intimacy that I have not felt in his previous CDs.  I think the fact that some of these songs were recorded in one attempt demontrates the conviction Josh and Rick Rubin had in their collaboration.I generally try not to get too much into an artist's head as far as what the lyrics might mean because the bottom line is, while Josh co-wrote most of the songs on the new CD, that mostly means that he wrote the music but not necessarily the lyrics. Therefore, I don't really interpret the overall feeling of this CD as being a downer or depressing or that it means Josh's love life has seen brighter days.  And I really do not understand the one reviewer who said they found this CD self-indulgent.So, for me, this latest attempt by Josh is a definite winner and I look forward to what he will give us next.\n", "val": 0.0037947609089314938}

His voice is showing growth and has a richer, fuller sound on this album.  There are more songs on this that are vocally more difficult.  I love that he did it.

Most of the songs are just okay...pretty dull...and the lyrics to the one about Galileo are so trite as to be almost comical.  There's no flow to the songs.

{"text": "I have been following Josh's career since almost the beginning, but I'm not a hard core Grobanite.  I don't hang out on his website anymore or follow his every move like a desperate puppy.  I listen to his music with an open mind, just like I would any artist, and try to judge it on its own merits, without comparing it to what has come before.  I know it's hard to accept something different from an artist when you have grown to love their previous style so much.  I'm a huge Queen fan, and I remember how shocked I was when they released \"Hot Space,\" but I came to love it in time.  An artist wouldn't be an artist if they stayed in the same safe groove their entire career.  They have to branch out.I don't think Josh has done anything shockingly different with this release, but he has changed and evolved in small, subtle ways.  I must confess, I really LIKE it.  That doesn't mean his earlier work wasn't good, this is just another side of his talent.I personally find these songs so beautiful, they break my heart.  The arrangements are wonderful, with instruments used in ways one doesn't normally hear in this context, and Josh's voice in these songs - there are simply no words to describe it.  I love the deep richness and the expanded range - I think he is relying more on his baritone here and not trying so hard to be a tenor.  And contrary to what others have written, I think he has poured every ounce of passion he has into writing and singing these songs.  I can almost feel his yearning for something he hasn't found yet.  It makes me want to cry.  I'm still trying to decipher what all the lyrics mean, and I doubt my interpretations will be the same as his or anyone else's, but that doesn't really matter.  And I love the subtle Irish/Celtic/Bluegrass flavor of so many of the songs.  I'm not going to review each song individually, but there is something wonderful about every one of them.  There are none that I just don't want to listen to, like on some of his previous releases.  I'm really not a fan of the French language in song, but I can't bring myself to dislike that song either.Again, this is an honest review.  I haven't listened to any of Josh's past music in quite a while, so maybe I'm able to be more open-minded with this release because I'm not comparing it so closely to what has come before.  But I think it's very good and I applaud Josh for not playing it safe and trying something new, regardless of what the fans might think.  He doesn't have anything to be ashamed of here.  This may be his \"Hot Space,\" an album that is loved more by his fans in 20 years than right now, but there's no doubt it's a work of quality and he should be proud.  I'm extremely proud of him and I hope he keeps branching out and reaching for excellence in his art.Just listen to these songs without preconceptions and comparisons.  Put aside what YOU expect and want to hear and just listen as you would a new artist you hadn't heard before.  I think you will find much that is wonderful in this release, and those that criticize it now may come to love it as time goes on.  New music, as with new shoes, often requires a \"breaking in\" period before a listener can fully appreciate it, especially when that music is a departure from what the listener is expecting. Give this release the benefit of that breaking in period and I think you will find Josh doesn't let you down.I would not hesitate to recommend this album to any music lover, either for themselves or as a gift.  I'll be giving it as a Christmas gift myself.\n", "val": 0.02330905757844448}

That is probably my biggest complaint. On previous Josh albums, I have had very emotional connections / responses to multiple tracks. This one......not one so far, although Bells is sgtarting to have a weird effect on me.The album feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be. It is the same as P!nks \"Funhouse\". Good songs, but the album didn't flow.....everything seemed all over the place. For some artists, this works, but for Josh, P!nk and others, it doesn't.My biggest complaint, is that Josh sounds bored. There is not the Ummmph that his previous albums have had. I really thought that due to the long break and the new Rubin collaboration, there would be some excitement in his vocals......he sounds bored.Do I enjoy the album? Yes. Will it be played over and over......no. Maybe certain tracks will grow on me, but I think this one will go on the shelf and Awake will continue to be played until the next one comes out.Nothing wrong with someone putting out a less than glowing album.

Of course it won't be liked at first because sometimes we get used to the same kind of music over and  over. This album not. It is a kind of progresive pop and a serious try to get into something original and use THE voice in a major way. The recording is brilliant, the orchestations  magical.

{"text": "I will admit to having a bit of an obsession with Josh Groban. I check in on his web site regularly to see what is going on, and I follow him on Twitter. So I've been following the making of this album for quite a while, and was anxiously awaiting its release. My husband, who does not share my obsession, even bought me the Special Edition CD from the JG web site for my birthday, and just about every day I regale my mother with the latest funny thing Josh said on Twitter, or the progress they were making on the album. I have been emotionally invested in the making of this album for quite a while.When they first released \"Hidden Away,\" I was a little taken aback, because this just wasn't what I've come to expect from Josh Groban. But as I listened to it again, without preconceptions, I realized I did like it. In fact, I liked it a lot. When the next song, \"Voce Existe Em Mim,\" was released, I liked it immediately, and I've liked all the other songs, as well. I view this album very favorably. There are some songs I like more than others, and some of the lyrics don't make sense to me at first, but overall I think it's a great album. I don't mind not understanding the lyrics initially, though, because the words aren't just thrown in my face. I have to think about them, and we are all free to form our own opinions as to what did Josh mean by that? I think he is pretty enigmatic with his lyrics, and that's not a bad thing. I think the only words that really, really bug me are in \"Galileo\" with the phrase \"and thank the guy\". I know that is not one of the songs that Josh co-wrote, but the word just seems out of place. I know it rhymes, and I don't know what other word could be used instead, but it grates on me. I like the song - I just have a problem with the way that particular line was worded.I love \"The Bells of New York City.\" I live in Connecticut, and I used to go down to NYC several times every year to see a Broadway show. I know the magic that the city can hold, especially in winter, and I recall leaving the city on our bus and feeling a little sad about having to go. As we drove away, I would watch the receding lights and imagine what it would be like to live there. He captured that feeling so well.I had a difficult time at first with War At Home. I could not listen to it without getting choked up, and when I tried to read the lyrics to my mother, I just burst out crying. I come out of the Vietnam War era, and had many classmates and friends who went to war there, and either did not come back, or came back to a very different reality. The song just tapped into a part of me that I hadn't looked at for a long time. I understand he was motivated to write this song by a visit to Walter Reed, but the song is really timeless - it holds true for all wars. I found it interesting that he wrote about them being back home and still being at war, although a very different kind of war. I can imagine a soldier coming home with PTSD or traumatic brain injury and being told that \"you're a lucky one\", because he's still alive, and still has all his limbs. Sometimes it's the wounds we can't see that are the most difficult to heal. The most pertinent line from the song, I thought, was \"he's our unlearned lesson.\" Yup.I got introduced to Josh Groban's music indirectly by my mother. She's liked his music from when he first got started, and has all his albums. She pre-ordered the CD, and when I asked her what she thought of it, she told me she hated it. He was straining his voice. The piano chords were too loud. He was a lousy songwriter - it seemed to her that he just pushed out whatever they came up with, and that the lyrics were just plain stupid. Pretty rough, but I've seen a few reviews on here that are pretty much along those same lines.I think that people have very definite attitudes about him. He is not a middle-of-the-road performer. You either love him, or hate him. I have one friend that just can't stand him at all, and another friend who is as passionate about him (his music, I mean) as I am. People seem to have strong opinions about him - one way or the other. I have a theory that Liberals are the ones that like Illuminations, and Conservatives are the ones who don't. I'm only half-joking, because he doesn't fit into a set mold and he's always willing and eager to mix things up a bit, and not let himself get pigeon-holed. From the negative reviews that I've read, there seemed to be a central theme - why did he walk away from what made him so successful, and how could he be so self-indulgent as to make an album like this?My sister said she didn't care what Josh sang - he could sing row, row, row your boat, and it would still sound good. So my mother sent her CD to my sister - Mom just didn't even want to keep it. After my sister heard it, she sent a note to Mom (and bcc: me) that just said \"row, row, row your boat.\"P.S.The Grammy awards were held tonight. I didn't watch them - I only saw the previews, but I was surprised and disappointed that Josh and Illuminations were not nominated. I looked at who some of the nominees were, and thought they must be joking. Josh is so much more talented than most of them there - and I couldn't stop thinking about why this hadn't happened for him. Then I looked at a listing of the nominees, and one thing that struck me was that there were a lot of caricatures up for awards. Trying to sing is only part of their shtick - being outrageous (in either appearance or performance - or both) seemed to be the thing they were selling. At least that's how it looked to me. I mean - Justin Bieber? Lady Gaga? Well, she's definitely an entertainer, I'm not sure what Justin is, but I don't think he's very talented. But then, I'm not 14 years old.We know a few things about Josh that may be the reason the Grammy has eluded him. Nobody will argue that he's got a beautiful voice - possibly the best voice out today in any category. But he does his thing - especially more so with Illuminations. Beautiful as they are, some people are turned off by the foreign language songs he sings. I don't know why, but I've seen that mentioned several times. Another thing is - he's not flashy. Usually when you see him perform he's in some kind of long-sleeved tee in a dark color, jeans and his boots. He does the suit thing when required for a specific performance, but his usual get-up is jeans and tee. And with his longish curly hair and stubble of a beard, he's not exactly out there suiting up for Saturday Night Fever.But that's him. And as sorry as I am (and probably plenty of other people) that he didn't get any Grammy nominations, I bet it doesn't bother him that much. He's said numerous times that he's more proud of this project than any other he's done. If you can go away from a project like Illuminations and feel really good about what you did - is a Grammy going to really matter all that much?\n", "val": 0.012132608331739902}

He is a very good singer.  this album just feels like he is going through something heavy in life, maybe he is?<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Voice-Lessons-To-Go-v-1-4-The-Complete-Set/dp/B0019HBVFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Voice Lessons To Go v. 1-4 The Complete Set</a>\n", "val": 0.005758598912507296}
{"text": "I have listened to this new album a dozen or more times now. I have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current. I even pulled out the DVD \"albums\" and gave them a listen as well. \"Closer\" without question is his very best album - the most solid performance from track to track. \"Illuminations\" is without question the worst. There is no other artist who I listen to more over time than Mr. Groban. His songs have soothed away many stressful moments and days. His voice is unlike any other. He is talented and a gifted singer and song writer. Yet this does not change the fact that this new album is hands down the worst. In some ways, I wish it was never been released. For it tarnishes his previous accomplishments. I do not blame Mr. Groban for this, even though he chose his producer, but I do blame his advisors and most of all, the producer. Rick Rubin is no David Foster. Even though I am not a personal fan of David Foster - his arrogance is not very becoming. His ability to but together solid albums and attach songs to the right performer for the right \"hit\" is without question impeccable. And with this said, maybe he deserves to be arrogant. Mr. Groban does have the ability to write some very moving songs. The best ones have been in collaboration with other more experienced writers. Redirection is needed for the next album. Heck, if it was me, I would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing less than his very best. Many of the standards which Mr. Groban has sung off albums in various performance venues could lay the ground work for such an album. Yet there has to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage. This is where the experienced writers in the rock, pop and classical venue could bring works together to pull off an album unlike any other. In the end, this is just my opinion, among many starry eyes Grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour. Let's hope he performs only two or three songs from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishments and those outstanding performances you have added along the way at many of your venues. I wanted this album to be better than any of the previous albums. My hopes were high thus why I am so disappointment by this collection of songs. Without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album. This does shine through despite the haphazard collection of songs that make up \"Illuminations\".

{"text": "I'm not qualified to write a music review. This is an opinion piece.I was nervous about this album. Josh kept saying how different it was, how \"stripped down,\" how personal. Stripped down and personal sounded perfect, as long as the voice was still there.The first taste he gave us was \"Hidden Away.\" It left me underwhelmed. Then he gave us a clip of the creation of \"Voce existe em mim.\" I was left mesmerized and aching for more.And finally, the whole album. On first listening, I was somewhat unimpressed and disappointed. But it's Josh, so I played it again. Then again. And dang it, now I can't stop listening. It's a drug, and I'm addicted. Finally, we have it. Josh's voice; Josh's music; Josh's heart.This is the way I see it: David Foster gave Josh his first two-wheeled bike, and showed him how to ride it. But David never took the training wheels off, and he never took his hand off the seat.Rick Rubin threw the training wheels away, gave Josh a shove, and said, \"Go ride your bike.\"Like all the rest of us, Josh wrecked a few times. Rode off into the bushes once or twice, maybe even ran off the road into a ditch. Scratched and bruised, he kept getting back on.I, too, wish he'd abandon the falsetto; I find it unnecessary and distracting. Josh, we love your BARITONE. One of my favorite things about this album is that it does take him back to the basement - or at least the ground floor - where we all fell in love with him in the first place. He still visits the \"mad heights,\" where he sometimes loses his balance, more than I wish he would.I didn't care for \"Straight to You.\" I hated \"They Won't Go When I Go\" (available only on-line for those who bought the \"special Internet-only fan edition\"). But, the more I listen, the more I hear, and they're both growing on me - like fungus. And in \"They Won't Go,\" Josh tumbles all the. Way. Down. To his bottom range.Strangely, in the first few hearings, I didn't really hear Josh's voice - just a frail imitation. I don't know why; now it's absolutely there, in all (well, maybe almost all) its glory.My most serious criticism is the similarity of several of the songs: \"Bells,\" \"If I Walk Away,\" \"Higher Window,\" and \"Love Only Knows.\" Oddly my favorites on the album, still they sound so similar that the intros don't tell me which song is playing.This won't be my favorite Josh album. I love it for what he tried. I don't like it for what it ended up being: Less about his voice, more about his song-writing. And Josh, I love you dearly, but dear boy - you're no Paul Simon. But this is new, it's fresh, and it's beautiful. For a while, it slakes the thirst.Keep practicing, Josh. In no time, you'll be handling that bike like a master.\n", "val": 9.925888298312202e-05}
{"text": "Wow, I did not realize this album had polarized fans as the reviews appear to indicate!I have enjoyed Josh's music for years and really do love his \"booming baritone.\" While I agree that his voice is more suited to operatic-type pieces in a variety of languages, I'm finding that the styling of several of the songs on this album do showcase his range and emotion, particularly Bells of NY City and Love Only Knows.This album tries to please everyone -- songs that start with a simple acoustic guitar inevitably end up with soaring strings. I understand Josh's desire to step out a bit and believe that he CAN, but that someone was trying to hard to please the fans who appreciate the huge orchestral accompaniments we're used to on previous albums.That being said, the more I listen to this album, the more I WANT to hear it. I noticed that people have reacted negatively to his \"falsetto\" in some songs. I find it poignant and very suited to the mood. It's one of the things I like best about this album!

To me, there's not much musically pleasing in regards to melody, harmony, and even the lyrics. There are a few ok songs particularly the first one which is an intrumental which leads you to think that this prelude sets the tone for the rest but it doesn't.

None of the songs give me chills like Josh's older stuff and I don't like the style he is going towards. I loved what he did with David Foster and yes I wish he would go back to what he does best. The other comment I have to say is that all the falsetto drives me up the wall. I was not a fan of February song for that reason. I think Higher Window and Hidden Away would be beautiful songs if the falsetto was taken out. It is just too much. I hope Josh's next CD is back to what he did in his earlier days because he has such a beautiful voice and I'm sure I will have it on preorder like every other one.

{"text": "I have been a Grobanite since he debuted with his self titled album and I adored and performed his music ever since. His first cd was pretty good. His second offering, Closer, was his masterpiece. It's one of the few albums that I can listen to beginning to end. And then he decided the start experimenting. I moderately like Noel, with Little Drummer Boy being the best on the album. Awake was a little better. Most of Awake was great until you get to the African songs and your ears start bleeding.And now we come to Illuminations. I was highly disappointed with this cd. Josh's strengths have never included liberal use of falsetto. He just uses it at the wrong times and in abundance. Falsetto is great for creating dynamics but when you use it this much, it lessens the effect. The minimalist approach is boring and leaves you unfulfilled. I hate it when things stay on one dynamic: boring. Josh has always excelled at having songs range from subdued and soft to grand enveloping all in the same song but that is a rarity in Illuminations. And if you think Josh's voice is at it's best here, then you clearly never listened to his self titled album or Closer. He has steadily declined from each album. His first cd was the most perfect in terms of technique. Closer he kept similar quality but dropped a little of the technique to sound more personable and himself. Awake...eh it's cringe-worthy depending on the song (\"So she dances\" anyone?)You can keep this one Josh, I'll stick with your other great works.\n", "val": 0.0026205196045339108}

The lyrics literally made me HOWL with laughter. To be honest, the first time I listened to the album, I was totally confused. I thought, am I listening to the right album?And then it clicked. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!There was this one night, Josh was sitting in his new Manhattan penthouse, bored out of his mind, playing around making amateur recordings on garageband. He realized he only had ONE CD-R left, and he couldn't decide if he wanted to record a love letter to Paul Simon, or an audition mix tape to send to Webber and Sondheim and the like... so he compromised and squeezed them both onto one disk. Then his new manager called demanding new material. In his pot brownie induced stupor, Josh accidentally put the wrong disk in the envelope. The actual album he was working on, the amazing album that he's been slaving over for four years is in Paul Simon and Andrew Lloyd Webber's fan mail bags.That's basically what it sounds like to me. His broadway audition mixtape smashed together with a love letter to Paul Simon.

If you plop it in your five disc changer along with all of his earlier CDs you can get that Illuminations is a logical evolutionary move for him. The more \"operatic\" songs connect the CD to his earlier CDs. The more contemporary songs take his work in a bit of a new direction, but also provide a connection to the contemporary songs on his earlier CD.To become and remain successful, artists must remain faithful to their art, their niche in the music kingdom, the listeners who underwrite their success. They must also remain fresh, re-invent themselves, renew themselves, continue to grow, without devolving into charicatures of the themselves or, worse, another artist.

Josh brings out more of his personal side in this album. The songs on this album are so beautiful, and, as I've read, many of them were done in one take, that's amazing and it still sounded incredible. I've been a fan of Josh Groban's for the past 8 years now. I've heard pretty much all of his repertoire and the voice that comes out of that man still is unreal to me, even after all these years. I admire his higher register and his lower register; his range is beyond belief now. Kudos Josh for yet another \"Illuminating\" album. Keep the great music coming!\n", "val": 0.07871045172214508}

The songs are terrible with the exception of Hidden Away and Higher Window...which are the only two that somewhat remotely resemble the \"old\" Josh.  The rest are just painful to listen to and some, such as Galelio..are just plain strange.  I would describe most of the songs as a cross between folk-type music and a really bad Broadway Musical.Ok Josh, the experiment is over...please get back to the music that made you what you are and that you sing so brilliantly..PLEASE.I wasted my $$ on this CD and sadly I will pass when he tours with this album.  I don't think I could sit thru two hours of Illuminations without ear plugs.Sorry Josh, Im a big fan and this was hard for me to write.

{"text": "I came a little late to the Josh Groban party; he already had three albums out and the Christmas one on the way. I think that may be why changes in style and mood from album to album don't bother, or delight, me as they do fans who've been there from the beginning. I recognize \"Illuminations\" is a hard right turn away from previous efforts, but there is a lot to enjoy here.\"Hidden Away\" and \"Higher Window\" are real surprises for me; they're simple, beautiful songs, and not unlike the song \"Awake\" from the album of the same name; however, the melodies are very strong here and the lyrics feel close to home. \"Straight to You\" is starting to look like my favorite song of his: the interpretation is sublime, the instrumentation inspired, and I like that he stays in mid-range, which reinforces the lyrics of the chorus.\"Voce Existe Em Mim\" is the coolest song he's ever done. Had he stuck to the previous albums' formula, this could have had the track 1 spot. Obviously the beat is killer. And do the chords in the chorus sound distinctly...Native American? Even cooler. There are a lot of amazing layers in these songs, some of which require the use of headphones to fully appreciate.\"London Hymn\" is where I started to think I understood the underlying inspiration JG was working from. I don't know too much about his musical roots - I know he loves the theater - but it's hard not to think he owns a lot of classical music. When you hear pieces like Rachmaninov's \"Vespers\" or Sibelius' \"Andante Festivo,\" it's extremely easy to make the transition to \"London Hymn\" or \"Straight to You.\"There are other strong songs - \"If I Walk Away,\" \"War at Home,\" \"L'Ora Dell'Addio.\" The French song was just okay for me, as were \"Bells of NYC\" and \"Galileo.\" He does use quite a lot of falsetto this time around, which is...interesting, and sometimes it's lovely and sometimes I kind of raise an eyebrow... \"The Wandering Kind\" sounds like Jim Brickman, and I just don't go for that kind of piano music. Something, instead, along the lines of Enya's \"A Day Without Rain\" would have completely made my day.While I understand the frustration of the fans who were hoping for a different style and selection of songs, some of the highly negative reviews here are just silly. One reviewer said it was the worst singing they had heard, maybe ever? If that is the case, whatever criteria they are using is so far from the realm of actual musical adjudication as to be basically worthless. Even his most over-eager fans are still right: he has one of the best voices, period. It doesn't help anyone to demean him for the sake of a one- or two-star review.I applaud him for trying new things, for taking a risk in a new direction, and I feel as though with this album I understand better who he is, as a person and musician. Hopefully he will get the overall sense that this was a success by his definition, and continue to find happiness giving of himself in the coming years.\n", "val": 0.040868017822504044}

{"text": "Josh Groban - IlluminationsRelease date: November 15, 2010143/Reprise RecordsSometime around September of 2001 I was introduced to a singer that would proceed to impress me in so many ways. Josh Groban was 20. I was older. I remember calling my son and saying, \"You should listen to this guy named Josh Groban. He has an amazing voice.\" My son responded, \"I will check him out, and you should listen to this guy named John Mayer.\" Nine years later and we are both still listening to and recommending these two artists.Josh Groban is very hard to define or place into a genre. He is a voice, but he is so much more. Illuminations is his fifth release, and all four prior releases have gone multi-platinum. His last release, Noel, was the number one selling CD in 2007 even though it was not released until October and was a Christmas album.The three years since this last release have seen many changes for Josh. He chose to head in a different direction with a new management team and new producer, Rick Rubin. Rubin has a resume that is beyond impressive, and artists such as Johnny Cash, Neil Diamond, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Metallica have trusted him. Rubin tends to do things in a way that was not the norm for Josh or his fans and likes to strip the performer down to what Rubin feels is essential for the music.Change is a bit scary for fans and the `Grobanites' on his fan sites have been concerned about this upcoming release. I shared their concern. I listened to the first three pre-release singles that went to iTunes and his websites and was not a fan of the higher notes of the songs and was afraid that the album was going to be a disappointment. However, after 22 listens over the past three days I can happily say that sometimes change can be a good thing. I was a huge fan of the old Josh. But the new Josh is damn good too. Illuminations will change how Josh is perceived for the rest of his career because it is a game changer.Josh's fans did not grow up with this type of music from Josh Groban. Josh Groban grew up with this CD.Josh is about the vocals. However, on this release Josh co-wrote the majority of the songs and proves that he can also write. After Illuminations I honestly believe he will be considered a talented songwriter and will expand his horizons to include not only theatre, TV and concerts but writing lyrics for others. He is that good. This CD is that good. Just turn the stereo up and listen.The album starts with an instrumental piece, \"Wandering Kind,\" that Josh wrote when he was twelve years old. Josh fans are waiting to hear his voice, but this piece will still impress.The first vocal piece, \"Bells of New York City,\" makes it clear that this is going to be a very personal release. The lyrics take center stage and paint a very clear picture as \"the bells of New York City tell me not to go.\"\"Galileo\" is an exceptionally touching song of love. I can visualize this song in a musical and bringing endless applause. Picture the love of your life, put this song on, feel the passion.\"L'Ora Dell'Addio\" is the first of four songs that are not sung in English. However, this was a positive thing because I was not distracted by lyrics and could focus on the music and the voice. Josh's vocal abilities shine. The song made me stand up. It made me pump my fists. If anyone, anywhere, has any question if he has IT in his voice still....YES. HE. DOES. At some point I would like to know what the words of the song mean, but for now I am blown away by its power and beauty.\"Hidden Away,\" \"Voc Existe Em Mim,\" and \"Higher Window\" can all be heard at [...] or purchased on iTunes. They are very good songs, and I can appreciate them as part of the whole. I give kudos for the way they were released prior to release date as a way of giving fans a preview of what is to come. However, I don't believe that they are the songs this release will be remembered for.\"If I Walk Away.\" The lyrics and passion of this song are more than I can describe in words. This song is special. You want lyrics? You want instruments? You want meaning? Just listen. The song builds as instruments and backup vocals are added, but it then fades back away which keeps the song personal and intimate. \"If I walk away, please follow me.\"\"Love Only Knows.\" A big issue that fans had with the first pre-releases was the falsetto voice Josh used in the two English songs. This song begins with the same falsetto. However, it then begins to soar and all memory of the falsetto is wiped away. It totally won me over and the lyrics left me touched. \"I can't breathe without you and I know...we need each other.\" Sometimes words are so much more than they intend.\"War at Home.\" This song has made me think and listen again and again and again. Each time I listen I find a different interpretation and each one is poignant. I feel this will be a standing ovation song in concert. Its words are inspiring and Josh's delivery is powerful. \"You are not alone. You see these hands, they're a billion strong. They are yours now.\" The song builds with strength and allows Josh to excel at what he does so very well.\"London Hymn\" is a choral offering where Josh's strong voice is sometimes overwhelmed by the backup vocals. However, it leads straight into the final song in such a way that I won't be skipping this track because I like the segue.\"Straight to You.\" A Nick Cave song that finishes this CD perfectly with a message that is worth pondering.To the all the younger people reading this: buy this CD for your parents if not for yourselves. It. Is. Really. Really. Good.\n", "val": 0.019741639494895935}

I just finished listening to the whole CD and there doesn't seem to be any melody to his songs. It's like listening to opera. He should either go \"classical\" or go back to his melodic love songs that tell a story. I  understand he used to work with James Foster. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to go back with him. Also I wish Josh would stick to ALL Engish songs on his CDs. I love to sing along with him on my 1st two CDs but not this one.

{"text": "I've had an interesting time reading the reviews of this new CD by Josh Groban.  If people who say \"this isn't their Josh Groban\" paid attention to the press leading up to this CD, then they shouldn't be surprised.  This isn't David Foster's Josh Groban.  The grandiose, perfectly mastered songs aren't on this album.  Josh and Rick Rubin have clearly stated that this CD was recorded \"old style\" and in a somewhat different vein that prior CDs.  I can see where people say that he doesn't sound good on the CD.  To a point I agree.  The \"less couffed\" stylings are much more raw, and at times he does sound like he's working too hard or pitchy.  But that's how Josh wanted this CD to sound.  That said, I have recently heard Josh sing a lot of these songs live, and on stage they have a much better sound.As for those that say the songs aren't good, well, for the most part we part ways.  There are a few songs that I am not enamoured with.  \"Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourquoi is not a favorite of mine.  \"Galileo\" is another that I tend to pass on. (Both songs Josh did not write)  Sounds too much like songs Josh did early in his career that I was never fond of.  This album will have a different feel.  Know why?  Josh wrote/co-wrote the majority of the songs.  They are personal to him.  As I saw in a review somewhere else, depending on the prior CD Josh songs you love will dictate how you feel about \"Illuminations.\"  There were songs that did take me several listenings to appreciate, but I do think they are well written, and well orchestrated.  Many of those songs are my favorites on the CD.  \"Bells of New York City\" is amazing, and \"Love Only Knows\" is a Groban love song at it's finest.My best advice, give it more than one listen.  It might win you over the more you listen.\n", "val": 0.014989374205470085}

There are albums out there that need to be listened to several times before making a final decision, and I feel this is one of them.  After perhaps 3 or 4 more listens, I was mesmerized.  I found myself loving the simplicity of it all, if that is the right word.  The tunes are gorgeous and stay in my head day and night, the words are beautifully sad and sweet.  And then there's that voice---no need to gush because we all know.Any of you who might be disappointed in this cd really need to sit down and give it a few runs.  You will be amazed.

Here was something different, something that I wasn't used to hearing from Josh.

Standouts for me are Galileo, War at Home, Higher Window, and Love Only Knows. The beautiful lyrics and the raw emotion from Josh's voice lets me know just how much of himself Josh put into this CD.

The songs, the arrangements and yes even his vocals don't come close to meeting the standard that Josh has established in his career.  It pains me deeply to say that.I don't profess to know what is inside Josh's head, but I have a strong feeling that he was trying to go more \"mainstream\" with this album.  He once said that he realizes that sometimes he will lose fans on one end and pick new ones up on the other.  I think he is sadly mistaken.  I would be very shocked if he garners any new fans based on this mediocre cd.  And what is sadder yet is the fact that these are the songs we will be hearing him perform over the next couple of years, on tour, on tv appearances and yes perhaps even on the radio.Josh has said that he is proud of his fans and the fact that they are \"along for the ride\".

{"text": "I was not really a Josh Groban fan to begin with; however, a member of my family is, and I was dragged (kicking and screaming) to one of his concerts on the \"Closer\" tour back in 2003. Hearing him live, I was hooked, and I've followed his subsequent releases with interest.For this release, much more of Josh's original writing is included than on previous albums. To some extent, this has produced a rather different feel in the way of music, and apparently (judging from the reviews I'm seeing here) it is not to the tastes of some. It took me a couple of listens-through to figure it out. However, the effort has produced some delightful pieces. \"Bells of New York City\" has easily become my favorite Groban song of all time, just ahead of \"You Are Loved\" from his Awake album, and \"Remember When It Rained\" from Closer. I'm also extremely impressed with \"War At Home\", a song co-written with the incredible Hollywood composer James Newton-Howard. \"Galileo\" and \"Hidden Away\" are also standout and stunning songs. The introductory piece (instrumental only) was written by Josh when he was very young, and has an Irish-folk feel that would feel right at home in portions of the Riverdance soundtrack - it's different, but impressive. It's authentic Josh. Last but not least, \"Voc Existe Em Mim\" is a very impressive song (sung in Portuguese) that would be a fantastic start to the show on tour.Since the release of his \"Closer\" album, Josh's voice has been undergoing significant training, and has matured and changed dramatically from his first two studio-recorded albums. Some of these songs, as a result, are sung in a much higher and broader range than some of his previous material. So it does sound different at times than his voice did before, but that is certainly not unexpected for someone undergoing tremendous vocal training.Personally, I think that Josh should be careful not to stray too far from his roots in the months and years ahead, as some other artists have done through the years to their detriment. At the same time, there is always the possibility of becoming stale and repetitive. Within these two boundaries, there is a great deal of room for exploration, and I believe this album is a very nice expansion on his previous material. It's fresh, it's interesting, and it's different - but not so different to make the average open-minded listener clap their hands over their ears and run screaming from the room. The fantastically negative reviews I'm finding are a true shocker, and are - in my opinion - an extreme over-reaction to an exploration of Josh's boundaries.Kudos to Josh for exploring some interesting directions, and for providing a fresh and interesting album.

As for the songs, some of them I loved but some had lyrics with a little too much indecisive angst for my taste. Then was one I really disliked: Galileo.

And don't even get me started on the lyrics!This is not the time in Josh's career for him to get on his own personal hobby horse unless he wants to start escaping all that he has achieved and built up to this point. A radical scaling back of the Josh Groban sound that we have become used to actually leaves his vocal range and quality of tone appear distinctly lacking.This is like an album from a theatrical wannabe at the start of their career, not knowing in which direction they want to go and so, tries to cover all bases - a bit of folk, a few foreign language tracks (which are unbearable to listen to - unlike previous efforts), a few dirgy indie type tracks and a hymn! Oh and a single for radio.Poor old Josh - this recording is just low on good quality songs. I'm sure he must be at a personal/professional crossroads to have ever decided that the public should spend their hard-earned cash on this offering. Sadly, another album like this and my love affair with the music of Josh Groban will be over for good.Let's hope for a return to past form on the next release.

However, I find this album highly artistic, and a \"must have\" for any one who likes this genre of music. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 is that most tracks are written in a \"major scale\" (a technical thing for musicians to understand), and this doesn't exactly match my own personal taste.

Surely Josh Groban and Dan Wilson are capable of less shallow words -- When you read these without the music, they sound laughable -- and better melodies.  I see why the decision was made to release \"Hidden Away\" and \"Higher Window\" early, as these are the only memorable melodies of the bunch.  The piano prelude with no vocals( that Josh came up with when he was 12!!), much to my surprise, may be my favorite song on the entire CD.Even if you've been a big fan of Josh Groban in the past, I urge potential buyers to listen to this CD before taking the plunge to buy. I suspect that only the most diehard fans (and there are many) will want to add this album to their collection.\n", "val": 0.0002098985278280452}

First of all, it's not a holiday album (I didn't deduct stars for that, just wanted to clarify).  It's less opera-pop, and more nasally jarring.  Some of the tracks start out and his voice just isn't up to the standards found on the Christmas album.  It took me a couple of sittings just to get through the entire CD.  There may be some people who are die-hard fans who will like this, and that's great for them.

{"text": "This album is receiving a lot more bad reviews than it should. I am not surprised by this, but kind of confused by the critique it is getting.A lot of the complaints are that Josh should go back to his roots, where he got his start. This album does just that, it goes back to the style of his self-titled album and somewhat replicates 'Closer' in places, this is not at all like 'Awake' which many deemed a style change for him. It is very classical, with some pop inspiration and a tiny bit of 'folk' in places. It's a lot closer to his \"original\" style than 'Awake' was (which, for the record, I very much liked).There is also the complaint that he uses too much 'falsetto', I do agree with this, I wish he would spend a little bit more time in his lower range and while I can't ridicule him for wanting to get out of his comfort zone, I think he could have done it a little more sparingly. But that is a personal preference, we have far too many tenors out there, and a rarity in gorgeous baritones.All that being said, this album has a lot to offer, and while it might not be as good (in my opinion) as 'Awake' or 'Closer' it's still clearly Josh and he makes beautiful music. 'The Bells of New York' and 'Love Only Knows' are two of my favorites and the Prelude makes me smile. While this album is darker than his others, I think it just explores a new side of his music and art and it's interesting and wonderful. It might take some time to get used to this new style but the same thing happened when 'Awake' came out, and that turned out to be my favorite album of his, and I anticipate, in time, I will love this album dearly too.Yes, this album is different, it doesn't make him less talented or his art less beautiful.Signed,A non-fanatic Grobanite who appreciates the album for what it is.\n", "val": 0.017042918130755424}
{"text": "There seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fans to boost the ratings of this CD by posting glowing reviews, so it's going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give 5* to a recording of Groban reading the telephone directory. I also presume, therefore, that any reviews that are not favourable will come with a 2/17 people found this review of use attached. All I can say is that if you are considering purchasing this CD, are not a self-confessed music starved Groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several years, and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service - take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it. The mixed reviews really do indicate that this album is polarising listeners and fans, not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that has crept in. You may enjoy it, but I would try before you buy first.My own personal thoughts --I will freely admit that I was never a serious fan of the early work Groban did with David Foster and I don't view this as a Foster v Rubin thing, so this isn't a hankering for a return to the older style recordings. In fact, I was eagerly anticipating this album based on what Groban had said about changing direction. He had actively played that up in interviews and the choice of working with Rick Rubin seemed to indicate this, as did his live version of \"Changing Colours\" which I really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often. However, I don't feel that he's done that. And yet, at the same time, I think he's charged off in many different directions. I just do not know what to make of this album, even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when I'd rather have left it alone. I'm aware that some albums require work to grow on you, hence I wanted to give it a chance, but this isn't happening. Sadly it's the opposite effect and every time I listen, there is a reinforcement of why I do not enjoy it and can't face listening to some of the tracks. The Nick Cave cover? Massive orchestral arrangement. An Italian song? Massive orchestral arrangement. London Hymn? I'm expecting to hear it booming out of Westminster Abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock. Interspersed with songs that are, I presume, the stripped-down sound Groban was hoping to achieve. To me, it just doesn't flow or have any coherence as an album. I just feel that it's trying to be so many different things, and in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark.I find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written as; I honestly believe that Groban, judging from Awake's \"February Song\", can express a far greater depth of emotion than he does here. Some of the harsher remarks regarding the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed in some reviews are, I probably can guess, even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for Groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fans. Having said that, I certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically - even if it sometimes misses the mark.I can't face giving this one star, because I don't want to relegate it to that level and I genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their own boundaries. But I wish I would have waited before ordering the CD - like another reviewer, I can't cancel the order winging its way over the Atlantic. Sadly it's staying in the packaging, to be gifted to someone that I'm probably not that close to.Edited to add --I have noticed some commenting regarding what I said about fans posting positive reviews because of a perceived backlash to the album. My comments came as a result of a thread on his official boards, [...], entitled \"Be sure to leave a 4 or 5 star review on Amazon.com. The CD could use them.\" I merely think that people who are not fans, and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them, should hear a balance of opinions. JG fans have (rightly or wrongly) a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him, and whilst all the positive reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album, many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music - that thread was sent as a link to many fans, and as such it could have an impact on here. I think it's only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves.\n", "val": 0.0003234988544136286}

However, unlike many of the faithful, I think that it must be said that this album features some of the worst vocals I have ever heard.  From anyone.  That they are from Josh Groban, whose baritone I think is undescribably beautiful, is a severe disappointment.  The vocal tracks outreach his ability in the upper ranges.  At points it is almost physically painful to listen to him stretch in an attempt approach the notes.  The fact that he fails to achieve that goal at times is even worse.  After all, if he can't hit the vocals in the studio, I don't even want to imagine how some of the live performances will go.  Add to that the simplistic lyrics of some of the songs - the worst of which Josh did not pen, thank goodness - and you get, in my opinion, an album that is best left on the shelf.

The music is forgettable and the lyrics terrible. I know Josh wrote a lot of them but he really needs to realize that song writing is not his forte. That is not his talent but singing is and that is what he should stick with. Josh's music has brought so much joy to me through listening to it, but this album just disappoints especially since it was so long since the last one.

{"text": "After seeing so many 1 star reviews, I just can't help but edit my review here. For anyone who gives this CD a 1 star, please go out and actually FIND and LISTEN to a 1 (or even 2) star album, then ask yourself if this album actually deserves such harsh criticism.I used to be very skeptical about people making a big deal of track ordering, but this album just shows me that track orders do matter. Even though I think \"If I walk Away\" and \"Love Only Knows\" are the weak tracks in the album, I don't want to skip them when I'm listening - this album just has that nice flow, making me want to listen from the very first minute to the last. When I fit the puzzles of preview songs into the big picture, they sound better than they used to. The album demonstrates how a good album should be - a collection of songs built around one concept, but each has its own flavor.My favorite track is \"Bells of New York City\" - maybe because I have a deep love for that city, too. The piano riff is simple, but perfect for the sound of bells. And Josh's depiction of the city in winter is so lively - I can almost feel the snow falling from the sky, shining in the headlights of those yellow cabs; and the wind bringing the winter chill to my face, yet feeling warm at the same time, just like the city. Rubin said they were trying to do something grand. They made it. The song is personal and intimate, while it's grand at the same time; it makes me feel humbled, in anonymity.The cover of \"Galileo\" is another stunning piece. I can't really find words to describe this song. It brings up so many things - those bittersweet memories, the innocent ages, and the pure love long gone.I have a growing love for \"Higher Window\". When I first listened to it on my computer, I wasn't so impressed. But after listening to it with my AKG K701, I'm deeply touched by the its subtlety and melancholy.Another great song is \"War at Home\". It has the gravity that can be easily related to the earth, to the lost souls in the war. It was not something I would expect from Josh, but I couldn't be more grateful to see him writing a piece like this, heavy but refined.This is one of a handful of albums that I cannot find any song I dislike. Even with my long time favorite \"Closer\", I can pick one or two. In this sense, I should probably list \"Illuminations\" as my favorite Josh's album so far. True that the songs seem not to have that mind blowing power as some old Josh's songs do - and I think they are not supposed to be. I can see why some people hate it so much; it's not a typical classical pop album, it doesn't have the flair that Josh's albums used to have. \"Illuminations\" is more artistic, more thoughtful. It requires a good stereo system (or a good pair of headphones) and a lot of time to listen to. After being fed with so much modified sound, my K701 can finally enjoy a crystal clear album this time. I'm fascinated by how many beautiful details there are in the orchestration and arrangements; these acoustic sounds are so brilliant. What's better is that the simpler arrangement creates a less swelling sound that doesn't distract me from listening to Josh's beautiful voice.Overall, I'm more than content to see that Josh becomes such an outstanding musician. Accomplished as he is, he's still venturing to new territories - in the music world, this is what keeps a musician alive and young. \"Illumination\" is a brave and thoughtful move, and deserves to be appreciated and embraced. So, for people who said this album is boring or amateurish, I recommend you sitting down in a very quiet room, playing it again on a real CD player, from the beginning to the end, and listening to it with your heart. Then maybe you can understand it more. Maybe you can understand him more.\n", "val": 0.03055107593536377}

I realize Josh has spent the last four years pouring his heart and soul into this music, shouldering the majority of the writing of most of the songs.  I really wanted to like it, but was so underwhelmed by \"Illuminations.\"  Almost all of the songs were sad, boring, and pretty much interchangeable.  I was taken by how depressing the entire album is!!!!  There is nothing uplifting or inspirational about any of the songs, which is so unlike all of his previous CD's.  While the melodies are beautiful and majestic, most of the lyrics are bland and very amateurish sounding--they just don't ring true.  I know Josh tends to gravitate toward melancholy songs (this is by his own admission), but does EVERY song have to be so sad?  In addition, I think he tried to remake the song \"Vincent\", the Don McLean classic that Josh covered on his first CD, into \"Galileo,\" which sort of has the same theme.  I must say, it just didn't work. In Josh's defense, \"Hidden Away\" and \"The War at Home\" were okay, but they were not enough to salvage the entire CD. Josh Groban can do better than this.

The songs in Italian, French & Portuguese are lovely to listen to even if I can only pick out the meaning of a few words . . . at present.  \"If I Walk Away\" is a pleasant, low key song that is told with mandolins and violins that crecendos with piano towards the end . . . a simple, yet poignant plea.  \"Love Only Knows\" puts the question out there of \"will what we have work out?\" to music, it makes you pause and think and the title is the answer.  \"War At Home\" acknowledges the struggle of service men and women (whether domestic or overseas) adjusting to coming home after fighting in a touching and moving way.  \"London Hymn\" is a flowing and haunting, chant-like song that's like a small homage to music of the middle ages.  \"Straight to You\" is almost like a hymn that's being sung whenever things are falling apart and you're seeking comfort.  I love & am most familiar with the songs \"Hidden Away\" and \"Higher Window\" since I got the singles of them before the album released; these songs have just beautiful lyrics and moving piano playing.  \"Hidden Away\" is just a beautiful plea to reveal who you really are: that extraordinary part of you that you hide from the eyes of everyone else-which speaks to everyone since everyone does that in some way!  \"Higher Window\" is just a beautiful story of the various stages of two soulmates.

Now I am constantly amazed at his work and I looked forward to this release for a while.  My special edition CD is a Christmas gift so I only have the digital copy for now, but I think that is more than sufficient for me to review the music within.  Many reviews complain that it sounds amateur and not polished.  I think it is brilliant.  My favorite thing about Josh is that his voice needs no adjustment to be album worthy.  I once saw him in a music awards show performing live and after all the famous pop stars sang horribly, he sang flawlessly and put them all to shame.  I appreciate his natural talent, and his songs are all touching, even the ones I cannot understand a word of.My first run through of this album left me a little cold.  But that is not surprising to me because I think his music goes a little over my head the first time.  With more listens, I pick up more and more until I love the whole thing so much I don't want to turn it off.  I have several of the songs stuck in my head now and I love this time of learning lyrics for future sing-alongs.  He is an amazing artist, as ever, and I think his years of work have paid off.  People who miss the huge swelling music in every song just need to get over it because Josh can sound good without all that crap.  He sounds good with it too, but why not prove himself?

There are many great things about where Josh is as a musician, but as for the CD, I must say I'm disappointed.One thing I love about the album is the \"organic\" or \"stripped down\" production style, which I favor in general and I love for Josh's voice in particular.  His voice is naturally beautiful, a gift he's been given and that he's kind to share with all of us.  I love the rich baritone and the warm, kind quality that comes through.  It's soothing and let's the message of the song enter your soul with joy and calm.  No one can duplicate what Josh was born with and it's kudos to him for respecting his gift and continuing to treat his voice with TLC. It only seems to get better year after year.  I've always had the feeling that he doesn't hear in his own voice what his listeners hear.  So though he may know he has a high quality voice, he may not fully realize that his voice has a magical quality for many listeners, this one included.He seems to be in great form.  I'm happy that he took some time between CD's to be a person.  As a fan, he doesn't owe me music produced within a particular time frame.  An artist must be a person first, or else they'll have nothing to give.  I saw him in one of the \"before we begin\" concerts last month and his voice is better than ever.I'm happy that Rick Rubin pushed him to write and that it caused personal growth for him.  At the same time, I think Josh and Rick should have recorded Josh's best writing and procured some other pieces that fit his voice better for the remainder of the songs.  Higher Window in particular is a favorite of mine, but others on the CD are just OK.  So despite the great voice and favorable stripped down production, song selection is just so so and unfortunately that LARGELY affects the CD's quality, unfortunately.\n", "val": 0.015275511890649796}

It is erratic and unfinished; the songs go from simplistic and 'folksy' to mega orchestrations that make you feel like you should be in church on a kneeler and the only one who should be begging forgiveness is Groban himself who is offering up this unadorned, unassembled, incomplete work that doesn't compliment someone with such a classically trained voice at all.  True it would be a shame if he had been MIA for so many years and then fed his true fans more of the same ballads and classical pieces but these are what drew the fans to him in the first place.  Awake was very 'out of the box' for Groban and quite enjoyable but Illuminations feels like he dawdled for 4 years then threw together a cheese sandwich at the last minute and tossed to his starving fans who were chomping at the bit for something new to chew on.  I have heard this CD but I will not waste my money on buying it.  I have been a fan of Josh for 6 years and the fact that he put together such garbage and calls it 'the best he's ever done' really disappoints me and I'm not the only one.  There are many of his diehard fans who don't care for this tripe but are stomped to death by fans who are blinded by the fact that it's Josh and it's quantity over quality.

You wouldn't waste your money on another bowl just to see if you could grow accustomed to the new flavor would you?  Well after listening to it a few times just to see if I might \"learn\" to like it I decided that if I have to force or teach myself to like it then I really don't and there's no point in making me want to poke my eardrums out with a hot knitting needle.  You know the old saying \"love is blind\"?  Well in the Grobanite's case you could say \"love is deaf\".\n", "val": 0.00012123412307118997}

As an artist he has more than one dimension and is showing a slightly different style.  The reviewers that were not favorable seem to object to this, but I don't like it when an artist becomes so predictable over the years that it becomes uninteresting.  This cd highlights several types of songs and the collection, when put together, is fabulous.  I think this was well worth the wait!\n", "val": 0.0529305525124073}

In fact I believe this is a real masterpiece but these songs require to be listened to with good equipment ( and no, I don't consider laptop speakers as good equipment)and also in a quiet setting and probably more than once- and I expect nothing less from a brilliant cd.  It's totally different to what he did before but that doesn't mean this cd is better or worse than his previous cd's - it's DIFFERENT and that's a good thing, otherwise it would be pretty boring. Some previous reviewer complained that there's no \"You raise me up\" or \"You are loved\" on this cd to which I can only say \"Thank God\" because those songs were already on other cd's and I don't want to hear them all over again.To cut it short: it's a brilliant piece of art- the songs are all high above standard and Josh sings them with so much passion and emotion like never before. The instrumentation is brilliant, too- you'll here something new each time you listen to it. I can't recommend a song because I really like them equally, my only recommendation would be to give it a chance , get some good earphones and take your time to listen.\n", "val": 0.013902160339057446}
{"text": "\"Illuminations\" is not even mediocre.  Not one song demands a second listen.  For example, I'm sure Josh had Don McLean's \"Vincent\" (a Groban personal favorite) in mind when he wrote \"Galileo\", but his ode to the astronomist (\"oh goody, I can sing about stars and skies again\") is just plain odorous.  It's a piece of contrived emotion that fails miserably.  And the others are even worse.Groban can sing, but whovever told him he could write did him a big disservice. There are plenty of penniless, passionate, \"straight from the heart\" songwriters out there who will stay broke because good intentions and a little bit of piano playing ability don't equate to song writing talent. Groban needs to write this album off as a horrific experiment and start seeking out the professionals who know how to create a memorable tune.A great voice needs a great song.  There are plenty of well written standards that Josh could introduce to a new audience and make them his own.  But not this junk.  This stuff wouldn't make the grade in a middle school talent show. It's a waste of time, talent, effort and money for everyone involved, not to mention the huge disappointment to fans who plunked down good money for this crap expecting something of caliber.\n", "val": 3.378266410436481e-05}

His voice is still amazing but the song selection is just bad, not a lot of variety there. A few songs I even feel he shouldn't have done them at all, as they did not go well with his voice. It doesn't touch me this time and I have to blame his producer on the bad song selection. He could've done a lot better than this. The whole album is just boring and does not chime with me.

This small stage venue and then listening to his new album twice since then has me more enamored of his unique and stunning voice than ever.  I agree with the reviewers this is a stripped down Josh and what he intended to do when deciding to work with Rick Rubin. The soul and sincerity of his songs are touching and almost mournful;right from his heart.  He took a risk with this and for that I applaud him. Going out of his comfort zone.  I am a long time fan of that glorious rich voice and never tire of listening to him. Who sings like that???I agree I wasn't so thrilled with Galileo either, but all the others are perfect in every way and I too will continue to listen over and over until I have heard every lyric and nuance and note of this piece of art.

When I met him, I told him how his music gave my dying grandfather so much comfort - he hugged me and I was so grateful. I love Josh Groban as a musician...and as a very kind person.  I am a long-time Grobanite and I support his humanitarian efforts whenever I can. I am going to be honest here, as others are not, in the hopes that Josh will grow from this experience.\"Illuminations\" is a life lesson for Josh. He wanted to spread his wings - as most performers eventually do when they feel misunderstood or held back.  Change your management...change your producer...change the formula...write your own music...depart from the norm...move to a new city...finally get that Grammy!  If it works, great...The problem is, it doesn't usually work and you lose dedicated fans, the label loses money, the tour under-performs...and the artist learns that you will never be loved by everyone - best to please those who already do love you and find another way to grow....like say, acting on TV or hey - Broadway!What does Josh really want to be when he grows up? Once the dye is cast, you can change pieces, but not the entire dye. Josh's voice is gorgeous - he needs to grow that big voice.  Bocelli...Buble...Dion - all huge voices that are not trying to be what they're not...all of which have Grammys...all of which have David Foster.This CD is a case of artistic defiance - it is an artist's attempt to grow.

{"text": "I will not lie: I am a Josh Groban fan.  I own Awake, Closer, Josh Groban and the \"best\" songs from Noel, and Josh's live album.  As soon as I discovered a new album in the works early in 2010, I found myself constantly checking Josh's website for details.  Illuminations was released without much to-do on November 15, 2010.  So, naturally, I bought it...November 15. And it has already been well listened to.Obviously, I'm pleased with the new album.  But, lyrically and musically, how does it stand up to Josh's earlier releases?  Does this album stand alone?  Or am I being seduced by Josh's rich, lyrical voice?Illuminations will be enjoyed by long time fans of classical/pop crossover, and will hopefully attract some new listeners as well.  Those who complained that Josh only produces \"sweet and corny love songs\" will find Illuminations a bit more down to earth.  Long time fans will be pleased that Josh's voice still shines in four different languages, and the thirteen songs will leave listeners satisfied but not overwhelmed.  The instrumentation seems simultaneously grander and more raw.  Do I like it?  Yes, I do.  Will you?  I don't know, but this might help:Song Break Down:1) The Wandering Kind (Prelude)  An instrumental piece is an interesting way for a vocal artist to start an album.  Even so, it's one of my favorite tracks.  Piano driven in the beginning, it dissolves into a pretty little piece that reeks of romantic melancholy.  Good noveling music.2) The Bells of New York City  Pretty, romantic, sad...hey, sounds like The Wandering Kind!  Not much to it lyrically, but the music is beautiful.  Every time this song starts, I think it's something by Phillip Glass.  According to my mother (who is also a Groban fan), it's a disguised Christmas song.3) Galileo (Someone Like You)  Unfortunately, I don't like this song at all.  The lyrics aren't really there and don't seem to match the music.  Sorry, Josh, but this one's a dud.4) L'Ora Dell'Addio  Slow and a little sad, this song show's Groban's voice nicely.  Some parts feel like lyrically cramming.5) Hidden Away  Please don't keep your love hidden away.  A sweet song requesting a girl to show her love, instead of hiding it.  This song reminds me of You Are Loved6) Au Jardin Des Sans-Puorquoi  It's French.  Nothing else, good or bad, sticks out about this song.7) Higher Window  One Amazon.com reviewer complained that this song \"sounded religious\".  It does, but it's subtle and I can't decide what religion it's referring to.8) If I Walk Away A \"poppier\" tune than some on this album.9) Love Only Knows  Another pop influenced song.10) Voce Existe Em Mim  Possibly the coolest non-English song I've ever heard (it's in Portuguese, if you were curious).  I love it.  Go listen to it.11) War At Home  Sad but encouraging without sappiness.  This is one of my favorites.  Two ambiguous uses of the word \"hell\".12) London Hymn  Composed of a creepy choir.  Moody and pretty, but lacks depth because, well, it lacks lyrics.13) Straight to You Other than some lyrics-not-matching-the-music problems, this is a wonderful song.  It also has a few phrases that might make Christians uncomfortable (Heaven has denied us it's kingdom/The saints are drunk and howling at the moon/ And the chariots of angels are colliding).THIS REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED ON [...]\n", "val": 0.015627577900886536}

{"text": "I thought Josh's last album was a step down from his tremendous debut and Closer albums which had the perfect songs and styles for an operatic voice like Groban.  But Awake still had quite a few great songs on it!  The new CD I do like Bells Of New York, well written and I like the background music and instrumentation.  Galileo is also a pretty classical sounding tune which also makes great use of the voice.  But Lora Delladdio is pretty typical mundane sounding.  The single Hidden Away now I'm sorry but this sounds formula all the way, like a pop song and nothing at all special for Groban.  The parts are repeated over and over and other than his voice changing in a higher tune, the song just isn't anything special!  Higher Window is even more formula sounding than Hidden Away, SAME TYPE OF SONG!  NOTHING like When You say You Love Me, You Raise Me Up, To Where You Are, Let Me fall, or even from the last CD So She Dances!  If I Walk Away is better Josh's voice, a banjo, more stripped down than usual but still a nice song!  Love Only Knows is a boring English song, not a song worthy of his voice AT ALL!  The rest of the CD after that sounds like filler to me, cuts that shouldnt have even made the CD except for the last song Illuminations Straight To You which is alright, a nice production on that song but still doesn't live up to those beautiful masterpieces and soaring vocals on the great classic songs I mentioned.  Josh Groban has an incredible voice  he just isn't writing or choosing the material that is worthy of it.  he should sing other writers songs, classics, or like he did in his early career singing songs that other people wrote or have even sung before.  I would be really surprised if Illuminations went double platinum like Awake did.  I think he would have done better with a 2nd Christmas album than this!\n", "val": 0.000196021021110937}

{"text": "I'll be honest: the first time I heard the entire length of Josh Groban's new album \"Illuminations\", I was disappointed. I kept waiting for the big orchestral entrance, the explosion of percussion, the big sound I was used to - and the big sound never came. This album is quite a departure from what Groban did on his first three albums, but the change isn't all bad. It's one of those records that grows on you with time. After listening to it straight for a few days, I've come to the conclusion that this may, in fact, be Josh's best work.\"Illuminations\" is about subtlety. If you enjoyed the soaring chorus and thunderous explosion of his past hits 'You Raise Me Up' or 'You are Loved (Don't Give Up)', you may want to listen to this one first. It begins with a piano prelude that reminds me of 'Life in Technicolour' from Coldplay's \"Viva la Vida\". Immediately after is 'Bells of New York City', a dark tune that wouldn't be out of place in a Dickensian Christmas film. Also dark is 'Au Jardin des Sans-Pourquoi', though if you look at the lyrics (either read French or translate them), it's obvious why. At the same time, despite its weight, it does have somewhat of a soaring chorus.The best songs on the album are the ones Josh leaked onto YouTube early: the first single, 'Hidden Away', is about coming out of your shell, and has a soaring high point toward the end, despite the lack of percussion. 'Higher Window' is about lost love, while 'L'Ora Dell'Addio' is about the pain of leaving someone behind. My favorite track is the romantic 'Voc Existe Em Mim', which is the only track with strong percussion. Also incredible is 'War at Home' which in many ways is the sequel to Groban's rendition of 'I'll Be Home for Christmas'.The only track I'm not a huge fan of is cover song 'Galileo (Someone Like You)', which would have sounded more at home on Josh's debut album. Compared to the rest, it's a little bland. That being said, it's still a good tune.\"Illuminations\" is quite a departure from Josh Groban's usual fare, but it's by no means a bad change. The album is subtle, but moving. Lyrically, Groban is far and above any previous work, and the melodies are mesmerizing as well. It's truly the best from Josh so far.\n", "val": 0.008375631645321846}

{"text": "I really enjoy this new album from Josh Groban. I appreciate that he is trying to experiment with song writing and venture out from the \"pop-era\" label that the general public had given him. I think that there's a realization that people don't always want crystal clear vocals and over-produced sounds. That's why groups such as Radiohead are successful, or artists like Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. While I love Josh Groban's previous albums, I prefer Rick Rubin's approach to producing rather than David Foster's. I have great respect for David Foster, but I prefer Rick Rubin's approach to Illuminations. I think he did a wonderful job helping Josh Groban expand his skills as an artist. I think that if Josh Groban continues to go down  this path, that he will gain more success and also gain new fans who may have not liked his material before. Favorites of mine from the album include: Higher Window (I don't think I could tire of listening to this song), If I Walk Away, Love Only Knows.

{"text": "This is a rather great 'departure/explorative CD' release by the talented Josh Groban, titled \"Illuminations\". This great CD is produced by the legendary Rick Rubin (Neil Diamond, Metallica, etc) & mixed by Allen Sides & Scheps : perhaps an indication for the 'departure/exploration' in this new album. The album opens with a great instrumental, \"The Wandering Kind(Prelude)\" : great violin & guitar combination song. The next 3 tracks, \"Bells Of New York City\", \"Galileo(Someone Like You)\" & \"L'ora Dell'addio\" are great 'classical music' tracks. \"Hidden Away\" is great track with great vocals by Josh Groban (JG) & beautiful melody. \"Au Jardin De Sans - Pourquoi\" is another great 'classical music' track. \"Higher Window\" is a great track : great acouistic guitar & amazing vocals by JG. \"If I Walk Away\" is a great track : great Spanish guitar & great vocals by JG. \"Love Only Knows\" is another great track with great guitar & vocals. \"Voce' Existe Em Mim\" is a solid track/gem : great drum & violin combination with great 'racy' vocals. \"Wait At Home\" is a great, slow orchestral track with great vocal 'entrance' at the start of the song. \"London Hymn\" is a okay orchestral/choir song, The closing track, \"Straight To You\" is a solid track/gem : beautiful music & great vocals. This is my favourite track from this rather 'departure album' by Josh Groban & hence the title of my review, \"Straight To You\".

But it is clear that the songs on this album were selected more to fit Josh's heart and less his voice.  So the songs on this album, as with most artists, were selected to communicate rather than exemplify; that is what other artists get to do, so why not Josh? As fans, we have gotten used to songs that highlight Josh' voice, but apparently not songs that communicates what Josh wanted to say.  A few songs, Higher Window, Follow Me, the War at Home, are INCREDIBLY powerful, you can't help but listen to them over and over and over.  The emotion that comes through is stunning.  So I say...YOU GO JOSH!I do have one criticism.  The orchestra almost overpowers Josh in some of the songs, which is a shame.

The best part is the last 2 to 3 songs which blend absolutely beautiful but are way out there.  I know Josh wants to show his hip young side,too.  That's o.k. if he experimented with that on a separate c.d.  But, he also needs to be realistic about where his talent really belongs.Rick Rubin didn't do anything for Josh.  He's not educated enough for Josh's genre. I think that's why he let Josh have so much control.  Josh is still in the learning stages of producing and needed the guidance of someone like David Foster.  Yes, Foster is overkill and Josh wants more independence. But, I think he could have demanded that of Foster like Michael Buble did.  Some of these songs are too philosophical, sometimes a bit corney, and the lyrics are sometimes hard to follow even after reading the words.I wanted so much to see Josh in concert this time around. But, I couldn't bear to sit thru a concert of this c.d.  It just isn't a Grammy winner.  Like the cliche says, \"if it's not broke don't fix it.\"  Can't tell if he wants to go broadway or pop.

There are no over lavished pieces, but each piece brings something unique and meaningful to this album.The best part about this album is that it's practically written by Josh Groban himself. Most of the English songs are written by Josh, and with that, one can tell he put all his effort and passion into each of his songs. This album stripped off all the fluff of the previous albums and fans are just left with Josh, and a light orchestra in the background.

In addition to that, it shows just how much he has grown as an artist, even since \"Awake\": he also wrote/cowrote most of the songs, which i think it astounding, because you don't often see that. Favorite songs include: \"The Wandering Kind\" (I thought it was neat that Josh included a purely instrumental piece on his album; we haven't seen that yet from him!); \"Bells of New York City\" (this is second only to \"Hidden Away\" as my favorite on this album; it's beautiful!); \"L'Ora Dell'Addio\"; \"Hidden Away,\" of course (I have loved this since he released it on his site); \"Higher Window\"; \"Voce Existe Em Mim\"; and \"London Hymn\" (though I thought it was almost too short, I really liked the cathedral-feel of this song). I have been waiting since \"Awake\" was released for another album, and counting down to November 15th since he announced the release date, and I am definitely not disappointed!\n", "val": 0.05442067235708237}

{"text": "This album sucks!  I could blather on about how great Josh's voice is, how heartfelt and profound his compositions are, the angst of finding love and still could not come up with a decent enough excuse for this turd of a CD.  The Grobanites posting the orgasmic reviews of this CD are either doing so out of misguided love and loyalty for their curly haired cutie pie or they are simply deaf.I'm not one to expect any artist to sing the same old stuff album after album.  Josh definitely stretched his singing chops with the work he did with Lady Blacksmith Mambazo and the cool, hip, jazz piece \"Machine\" all from Closer.  Now that was cool.  It wasn't the same old Power Ballads that made him famous or the Foster Sugar Schlock.  But Illuminations makes it difficult to believe that Josh spent five years slaving over musical compositions and arrangements and the best he could come up with was this piece of crap.  What's even more ballsy is the price of the \"Internet Edition\" he's selling on his exclusive fan club.  $39.99 for this plus two additional digital downloads.  And why not?  The four to five star reviews posted just here proves that he can clear his throat and his devoted Grobanites will applaud him.What this album sounds like is that Josh goofed off for five years and told his fans he was slaving over the bestest-ever-in-the-world-CD-just-for-them and he knows they're stupid enough to believe him.  At the last minute, he moves to New York, putters about and then pukes up some whining, whinging, angst-ridden, lonely-in-New-York-looking-for-love pabulum that only Grobanites find palatable.Groban is better than this.\n", "val": 9.545606008032337e-05}

It is not surprising to see  1-3 star reviews for this album.We're answering the wrong questions.It's not ....  DO WE LIKE JOSH?More rather.....

Who did he meet on that journey? I have to say my favorites are Bells of New York City, London Hymn and Straight To You. I keep listening to London Hymn and Straight To You on repeat.By the way, I've never heard Josh do a song like London Hymn before. It gave me the chills - it was downright beautiful.

Galileo is so beautifully melodic - reminds me of a Broadway musical.  L'Ora Dell'Addio gives me goosebumps (and tears) and Wandering Kind is brilliant - but too short! Josh composed that piece when he was 12 years old.  I want more!  His true fans have waited a long time for this body of work, and they are NOT disappointed!

It isn't one I pop in often or with excitement when I want to hear the three or four songs I like.  A few of the songs could have easily been on a Foster produced CD and been fine but not all together on one CD. One particular song stands out but as the one I intensely dislike which I won't name so people can form their own opinions but I've read other reviews that didn't like it, either. It tortures me to say it but some lyrics just aren't good. Overall, some songs I like but none I can say I love. Whereas David Foster tended towards overproduction and overkill, Rick Rubin has the exact opposite problem, not enough input. This all being said, it's still Josh Groban singing and that's a far sight better than some of the stuff that's passed off as singing these days. Sorry, Josh.\n", "val": 3.886062404490076e-05}
{"text": "The alarm has been sent out in Grobania for his fans to come here and boost the rating of this CD so I thought I'd add my review as well. Thank you snow white for pointing me here.If these same songs had been sprinkled in small doses within other more traditional Josh Groban songs sung in traditional rich baritone as he did on Closer and even to the degree of Awake they would go down easier but a whole CD of them. UGH.Josh Groban is a fantastic singer!!! Stripped down or Fosterized (which can also get tiresome) makes no difference. Josh Groban's taste in writing, however,  is too outside my taste in listening. I think he did capture in his lyrics the angst of looking for love but the musical presentations of those lyrics is all over he place and very lacking in melodious flow. I think I might like the CD, even if it is full of \"diary confessional\" songs, if the presentations was better. Unlike others, knowing his heart is not a thrill for me. I'm looking to buy music that I, the consumer, enjoy. I have loved his acoustic covers of other people's writing (America, Arms of an Angel, Play Me - check for this on youtube) because the melodies were good so my not liking this CD is not because I am pining for the bombastic as some insist? No. I'm pining for well written and well delivered songs.  Am I looking for his rich baritone?  You betcha!  Enough with the falsetto! Others can do falsetto but only Josh Groban can deliver the warm, rich, hot fudge baritone that made him the star that he now is. I think Josh Groban strayed and STAYED too far out of his lane on this one. Hopefully, next CD will be a better balance and he will include more songs in the style that made him stand out from the crowd in the first place.\n", "val": 5.9070258430438116e-05}

{"text": "Josh Groban is perhaps one of today's greatest influences in modern classical music (or classical crossover). He is highly musical and experimental, which I appreciate in any artist from any genre. His rich baritone voice envelopes you completely and even if the songs weren't incredible (which for the most part they are), his voice alone would be worth listening to. The likes of Paul Potts and Il Divo can't hope to compete.He made a name for himself after he broke onto the scene at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City where he performed \"The Prayer\" with Charlotte Church. His debut album was a huge success and his second album \"Closer\" contained the masterpieces \"You Raise Me Up\" and \"Remember When It Rained\" among others. 2005's \"Awake\" saw Josh beginning some experimentation into different musical styles. He enlisted the creative help of some of greatest musical talents, including Imogen Heap, Herbie Hancock, Five for Fighting's John Ondrasik. His Christmas album \"Noel\", released in 2008, went on to become one of the best-selling albums of both 2008 and 2009.Illuminations is his much-anticipated fifth studio album and, as is his custom, Josh gives us a new sound that is distinctly Groban, but unlike anything we've heard from him before. I would describe it as classical singer-songwriter. There are tracks that are beautifully orchestrated (no surprise since some of it is done by James Newton-Howard). But then there are simple acoustic tracks with piano, mandolin, acoustic guitar, and some strings. No drums. That's right. Only one or two tracks feature drums, and even then they are not drum sets, but orchestral drums. Josh wanted to give us music that would be fitting in Carnegie Hall but also give us the intimacy of a club. Even though it might not be brimming with energy and creativity, the result is perhaps Josh's most musical and talented work to date.I bought the deluxe edition from iTunes which comes with the original 13 tracks, one bonus track, a music video, and an interactive digital pamphlet in which Josh offers commentary on each of the tracks. So I might grab a few quotes from him while telling you about the individual songs.1. The Wandering Kind (Prelude)- This is a purely instrumental song written by Josh when he was twelve or thirteen that he's been playing his whole life but never recorded. According to him, lyrics were attempted but it just didn't seem to work, so it was just recorded as an instrumental with Josh on piano accompanied by ukelele, accordion, guitar, and strings. It has almost a Celtic feel to it and, even though it is unconventional Groban, serves as a great intro to the album.2. Bells of New York City- Josh is completely in love with NYC and this song serves as sort of his love song to it. To him, the music reminds him of the city and its people. The piano creates a bell-like sound as Josh is supported by a Carnegie-worthy orchestra. .3. Galileo (Someone Like You)- This is a love song seen from the eyes of a scientist. According to Josh, it shows you a man who is \"experiencing something so grand in a very simple way\". Musically, it sounds like something you would hear on Broadway.4. L'ora Dell'Addio- Perhaps the most classical-sounding track of the album, this is something you would hear in a huge concert hall. It is very grand and sweeping and Josh's vocal performance is flawless.5. Hidden Away- This is the album's first single. It has a beautiful melody and is gorgeously and simply executed. It's about not keeping your love to yourself and letting letting your light shine, so to speak. One of my personal favorites of the album.6. Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourqouis- A beautiful French track. Again, it is grand and sweeping, but in a more romantic and sensitive way.7. Higher Window- This is my favorite track of the album. It is very emotional and very well-written. It is about a relationship that is sinking but not beyond hope. The arrangement is brilliant. Every time I hear it I'm in awe of its perfection. If you don't listen to any other track, please check this one.8. If I Walk Away- This song is not brilliant, but not altogether forgettable. A great vocal performance from Josh, this track employs interesting arrangement choices, including a gospel choir, hammer dulcimer, and, as always, beautiful orchestration.9. Love Only Knows- A raw, intimate song about whether a relationship is meant to continue, at times it is incredibly poetic and insightful, but at times it lacks in both flow and creativity with the songwriting and arrangement. Not one of my favorites, but Josh does a fine job.10. Voce Existe Em Mim- Josh experiments with a totally new sound for him: Portugese lyrics and a heavy dose of Brazillian tribal drums. The result is mind-blowing. Definitely my favorite foreign language track. It is packed with energy and adventure that is so refreshing after the beautiful, but slow songs that precede it on the album.11. War at Home- This song was inspired by Josh's visit to Walter Reed Hospital where he met children who were injured or disabled from war. He was very moved by the experienced that he immediately blogged about it and consequently wrote the lyrics to this song. The melody is perhaps one of the best on the album. I can see it being a good singer-songwriter song for a solo acoustic guitar, but the orchestral arrangement, especially the choir, is very effective.12. London Hymn- A short choral piece composed by Josh and Marius de Vries (collaborated on Remember When It Rained and Machine) while in a hotel in London, this is a step into uncharted territory for Josh. While some might not be especially impressed with the opera choir, I give him credit for trying something new. At just under two minutes, it's the shortest track of the album.13. Straight to You- A song written and originally recorded by Nick Cave, this is perhaps the most beautiful moment on the album. The lyrics have such a simple poetry which works beautifully with the music. James Newton-Howard does the orchestration and you feel if Josh's voice were taken out, this would belong to the most emotional scene of a film. I don't think I've ever anything by Josh that is as beautiful as this. It could make you cry from sheer exposure to such beauty.14. Feels Like Home (Bonus Track from Deluxe Edition)- If you bought the regular album, you'll want to go to iTunes and download this song. Yes, it is the same song you heard in the film \"My Sister's Keeper\". Originally written by Randy Newman and newly arranged and orchestrated by James Newton-Howard, this version is brilliantly crafted to flawlessly combine Josh's rich voice and intimate instrumentation. The lyrics are melancholy and bittersweet. Simply a stroke of genius.On the Deluxe iTunes version is also the music video for Hidden Away (Radio Edit). The video itself is not extraordinary, but I really like the Radio Edit of the song. It's tastefully done and takes the song from a simple and intimate sound to a more mainstream sound which works very well. I hope it will be released as a single soon.Overall, I'm very surprised and delighted at the turn Josh has taken. He knows he's very musical and his fan base is largely accepting of classical music so he created a new sound. Some might call it playing it safe instead of branching more into the pop genre, but the industry is filled with that. I think Josh was daring in pursuing a simpler, intimate style and I think he really pulled it off brilliantly. It might not have been what I was expecting or even hoping for, but I give props to Josh for expanding his musical horizons. I do feel as far as musicality goes, while the arrangement is usually simple, the melodies and harmonies are the most complex and creative he's put out. Josh had his writing hand in most of these songs and I think it goes to prove that Josh is no longer the young vocalist performing covers or songs others have written for him. While still one of the world's greatest vocalists first and foremost, Josh has now evolved into a true artist of music.\n", "val": 0.04145880788564682}
{"text": "When I first listened to Josh's new CD, I sorta went \"huh\"?  It had such a different quality electronically; it is not as \"slick\" or produced a sound as I have become used to hearing.  It is much more live and honest quality, which I think is what Josh and Rick Rubin were shooting for.I find the opening instrumental \"Wandering Kind\" fun!  Not grand, just plain fun!Songs that have become my favorites: the classical sound of L'ora Dell'Addio, the driving beat of Voce Existe Em Mim with the superb drum corp, the patriotic homage in War At Home (this one makes me tear up) and Hidden Away (although I've heard the radio mix and like it a bit better.  I like Higher Window a lot and enjoy the folksy feel to If I Walk Away.  Since I have done a lot of choral singing in Latin, I appreciate London Hymn for what it is, but it's not really my very favorites.  I think the jury is still out with me on Galileo (although the lyrics are intriguing) and the cover of Straight To You.Just like most of his albums, there are those songs that grab you immediately and some that grow on you after further listening and studying.  Maybe this album requires more study that his earlier ones.  But I truly like this album and appreciate the direction to which Josh detoured.

{"text": "I was not sure what to think about this album. It is a huge departure from the variety of classical and international sound of his previous albums. I was excited when he announced that he was realeasing a fourth album. The singles he released earlier, \"Voc Existe Em Mim\", \"Hidden Away\", \"L'Ora Dell'Addio\", and \"Higher Window\" were all equally gorgeous, well-crafted and were among his best songs yet, especially \"Voc Existe Em Mim\" in particular. I had a feeling that the rest of the album was going to be just as superb, unqiue, and full of variety. Imagine my suprise when I listened to all the songs and found it entirely unexpected and different.Overall it it a first rate album with a very strong and almost formal sound. It definitely the most contemporary of his albums as well as his more personal as he wrote or co-produced most of the songs. I just don't like that almost all the songs sound the same and somewhat monotonous. The reason I loved his previous work was the variety of styles which ranged from classical to experiemental. My favorite aspect of his music is the way he brings out the beauty of the Italian language (\"Canto Alla Vita\", \"Oceano\",\"Per Te\", \"Un Girono Per Noi\", \"Caruso\", \"Mi Mancherai\" etc.), all of which are my favorite songs by Josh and the what first drew me to his music. I could always count on Josh to include and showcase international styles of music, such as African and jazz with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Vusi Mahlasela, and Herbie Hancock in Awake and his collaboration with experimental French band Deep Forest in \"Never Let Go\" on Closer.I felt that this album was terrbily lacking that exploration and crossover of genres that he had become known for as this album seems has more a solely contemporary and more unified sound that is humdrum and dragging along at the same time.It goes without saying that my favorite track obviously from this album was the Portugese \"Voc Existe Em Mim\" which seems to be the only international song along with drums, a unqiue feature I have always looked forward to in Josh's work ever since I listened to \"Canto Alla Vita\" and his cover of Linkin Park's \"My December\".My second favorite was \"L'Ora Dell'Addio\" which is majestic and soaring, but remains the sole staple of any Italian music on this album.Everything else consisted of some fresh and new contemporary elements ranging from formal on the orchestral song \"London Hymn\", a lot of love songs (every other song), a self composed song in French called \"Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourquoi\", and covers of English/Irish artists such as Declan O'Rourke's \"Galileo\" and Nick Cave's \"Straight to You.\"It is still a good album even though it is definitely different and far from what I have come to expect from Josh.

There is no other way to say it --- I'm just really disappointed.When I started out listening to this new album I was really excited in anticipation of Josh's great voice and lots of beautiful new songs. Well, that excitement and anticipation didn't last very long. It became clear after listening to just the first few songs that this album would be very, very different from his previous albums \"Closer\" and \"Awake\". Now, change doesn't necessarily have to be bad, but in this case it really is!Half the songs sound like they were taken from a bad Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, the other half sounds ... I'm not even sure how best to put it --- too classical, maybe? Not classical in the same sense as some of the songs on \"Closer\" or \"Awake\" were (those albums boasted some really wonderful classical-sounding songs), but classical in the sense of \"so boring I'm about too fall asleep\". There is nothing that stands out about any of the songs on this album --- they are completely bland and interchangeable!By now I have listened to this entire album several times, for the simple reason that I know that sometimes you have to hear a song (or album) more than once before you start liking it. In this case, however, I'm sorry to say that the songs do not improve with age, so to speak. In fact, there is not a single song on the entire CD that I really like, and that is something I never  thought I would EVER say about a Josh Groban CD!!!I love, love, LOVE all of Josh's previous CDs, but where \"Illuminations\" is concerned I simply can't believe I actually paid money for this album ... :o(Two stars for Josh's still-fantastic voice and the few halfway decent songs on the album, but that's all I can give here ...\n", "val": 3.959973037126474e-05}

{"text": "Josh Groban has clearly taken time to choose just the material he wants to showcase his abilities and delight his listeners with \"Illuminations.\" He sings with warmth, grace and dexterity, not to mention technical precision and prowess that cannot be credibly argued against.Some prefer a singer who show signs of exertion when they perform. Josh Groban is not that kind of singer. His technical gift is so obvious and great that he never seems to break a sweat. He runs the risk of seeming less than sincere or earnest as a result, since he so obviously never has to reach high to achieve terrific results, which he does here.Fortunately, the songs are often very strong - and his enthusiasm for them so great - that getting lost in his rich, lyrical baritone is inevitable from a single spin.He soars especially on the non-English material. \"L'Oro D'ell Addio\" is wall to wall high-flying rapture, with Groban's voice going deeply low and marvelously high with undiluted grace and beauty. \"Au Jardin Des-Sans Pourquoi\" is similar, with seamless, breathtaking orchestration and Groban's impassioned vocals pouring over it like melted butter.He will not be recording duets with Rihanna or Katy Perry anytime soon.A couple English tunes stand out because they are, succinctly, not good enough.  They sound pleasant - everything Groban has wrapped his voice around is worth hearing - but it is hard not to feel that they are a waste of his sprawling talent. He sounds remarkably invested in \"Higher Window,\" which is gorgeously orchestrated and arranged, but its lyrics border on banal and its melody is not imaginative or engaging. The same goes for \"Hidden Away,\" which sounds formulaic and predictable, even if his voice is -indeed - stunning and huggably warm.He does display imagination as a song writer on \"War at Home,\" which focuses on domestic troubles without sounding trite or earthbound. It is not jarring, even as it as immediately follows the uncontainable, deadly serious \"Voce Existe en Mim,\" a Portugese tune.\"Straight to You\" is epic and grandiose without sounding stuffy or insincere - a heartrending finale that finishes the disc ideally.Fans of Groban will relish this album and wear it out like an old cliche. True, not every tune is worthy of his pipes, but then that sets the standards unfairly high. Voices like his are rare, and song by song \"Illuminations\" proves that.\n", "val": 0.014696145430207253}
{"text": "Josh Groban has always been a great singer.  What is really amazing is that after years of voice lessons he is noticeably better.  How could he improve what was already so great?  He managed.  Everything is clearer, purer, richer, better executed.  His lowest notes used to be his downfall & he sometimes struggled with them, but no more.  His higher range notes sound more relaxed, more powerful, clearer.  Unbelievable.  The one oddity, for a near-operatic baritone, is that he relies a great deal on falsetto, which sometimes works well, but not always.The sound on this album is just crystal clear, clean, awesome.  I've never heard anything sound so clean.Josh wrote 11 of the songs on this album, mostly with collaborators.  This is more than he's written before.  The songs include quite a bit of variety, with some sounding distinctly classical, others sounding more like folk ballads, and one (\"The War At Home\") sounding just a little bit country-ish.  The lyrics and sound are generally moving and thought provoking.The album is missing some of the more avante-guarde elements of some of his earlier albums -- and generally comes off as more traditional -- and yet not traditional.  His melodies always take unexpected twists.  His voice makes unexpected shifts in timbre.  Just as you think you're in familiar territory musically, suddenly you're not.  But the stuff he did with Mouquet and Heap in the past were more experimental, which is the one thing I really miss on this album, though \"Voce Existe in Mim\" has a bit of the quality of those prior works of Josh's.In the past, I saw him as part of an international community of fusionists who were working to fuse elements of all sorts of music together to form new sounds.  I saw him as the first mainstream new music composer; but this album isn't like that so much.  Its newness is more subtle.  It does not really sound like anything else that's been out there before, while not using any exotic elements.Josh is profoundly creative, one of the most revolutionary forces in music today, a real genius -- one who picks up the torch of classical music and moves it in new directions.  And, yet, there is that hypnotic singability of some of the choruses.Josh considers this to be essentially a \"live\" album.  Many songs were \"one take.\"  And, yet, you don't notice.  It is all apparently flawless.Instruments: predominantly piano and stringsComments about some individual songs -- all having a rich and soaring sound, BTW:Wandering kind: an instrumental piece composed by Josh when he was 12, with added musicians.  Complex, beautiful, cheerfulBells of New York City: minor, mournfulGalileo:  A cover of an Irish song by Declan O'Rourke.  This is the one song I find annoying on here.  While a pretty song, it takes as its theme bemusement at the idea of a scientist falling in love and not finding a scientific explanation for his feelings.  As a scientist, I find this offensive, as it seems to imply that scientists are not naturally human and that it's odd for us to be just like everyone else.L'Ora Dell'Adio: the most operatic of these pieces.  It really show cases the maximum magnificence of Josh's voice.  Lyrics in Italian.Hidden Away: the first released single of which there is an official music video featuring Miss Kentucky 2009.  This starts out with a very sweet, pop-like tone, but deteriorates into a sequence with many rough transitions between baritone and falsetto.  This is not my favorite one of the songs musically, but it's starting to grow on me.  It has a very nice message about trying to be positive and loving, rather than keeping warmth inside.Au Jardin de sans pourquoi:  I find this one particularly beautiful, though he does have a tendency to go back and forth over the same interval a lot.  Lyrics in French.  one of the few where Josh wrote the music alone, though it's considered a \"cover\" of another piece, presumably because of the words)Higher Window:  a very beautiful, but sad love song about a man who may have missed his chance after initially rejecting a woman.If I Walk Away:  This is a love song with a very catchy & singable chorus.  A fun one.Love Only Knows: Another one with a very catchy and singable chorus -- very hard to get out of my head, but leaving me with a feeling that this guy is ultimately going to get hurt.Voce Existe in Mim:  This is my personal favorite.  It has a huge sound with very unusual sequences, where the voice is not so dominant and the instrumentals are very strong.  This is probably the most experimental sounding one, and features a large all female drumming group.  Lyrics in Portuguese.War at Home: This one has a slight hint of country sound.  It's about soldiers who have suffered in war.  Josh wrote this after a visit to Walter Reed Hospital.  It's very, very moving -- very hard to get out of my head.  I predict that this is going to be the most popular out of this album.London Hymn: This is heavy on the instrumentals, with Josh blending in, very orchestral and choral. In Latin.Straight to You: a cover of a rock song by Nick Cave.  Well, if you're a rock fan, you won't like it.  If you're a pop/classical fan, you wouldn't like the original and will like this one much better.---------------------AddendumAfter listening to this at least five more times now, I am struck by a pervasive sadness about the thing.  It sounds like Josh's love life hasn't been going very well.  There is a sense of yearning in all the songs -- of pain, really.  Josh is such a clown in his spoken life, and sometimes he wonders why people think he is so serious, but the music sounds very serious, almost grim.--------------------Second AddendumIn his \"Before We Begin\" concert at Union Chapel, Josh explained that \"London Hymn\" was written in London, shortly after he wrote \"The War at Home.\"  It is a sort of quiet requiem piece that has afterthoughts about his visit to Walter Reed Hospital.-----------------Third addendumIn his \"Before We Begin\" concert in Toronto, Jan. 13, Josh explained that \"Au jardin des sans pourquoi\" had lyrics written by Rufus Wainwright and his mother, both of whom are or were noted songwriters. though Josh wrote the music .  At one of the \"Before We Begin\" concerts, Wainright came up to ask if the song had made it onto the record.  It turned out it was the only song he had written with his mother and she had died shortly thereafter.----------------Fourth addendum:I saw a recent interview where Josh said that \"If I Walk Away\" was written to his parents and other people in his life who keep him grounded -- to encourage them to continue keeping him grounded.\n", "val": 0.013904228806495667}

{"text": "The All American Nightmare album foreshadows its own place among the classic rockers to whom it pays tribute.  The musical allusions in PUT THAT RECORD ON could serve as a Foundations of Rock 101 survey, and Hinder stands shoulder to shoulder with the masters.  STRIPTEASE, which is sure to ignite a flurry of speculation, and HEY HO both effectively dismiss the overly glitzed, media grubbing antitheses of rock, while WHAT YA GONNA DO and THE LIFE take an introspective turn and deliver a poignant assessment of making choices and living with them.  In what may be the sleeper track of the album, EVERYBODY'S WRONG gives a voice to those who have taken the heat, bared the load, and weathered the storm of being in a relationship with a disingenuous fraud.  The title track, ALL AMERICAN NIGHTMARE is a blatant, no-apologies proclamation, yet it also plays like a political anthem, and one could easily imagine it blaring from the speakers of an Apache chopper destined for enemy soil.  Anyone with a sense of humor and a penchant for satire will appreciate BAD MF.

The word that summarizes this CD is probably disappointing. The hard rocking riffs and sexual lyrics are still there, but gone are the infectious melodies. Some of the songs stick with you, one of them being the first single \"All American Nightmare.\" However, their previous albums churned out song after song of infectious melodies, songs like How Long, Up All Night, and Loaded and Alone stayed in my head for days. Plus, the previous albums had several beautiful songs such as Lips of an Angel and Without You. Unfortunately, the beauty and infectiousness of the previous albums are lost in this one. It's still worth buying, but I wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for it.\n", "val": 7.823701889719814e-05}
{"text": "I have been a fan of Hinder for quite some time now. I have loved everything from Far From Close to Take It To The Limit. This album, it is my hopes, will take the charts by storm. I believe that nearly every track on this album could be worthy of being a radio single. This album is by far, is an unbelievable follow-up to Take It To The Limit, and completely exceeded my expectations.Along with Led Zeppelin and Motley Crue, I will oftentimes listen to Hinder in the same setting. Hinder is the most under-rated and talented band I have ever come to encounter. I just met Austin earlier tonight in Connecticut, and had him sign the new album. They are a bunch of great guys, and should really be recognized for their talent to bring 80's influence to a modern audience.\n", "val": 0.012946244329214096}
{"text": "OK, their first release was great, their second was a bit of a disappointment.  Could Hinder get back on track?  The answer is yes, this is a much better disc than I was expecting.  It was so good, I went back and bought it here after I listened to it from the internet!What is most interesting is how two songs, based on their titles, are nothing like you would expect.  When I saw titles like \"Hey Ho\" and \"Striptease\" I thought, oh wow, more anthems for strippers.... how unique.  In fact, these songs are not like that at all.  \"Hey Ho\" is a really funny song about how the singer loves to rock and the chick he is with wants to listen to hip-hop.  Lines like \"Take Little Wayne out of my player, please\" are hilarious.  And striptease is about how all these little pop tarts are nothing more than sex objects who cannot sing; according to Hinder, we would \"respect you more if you just took off your clothes\", and \"I can only listen to you in a magazine\".  Great stuff!The real winner here, though, is Put That Record On.  That is the reason I bought the disc, it is SUCH a good song.  We all here a good ol' rock tune that takes us back in the day.  Hinder gets 10 stars on this song, they nail it.Good job, boys!  I support you with my dollars, hope others do likewise.\n", "val": 0.0202099047601223}
{"text": "I am a huge Hinder fan. They've always had lyrics I have been able to relate to. This one is no exception. Don't be fooled by their first single (All American Nightmare) because even though it is great for fist pumping, like other Hinder albums, the first single is far from their best. My person favorite is Hey Ho ripping on rap music. Another good one is Striptease, ripping on untalented pop women. How can you go wrong? Put That Record on is a reminiscence of classic rock and you will hear TONS of references if you are even sort of into classic rock. Lastly, Everybody's Wrong is going to be their next Lips of an Angel/Without You type of ballad song that will hit the Top 40 stations HARD. My advice is to buy the album and then avoid the top 40 stations once Everybody's Wrong hits the radio.\n", "val": 5.595167021965608e-05}

For the most part, this is nothing like their older music. I personally did not enjoy it, but there may be those of you out there who will if you're looking for that southern-rock style, or thought that Hinder was too mainstream before.I'm not saying it's bad or good. I'm just saying that you cannot buy this album based on previous Hinder albums that you liked. Check it out first. Borrow it from a friend if you have to.

{"text": "This album is a surprise! I heard the 1st two songs and liked them and was after that, I was kinda expecting hair metal, a.k.a. not a very impressive or good album (besides the 1st two songs). What I got was an amazing Southern Rock record! This album sounds as good as the cover looks (literally :). Austin Winker has a good voice! He kinda reminds me of the 80's hair metal bands, but way better. And as for the band?: They are great!The Music:Again, this is a bit of Hair Metal mixed with some Southern Rock/Metal. Sounds original to my ears.1. \"2 Sides of Me\"- A very heavy rocker. I really like the sound of this song. It's very creative and I like the chorus of it. Great song!2. \"All American Nightmare\"- Another heavy rocker. This one is also very creative and cool. This is very Hair Metal-like because it just fits the description of Hair Metal in every way: music style, subject matter, and vocal style. Very good, though.3. \"What Ya Gonna Do\"- A nice slower rock song. It seems like a nice little anthem for a concert and I like this one a lot. Good little tune.4. \"Hey Ho\"- This is a fun little tune. I like the beat of it and it, as pointed out by another reviewer, it has very humorous lyrics about the guy's girl friend liking hip-hop/rap and him being a rocker. With a line like \"Take your Kanye out of my player please, that Zepplin 45 is stayin' with me\". It's a great rock song with humor!5. \"The Life\"- A nice little ballad. I really think this ballad is good. These guys wrote it beautifully.6. \"Waking Up the Devil\"- This song sounds good, but even so, I just like it slightly less than the rest of the songs. It has a nice beat but I don't know, I just don't like it as much.7. \"Red Tail Lights\"- Another Beautifully written ballad. I like this one a lot, but I like \"The Life\" more.8. \"Striptease\"- This one is a song with humorous lyrics but I just have the same problem as \"Waking Up the Devil\", it's just lacking something, but I don't know what...9. \"Everybody's Wrong\"- Another nice little ballad. However, this one isn't as good as the other 2, it's still enjoyable and good.10. \"Put That Record On\"- This one is great! I really like this one. It's about like how a certain song can make you feel. I really like it. Yes, this is an Inception type thing. LOLVerdict: This is a great album. This was my first album from them and I highly enjoy it. This is a great buy for fans of Breaking Benjamin, Warrent, and Hair Metal bands. You should buy it.\n", "val": 0.021580711007118225}

{"text": "Hinder scores again with their most recent release as their songwriting prowess reaches new heights.  Two songs which should be future hard-rock classics, but haven't gotten any airplay as far as I know, are Put that Record On and What Ya Gonna Do.  As far as I'm concerned, Put that Record On is the best song the band has ever written.  In it, Hinder pays homage to many of their rock influences by cleverly weaving in shout outs to bands such as ACDC(Back in Black), Aerosmith(Walk this Way), Motley Crue(Home Sweet Home), Led Zeppelin(The Song Remains the Same) Bob Segar(Turn the Page)and others.  What Ya Gonna Do is one heck of a catchy tune about life in a band after the spotlight and glory fades.  The song is very ironic as it appears Hinder's fame is waning.  Other highlights include the commercially appealling Red Tail Lights and hard-rocking Waking up the Devil.  If you enjoyed Hinder's previous efforts then this album would be well worth the purchase.  It is solid throughout.\n", "val": 0.035069212317466736}

To me, these are probably the best tracks on this work artistically speaking. Great to listen to over and over. Three serious and powerful tunes, especially What Ya Gonna Do and Everybody's Wrong, while Waking Up The Devil is more on the party side. Striptease is a rocker with sly lyrics and a little humor. Put That Record on is nostalgic and \"hits the spot\" with the mention of many songs/albums many of us grew up with.

Many original fans of the band complain they forgot their roots, however, I am more than thrilled with their journey into melodic sounding metal.All American Nightmare boasts a pretty decent set of hard rock songs, but like most modern American bands, Hinder rely heavily on ballads for radio play. I can't damn the guys for this course, everybody knows hard rock radio would sooner crank out Rooster, or Smells Like Teen Spirit every ten seconds, before they would play some newer bands like Crashdiet or Hardcore Superstar. My favorites from the album are Striptease, 2 Sides 2 Me, All-American Nightmare, Hey Ho and Put That Record On.I really recommend this record to any fan of hard rock music, and if you have never given Hinder a listen because you thought they were too modern sounding, give All American Nightmare a listen.\n", "val": 0.02355862967669964}

{"text": "\"All American Nightmare\" is the 3rd studio album by US rock band \"Hinder\" released in December 2010. The line up features lead singer Austin Winkler, guitarists Joe Garvey and Mark King, bassist Mike Rodden and drummer Cody Hanson. Before moving into further details, allow me to comment on the beautiful cover artwork featuring model Jesse Lee Denning.On the preceding album \"Take it to the limit\", \"Hinder\" took a considerably old school turn in their music by inducing elements of 80s rock, rebalancing their whole sound which one found really appealing. On that basis I was really looking forward to purchasing their new album \"All American Nightmare\".  Upon first play it becomes clear that the old school element is still very much alive on the new album, only this time have placed more emphasis on grooves/rhythm rather than melody.  For that matter \"...Nightmare\" is built on American rock'n roll at times touching blues rock; still in terms of production, the new album is probably the thickest sounding \"Hinder\" release to date-that has everything to do with star producer Kevin Churko (\"Ozzy\") who is known for thick productions, maximizing the effect of guitars and vocals in the mix.I have to comment that the overall artistic approach on \"...Nightmare\" proves a successful attempt as it offers a fair amount of quality rockers, much like the previous albums, while reinventing a good part of their style. Favorite tracks include \"Waking up the devil\", \"All American nightmare\" and \"2Sides of me\".\n", "val": 0.007835380733013153}

The band is basically treading water and standing still when it comes to creativity and exploring new areas, as most bands do.Also not good (in my opinion), they've turned up the sleaze factor with the mangy tattooed gal on the album art, songs like \"Waking Up the Devil\", and the whole \"life's a party, get wasted, accomplish nothing, offend others, be stupid\" message that they are promoting.  It's really just big cliche, and quite laughable.Also, for those who give a flip about intelligence and grammar, there are a couple of dumb typos that make the band and CD packagers look like fools.  \"Red Tail Lights\" should be \"Red Taillights\" (it's one word dummys), and \"All American Nightmare\" should be \"All-American Nightmare\".

Someone said that this album was all about 'strippers, groupies, drinking, and partying.' For that reason, they gave it a bad review. Well, there are two things I'd like to add: it's also about consequences of a life lived in this band's style, and 'what the hell do you think rock and roll is? Love songs and intimacy?' Rock and roll is about living fast, making bad decisions in the name of a good time, and excess.All American Nightmare, to me, is the rock anthem of the year.

{"text": "While they take a beating from music critics and rock/metal snobs, there's no denying Hinder's talent for creating radio-friendly rock tunes that please the masses. I have all 3 of their major label albums and All American Nightmare is their best yet. Extreme Behavior was full of great pop-rock songs along the lines of Nickelback & other modern rock acts. Take It To The Limit brought the band's sound closer to 80s anthem rock, which I thought was fantastic. It had the guitar riffs and catchy choruses I love most about rock music.All American Nightmare merges that anthemic foundation with a bluesy, southern rock influence. As a whole it's heavier than anything Hinder has ever put out. But there are also songs that are softer than you would expect from Hinder. The result is a well-rounded album from a band that has clearly developed their own sound in today's diverse music landscape. I hope they find success with it, because I want to hear more from them.2 Sides of Me - A great way to kick things off. This song about the extremity of one's personality rocks hard and has a strong melody.All American Nightmare - The first single and, quite simply, a rock masterpiece. The vocals are fantastic with hard-driving guitars to back it up.What Ya Gonna Do - The clearest example of the album's southern rock roots. The best way to describe it is a classic Lynyrd Skynyrd song, written & performed in 2010 by Hinder.Hey Ho - A bluesy, upbeat song about the state of modern music with a catchy, singalong chorus. Just a really fun tune with relevant lyrics.The Life - One of the softer songs on the album, packed with a lot of meaning. It's also one of the more pop-friendly songs Hinder's ever done. Even though some may dislike when the band does ballads, I have to say I really enjoy when they delve into this territory.Waking Up The Devil - Sounds just as you would expect based on the title. It's dark, it's loud, and it's heavy. The guitars are haunting and the drum beat is prominent. How fitting that it was included on the Saw 3D soundtrack.Red Tail Lights - Along the same lines as Without You, this is a radio hit waiting to happen. There's a lot of emotion packed into the performance with some great lyrics. I hope this one catches on.Striptease - I couldn't be happier with this all-out attack on the likes of Lady Gaga and Ke$ha. The vocals are amazing and I can't help but notice the underlying guitar sounds are similar to Bon Jovi's \"You Give Love A Bad Name\". Of course, that makes it even better.Everybody's Wrong - Another ballad and already one of my favorite Hinder songs. It's heartfelt, real, and should absolutely be a monster hit if released to adult pop radio. The twin guitar solo is solid too.Put That Record On - I think this is the second single, which seems like a smart choice. It's a well-done tribute to classic rock, one that could have the same kind of success as Kid Rock's \"All Summer Long\". Everyone's going to be singing the chorus of this song.\n", "val": 0.04010901600122452}

I will say, once I looked up lyrics to the songs (provided they were the actual lyrics and not just someone's best guess), I enjoyed the songs that much more.

I then tried to play it in another CD player, but still nothing.  I then tried it in my DVD player and it played the songs, but didn't have any video even though there are supposed to be some videos at the end.  Trying to figure out what was going on, I put it in my computer and discovered the problem: it contained a file labeled Hinder.mov, which is a QuickTime file that will only play on a computer.  That is pretty worthless having a CD that is not actually a CD because it won't play in a CD player.  In my opinon, this product is mislabeled.  A disclaimer needs to be added that this is not an audio CD, but instead is intended only to be played on a computer.  I will be returing this \"Deluxe Edition\" and ordering the plain CD that hopefully will play in a CD player.

{"text": "\"Libra Scale\" apparently narrates different chapters in the lives of three black superheroes inspired by Ne-Yo's love of comics and sci-fi. Put all that aside and what we have is an album that is an improvement on his last \"Year Of The Gentleman\".Opening is the uptempo R&B dance song \"Champagne Life\" with echoes of Michael Jackson. Shades of Jackson show up again in the finger-snap driven ballad \"Know Your Name\" and the upbeat \"Cause I Said So\". \"Crazy Love\" features Fabolous, and with its languid feel and quivering guitars has echoes of Lauryn Hill.Other standouts are the midtempo \"Makin' A Movie\" and \"One In A Million\", the StarGate-produced swirling trancey Dance number \"Beautiful Monster\" (a UK no. 1 hit) with lovely layered harmonies (reminiscent of Rihanna's \"Russian Roulette which he co-wrote), and the beautiful falsetto-sung ballad \"What Have I Done?\" (think \"I Can't Help It\" by Michael Jackson.

{"text": "I bought this album digitally on Black Friday for two reasons - (1) Ne-Yo is at the head of the pack of young guys whose music I love so whenever I find out he's releasing new music, I get it & (2) it was $3.99 (gotta save $ where I can given my music fetish).I loved the lead single & video, CHAMPAGNE LIFE.  It is such a joyous track and makes me want to get up and dance every time I hear it.  He then quickly released BEAUTIFUL MONSTER & I hated the track so didn't quite know what to expect of the rest of the album.  I was also a little troubled by Ne-Yo's comments after the album under-performed, I have a pet peeve about artists who don't stand behind their work - it makes me feel like I wasted my $$ supporting their effort.I appreciate the comments from other posters regarding his desire to present this project as a movie so now those videos make sense. It's a shame that the label rushed him and nixed that idea because I think it could've worked - it's a concept that no one else is doing currently & the songs told a story & tied into one another but given the skittish nature of record labels these days it's unsurprising that any type of creativity is stifled while artists are pushed to create the same 'ol music as every other artist.  I also wonder if he'd gotten other promotion - like a BET or MTV \"making of\" documentary that could've reached more people to explain the concept and also to alert people that the album was dropping.I like this album a lot more than I did BECAUSE OF YOU.  The lyrics are strong as is the music production.  I love 7 out of the 10 songs so that's a great purchase in my book! Songs I keep on repeat:CHAMPAGNE LIFECRAZY LOVE - it has a similar sound to Lauryn Hill's THE SWEETEST THING but Ne-Yo definitely made the song his own.  The assist from Fabolous is terrific, his flow and lyrics perfectly match the song without overpowering itKNOW YOUR NAME, ONE IN A MILLION & TELEKINESIS (a sexy slow jam)WHAT HAVE I DONE & GENUINE ONLY - the production & vocal arrangements of each track is very Michael Jackson-esque to me.  Not a bad thing given Ne-Yo's admiration for MJMy ok tracks are CAUSE I SAID SO (an uptempo track that also reminds me of a MJ track) & MAKIN' A MOVIE (not a bad track it just didn't resonate with me the way the others did)Finally the only track I dislike is BEAUTIFUL MONSTER.As I've previously stated about other r&b artists who had disappointing sales last year - I hope that Ne-Yo doesn't jump onto a musical genre for his next album just because it's hot and abandons the audience that loves his work. This album is really good (imho) and just didn't get the promotion it deserved (like the rest of the r&b artists last year - unfortunately).\n", "val": 0.006517135072499514}
{"text": "What happened Ne-Yo? Everything he touched before this album turned to gold...But as soon as he disappeared for a brief period of time, it seems like he might have lost his touch a bit. I have always been at least a modest fan of Ne-Yo, more so when he first came out, his first two albums were great but as of lately he has wandered to far into the pop genre for me to tolerate. He still has all the talent in the world, and he still is a phenomenal song writer, but his style has changed a lot since he first came out, and Libra Scale is the first album of his that I would say was a definite miss. His last album (2008's Year of The Gentleman) was extremely successful despite being just an average album, but Libra Scale is lacking in both areas. It flopped and was his worst album by far. The production was weak (I don't recognize hardly any names on this album), the songwriting was bland, and just the overall vibe of the album was boring. There were a few standout cuts, the mellow baby maker \"Telekinesis\" and the mid tempo banger \"Makin a Movie\" both make lasting impressions, as do the singles \"Champagne Life\" and \"One in a Million\", but other than that the rest of the album is filler in my opinion. That was the biggest problem with this album, was there was a severe lack of standout material on the album, and it just didn't sound focused at all, kind of coming off half assed. I mean it's not the worst album i have ever heard by any means, if your a huge Ne-Yo fan you will still get a decent amount of enjoyment out of the album most likely, but as whole the album is definitely lacking, especially compared to some of his better work...Better luck next time Ne-Yo, i know the talent is still there, but this album just didn't display it like some of his other work...\n", "val": 1.669224184297491e-05}

{"text": "The presented track \"Champagne Life\" is a highlight song on the latest release by Ne-Yo. As always this artist expresses creativity within every song. Ne-Yo has definitely evolved from his previous albums and shows he can be a versatile singer. \"Makin' A Movie\" isn't one of his strongest tracks and really falls flat to the Ne-Yo standard. With that said, I believe if given a chance....Ne-Yo can sing the phone book, he's that good of a vocalist. In the song \"Know Your Name\", the artist sounded similar to the late Michael Jackson in some parts. Although this is the case, Ne-Yo hasn't reached the level of fame as Michael just yet. (Libra Scale) is not the best album to be released by Ne-Yo. His first two albums out shined this release by far. Ne-Yo starts off talk rapping in the track \"One in a million\" which could have been deleted without the need for excusable cause and even still this song is one of the best tracks on the album. I don't feel this album is quite ready for a Grammy nod. There is nothing special about most of the album tracks. Songs like \"Telekinesis\" and \"Genuine Only\" just falls flat for which they both have the sense of a missing link. Overall, Ne-Yo tries to come off like a pre-mature Michael Jackson but doesn't bring his latest album to justice. I call it half-steppin!

I was surprised that Ne-Yo went back to his R&B roots for the better half of his album.

He decided to release a series of extended music videos, which will run from 7-10 minutes. It's ambitious, he acknowledges, but well worth the creative and financial investment. Elaborate concepts and visual aside, at its core Libra Scale is vintage Ne-Yo: sophisticated songwriting, beautiful melodies and a voice that's as supple as it is powerful. This album should be go Platinum!\n", "val": 0.038302231580019}
{"text": "Never let it be said that NE-YO doesn't put out a consistantly enjoyable product.  That being said, LIBRA SCALE is just as good as his prior releases.  In my head, listening to tracks 8,9 & 10, these cuts could have been on a Michael Jackson disc easily.  If this was a tribute album, then it is no doubt that this man did him a lot of justice.  He stayed true to form and gave us that sound we have been accustomed to without being bored by it.  GOOD WORK, NE-YO!\n", "val": 0.04220951348543167}
{"text": "It's a good album overall. Considering it's a concept album that Ne-Yo actually wanted as a movie, but his record label pushed him to release it early under time constraints, the CD lives up to the concept. I'll say that there are 4 tracks I like out of the album:One In a MillionBeautiful MonsterChampagne LifeMakin' a MovieEverything else I couldn't follow as well as those singles I mentioned. \"Because Of You\" album was better, but \"Libra Scale\" shows a lot of experimenting with sounds which is refreshing.

{"text": "Ne-Yo is one of the most talented and maybe even underrated singers of the new generation.  He's a phenomenal writer having penned many hits for himself and others.  He's a true performer in that he can dance and dance very well.  He does not rely on gimmicks to sell his album or his talent.  On top of that he has one of the smoothest voices around that shows shades of the great Michael Jackson more often than you would like to admit.  Not to mention he has a sound that is unique to him.  However, he never really gets put in the upper echelon of singers and it's a shame.On his 4th album, Libra Scale, Ne-Yo continues to hone his craft into something worth enjoying and experiencing for many years.  The album is groovy and smooth.  At ten tracks deep, some may gripe about the length of the album but I find it to be a perfect pace and values the quality over quantity.  I like it more when artists make a conscious effort to release an effort that is focused with an overall theme rather than try throw a bunch of songs on the album just because they've been recorded.  Libra Scale is said to have a storyline but I don't really hear a clear story line throughout the album and if it's there I think it's really loose interpretation of the word story.  Maybe this story is better told through videos.There's a lot of \"sexy\" songs on this album including One In A Million, Crazy Love, Know Your Name, and the incredible Champagne Life.  There are 8 great songs on this album as I don't really care for the number one single Beautiful Monster because I think it's wack. As many know from my other reviews, I'm not too fond of the whole obligatory European night club techno song that has invaded R&B and Soul artists' albums.  Even though I do find the video to make the song better, I find the actual song unnecessary and forced.  When a talent like Ne-Yo can create Champagne Life then he doesn't need Beautiful Monster.  That right there is my opinion on the matter.  Also Cause I Said So is not a great track either.Ne-Yo's Libra Scale is an album that is definitely worth adding to the collection.  It's well produced, written, and performed and the songs are highly enjoyable.  A few missteps prevent this from being a classic but as it stands it's still an extremely good album.  If you've liked Ne-Yo before then there should be no hesitation regarding this album.  You won't be disappointed one bit.  4 Stars.**The Deluxe Edition comes with a DVD, which features all 3 videos released so far and a 15 minute interview/BTS with Ne-Yo.  It's nice to have, well done, and worth seeing at least once in my opinion but it's nothing essential. **\n", "val": 0.009323922917246819}
{"text": "December 11th, 2010Libra Scale (Deluxe Edition)ONE: CHAMPAGNE LIFE -> I like the extended version of this already great song which comes on the album. An exceptional celebratory song. Cheers to life! B+TWO: MAKIN' A MOVIE -> This track really flows well too. Production by Derrick White is absolutely top-notch. One of my absolute favorites. A-THREE: KNOW YOUR NAME -> Laid-back as hell. Dreamy production by The NeXmen and Paul Dawson and has Ne-Yo stretching and giving his vocals a workout towards the end of the track. A-FOUR: TELEKINESIS -> This song has Ne-Yo sexing a ladie's body and mind. Another great, great, laid-back track. B+FIVE: CRAZY LOVE (feat. Fabolous) -> This one is good but not great. It features the often missing-in-action early 2000's rapper, Fabolous. B-SIX: ONE IN A MILLION -> An absolute breezy mid-tempo. I love the African drums. Great lyrics and marvelous flow to it. ASEVEN: GENUINE ONLY -> This is a excellent (and underrated) track to switch things up just a little. It has a lot of bass and the hand claps just fit. A love song of sorts, but it's also somewhat upbeat. My new favorite track on the album. A+EIGHT: 'CAUSE I SAID SO -> My least favorite track of them all. Doesn't quite feel like Ne-Yo but still OK. Just not the greatest. B-NINE: BEAUTIFUL MONSTER -> A dance track and Ne-Yo's lead off single. A number one hit in the UK and on the US Dance chart. Otherwise, not a favorite but growing on me. B-TEN: WHAT HAVE I DONE? -> A track of self-reflection about doing someone wrong and turning them into a monster emotionally. I have a feeling some won't appreciate this great track. I especially love the bridge. A-This album is quite spectacular. One of the definite greats of 2010. Ne-Yo (as usual) took the time to co-write all of the tracks present and the songs fit his voice. The harmonies on many of the songs are bananas and most of the time, he seems really into what he is doing. You know, engaged in the material.I bought and have heard his first two albums in full and they just don't compare to this one. 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Year-of-the-Gentleman/dp/B0018QCXGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Year of the Gentleman</a>&nbsp;was probably a good release too seeing as I heard about half of those tracks and liked most of them but so far, this is the album of Ne-Yo's career.The main disappointment, even with the deluxe edition's extended versions of the music videos for \"Beautiful Monster\", \"Champagne Life\" and \"One In A Million\" is that there were no bonus tracks to help make this album feel a bit more fleshed out and us, a little less ripped off.Now don't get me wrong, the album feels complete and very cohesive but 10 tracks just isn't enough these days when I'm paying 12.99 for the download at iTunes. The videos were great but I would prefer extra tracks.All in all, a great purchase and the tracks are quite worth it. But some just won't be able to get over the fact that no matter what edition you get, you only will have 10 tracks. However, if you can get past that, this disc/collection of songs has VERY HIGH replay-ability and I am very, very proud to say that I purchased this album.\"A-\", 4.5 stars or a 9/10.DOWNLOAD:\"Genuine Only\"\"One In A Million\"\"Makin' A Movie\"\"Know Your Name\" &\"What Have I Done\"SKIP:None\n", "val": 0.018645361065864563}

{"text": "On his fourth release in his four year carrer, Ne-Yo decided to make a concept album. While concept albums, are nothing new, I can't recall an R&B artist whose actually gone all out the way Ne-Yo has with Libra Scale. The album is full of the slow jams and music designed to make you feel good. The deluxe edition comes with three long form videos for the singles Beautiful Monster, Champagne Life and  One In A Millon which all show Ne-Yo's creative side. After viewing the videos, it would have been nice to see the mini-movie that was oringally planned for the album. I can only think of one compliant with the album and that's the digipack, but other than that, Ne-Yo has produced another fine album and I can't wait for the tour.-- Track By Track--1. Champagne Life - The second single no explanation necessary. **** out of ****2. Makin' A Movie - Ne-Yo has always provided some sexy slow jams on his albums and this is no expectation. **** out of ****3. Know Your Name  - This is another  smooth slow that compliments the former track very well. I could easily see this video taking place after Champagne Life and before One In A Million. *** out of ****.4. Telekinesis - Another sexy slow jam t completes a trilogy of slow jams.  **** out of ****5. Crazy Love feat. Fabolous - As a preview reviewer said Fab, spits a nice verse in this song and considering this is the sixth track that the two have done together, I'm sure that they could make an album together that would be very nice. **** out of ****.6. One In A Million - The third single where Ne-Yo shows off his rapping skills. Much credit is given as Ne-Yo never goes into the territory of a singer trying to be a rapper. **** out of ****.7. Genuine Only - Every Ne-Yo album has a filler song and this is the song on this album. I would have loved to have the slow jam Chillin on the album instead of this one. ** out of ****.8. Cause I Said So - This is the only song other than Beautiful Monster, I don't really care of. I think it's a bit too much on the pop side. ** out of ****9. Beautiful Monster - I didn't really care for this song when I first heard it and I still don't. However the video is very creative. ** out of ****10. What Have I Done?  - The perfect way to close out the album and the storyline of Jerome & Pretti Sincliar. It's a somber ballad about heartbreak. **** out of ****\n", "val": 0.00368121569044888}

{"text": "The only reason NE-YO doesn't get a 5 is because this is his 4th album and he only gave us 10 songs.  I was hoping to get a good 14 tracks, he always makes good music, so that was the only thing that disappointed me.  Now on to the musical side of it.Champagne Life....mid tempo groove, and it's very apparent that MJ was a big influence in his life because all of his songs have that Jackson flair.  Let's toast it up!  It's a feel good song, normally when a song that's been played on the radio or you've seen the video leads off, normally that's not a good cd, not in this case.  I think he's getting you ready.  5 out of 5Making a Movie...another mid tempo groove...playful song about his superhero group trying to get the ladies.  Telling the women how cool they are, and they are going to make a movie.  Nice song, creative.  4 out of 5Know your Name....if this song doesn't remind you of a song that MJ would sing, nothing will.  Another gem, real smooth in the delivery and it's simply Ne Yo approaching a lady and politely asking for her name.  Again he's playing off the \"gentlemen\" role that he's set with the videos.  5 out of 5TeleKinesis......Could be the best song on the cd.  \"Girl have you ever, had someone had someone who takes the time, to sex your body, but also sex your mind.\"  The chorus alone is a beast, fellas, let's get inside of a womans mind, sex her mind and her body follows, brillant song!  5 out of 5Crazy Love.....Think of Lauren Hill's \"Sweetest Thing I've ever known\" song, and the music, the tempo, the guitars the whole feel puts you in that state of mind muscially.  I love Lauren's song, and Crazy Love is also a gem.  He's comparing love and insanity, he says they are related in the way that they make you act.  You know what, he has a point, love can make you insane, listen to the words and the music holds you. And Fabolous adds a nice little flow to the song, and it doesn't distract from the theme at all.  5 out of 5One in a Million....Love the video, love the dancing, love the whole \"the way you make me feel vibe\", first time I heard the song, I saw the video and I was immediately impressed.  Again he plays of the \"gentleman\" vibe and he's telling his newfound love that he's been everywhere and have seen a lot of different women, but she's the best.  Classic  5 out of 5Geniune Only.....Telling the tale to his lady that he hopes she's never alone. He's pretty much letting her know that they can weather any storm and that his love is geniune.  3 out of 5Cause I said so.....Up tempo groove, it's like the introduction of the women that Ne Yo's character is falling for.  In the song, with hints of MJ's \"Oh NO, sound from Dirty Diana\"  Kindy of techno feel vibe and maybe everyone won't feel it, but I think the groove is infectious and it's a perfect lead to the next song, Beautiful Monster  4 out of 5Beautiful Monster....A lot of artist are putting a sort of \"Will. I.Am\" song on their cd's, not all are good.  This one, is great, not too long but the music in the song is great.  The entire album is produced beautifully, the song is Ne Yo's character falling for the woman, he's trying to fight it but he can't.  She's the one that he can't beat. He's giving up his powers for this woman, and he doesn't mind.  5 out of 5What have I done...... A ballad finally.  He finishes the concept album with a ballad that sounds like something MJ would sing.  The synthesizing sound in the song sounds a lot like the beginning of \"human Nature\". The song seems to be questioning why he has chosen to take on the powers that were bestowed upon him and didn't follow the guidelines of what he wasn't supposed to do.  He was supposed to rid the city of crime, live the good life(champagne life) and lastly, not fall in love, which is what he did.  5 out of 5So you see, the concept album worked beautifully, not a bad song on the cd at all.  Each song fits, the production was flawless, he gives you the best that he can do and he doesn't miss.  He has elements of MJ and you can hear it in every song if you choose to do so, but I'm okay with that, Mike is gone, in my opinion, we need someone to keep some of the best things we liked about him alive, and I think Ne Yo does it very effortlessly.  Libra Scale is a gem, I hope I was able to give a little more insight into a classic album in the time of a bunch of junk in the R&B world.  Definitely must have in your collection.\n", "val": 0.006486448459327221}

{"text": "First of all, let me say that I have always thought that Kanye West was/is a complete and total jackass. From his \"George Bush hates black people\" comment to his brazen disrespect of Taylor Swift FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER, I have always turned away from the guy, both on radio and on TV. People who present themselves in such a manner are simply are not permitted in my reality. CLICK: you're gone. And when people present themselves as stupidly as Kanye West has managed to present himself these past few years, I CLICK really, REALLY fast.However....I now think that I might have been a little hasty in writing the guy off.Kanye West has a style of writing that is, almost by definition, schizophrenic (schizos unite concepts by means of non-essentials; I remember reading that one schizoid actually stood in front of a Judge and said that a beach was like a cigar because of some crazy definition of \"encirclement\" that made perfect sense to him, the schizo. The sentences formed by the guy, literally, made no sense whatsoever.) Kanye West adopts this as a sort of poetic style -- which in the hands of most folks would be an invitation to poetic disaster -- and yet he finds ways to make it work.It's really, really interesting what he's doing, here.Within a work of art, schizoid flavoring occasionally does create very powerful effects - particularly within the context of visual metaphor -- or via lyrics that employ the description thereof. There's a Pearl Jam video out there somewhere that has all sorts of random non-essentials thrown into the imagery (34 degrees, partly cloudy) and the effect is masterful. I don't have a name for this, but whatever it's called, Kanye West gets it, and gets it completely. He takes it just far enough, and no farther. He does it right. (Too, in what sounds like D-flat Major, the key itself gives the track a bit of a schizzy feel.)\"I slapped my girl, she called the fedsI did that time, and spent that breadI'm heading home, I'm almost thereI'm on my way, heading up the stairsTo my surprise, a n-gga replacing meI had to take 'em to that ghetto university...\"Kanye then inserts a FEMALE voice here, who sings:\"All of the lights...Cop lights, flash lights, spot lightsStrobe lights, street lights(all of the lights, all of the lights)All of the lights (all of the lights)(Lights, lights)All of the lights (all of the lights)\"Think about this for a moment, and consider how well this works. A conceptual focus on non-essentals is exactly what Ayn Rand would have called a non-objective epistemology - which it IS, no question about that - but observe the artistic power of this. Kanye creates some compelling imagery, here; violence presented via metaphor (ghetto university) - the verse creates the situation, while the Female voice then arrives with the chorus and presents LAW ENFORCEMENT via a conceptual non-essential dressed-up as metaphor.\"All of the lights...Cop lights, flash lights, spot lightsStrobe lights, street lights(all of the lights, all of the lights)All of the lights (all of the lights)(Lights, lights)All of the lights (all of the lights)\"Kanye West is showing some incredibly unique poetic skills, here. I don't know what this is called (it's not free verse (welllll... not really)), but whatever it is, it certainly is NOT iambic pentameter. It's nothing out of the textbook. You won't find what Kanye is doing here listed as a style in the Oxford Guide To Poetry. Kanye seems to have his own rulebook on what poetry is, and if you want my opinion, it's very cool.Kanye continues:\"Restraining orderCan't see my daughterHer mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that orderPublic visitationWe met at BordersTold her she take me backI'll be more supportiveI made mistakesI bump my headCourts suck me dryI spent that breadShe need a daddyBaby please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university....\"Observe that Kanye is ASKING the girl, he is not TELLING HER HOW IT IS. Look at his word choice; he's asking PERMISSION. He's PLEADING.The Female voiced then responds with a thinly-veiled threat:\"Turn up the lights in here babyExtra bright, I want y'all to see thisTurn up the lights in here, babyYou know what I needWant you to see everythingWant you to see all of the lights....\"In other words, the Female voice is saying, in metaphor, that she has law enforcement on her side - pay attention to the word choice: \"want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights.\"Look at this as a whole work - see the song WHOLE:Male voice presents: ViolenceFemale voice responds: All of the lights (law enforcement)Male voice presents: I need to see my daughterFemale voice responds: All of the lights (law enforcement)Observe how this is all done: via metaphor. Literally every reference to lights in the song is a reference to law enforcement.\"If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life,\" sings the Female voice - to a guy who has just said that \"I did that time\" and that the \"courts suck me dry.\" Heh... I don't know the back-story on this, but I can probably guess.Look, I'm not familiar with much of Kanye's West's music - and I'm gonna go ahead and get that handled here on my end. This is a master craftsman; this is what music is when it gets created by somebody who has something to say and knows exactly how to say it. Lyrically, Kanye breaks all of the rules here. The final result, however... is absolutely INSPIRED.It's a rap OPERA, and it's sublime.5 stars, no question.This is EXCEPTIONAL. This is some of the most original, unique, creative, and BRILLIANT work to find airplay in YEARS.(I almost expected to hear a young girl's voice at the end, asking Mommy and Daddy to turn off all the lights -- in other words, to get their nonsense HANDLED so that she can have a childhood. Songs that even lead you to think such things (to re-interpret something within them) are a rare breed these days, and I'll take all of it that I can get.)Absolutely brilliant.\n", "val": 0.0006873423117212951}
{"text": "\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" is by far the album of the year for me. And \"All of the Lights\" is the best track off the best album. Rihanna kills it on the hook and a short stint by Fergie is actually a nice break in the song. I believe Kid Cudi is also on the song along with Alicia Keys. The song has a bravado beat and has the operatic feel that most of the album has. Not some of Kanye's best lyrics, but there is already so much going on that it's not that noticeable. And those horns throughout are AMAZING. I guess I like this song, maybe TOO MUCH. I'll tone it down, I recommend this song.\n", "val": 0.02328461781144142}

That is the case after the lackluster Your Love, and here with Right Through Me, the second single from her debut album Pink Friday. I really wasn't very driven into the song, as we've seen with other Hip Hop influenced singers. It just wasn't really a very strong rap song. While she has worked with others from Mariah Carey and Lil' Wayne, she still needs to show a growth in her songs to know if she will stand out.

{"text": "Nobody talks to themselves quite like Nicki Minaj, man... and I LOVE the laid-back, COMPLETELY chilled vibe here, for the chorii. Nicki begins MOMENT with the voice of somebody who is absolutely ON FIRE, delivering a manifesto, and then she simply relaxes, as if, when discussing magic(al) moments in life, there is simply no need to even TRY to make the (obvious) point. It feels exactly right, too: when everything is clicking on all cylinders (in life), you simply don't feel any need to force the issue -- or even argue it: you KNOW it's all on-track; you KNOW you're on the correct road. Her arrangement of the song here feels truly right, absolutely sincere -- and that's why it's so powerful -- the laid-back chorus after the insistent, raging, rampaging intro is brilliant... the crit against this track by practically everybody out there in pundit-ville badly misses the point. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: Nicki is the single best Female rapper in the business -- the genre of rap was MADE for this girl to come along... and now, she's here, showing everybody how it's DONE.\"I fly with the stars in the skies,\" Nicki begins, and then: \"I am no longer trying to survive, I believe that life is a prize... but to live doesn't mean you're alive.\"Preach it, Nicki.\"Don't worry bout me, and who I fireI get what I desire, it's my empireAnd yes I call the shots, I am the umpireI sprinkle holy water, upon the vampire (vampire)In this very moment I'm king,In this very moment I slay, Goliath with a sling,This very moment I bringPut it on everything, that I will retire with the ring,And I will retire with the crown, Yes!No I'm not lucky I'm blessed, Yes!Clap for the heavyweight champ, Me!\"...you get the idea.MOMENT is a brazen, bold, triumphant song -- and that the hook here is delivered with a completely relaxed aire is PERFECT. It's NOT a flaw; it's INGENIOUS. It's a demonstration of sheer MUSICAL SENSE. Nicki knows exactly what she is doing -- and the critics are TOTALLY and COMPLETELY wrong in their slamming of this one: they just don't get it.I do get it, and I like Nicki just fine.4 stars.(Drake wrecked it for me, but still, Nicki shines as always.)\"This is my moment...I waited all my life...I can tell its time......drifting away...I'm one with the sunsets...I have become alive.\"Damn, Nicki.What took you so long...?This is what rap SHOULD be: intelligent, thought-provoking... it should feature something worth saying said by somebody worth saying it -- and saying it CORRECTLY -- and by that I mean with voice matching music, and with vocal tone matching content. (Rap, in fact, is a relatively new musical genre, and since it is so young we're haven't yet seen the real FULL development of it yet, as a style. Nicki is leading the charge, though. Mark my words, here: fifty years from now, when rap has gone through the period of development that American jazz went through after it's foundings, we'll be looking back on artists like Nicki Minaj as the people who took a musical style that was still in raw infancy, and showed what kind of potential was really buried deep within it.)Don't stop making music, Nicki.You're here on Earth to do THIS.Don't let ANYBODY tell you any different.\n", "val": 0.01255292072892189}

{"text": "Nicki Minaj lays the smack down again -- showing more character, personality, and solid identity within a single verse WITHOUT EVEN TRYING than most rappers show in an entire album. Nicky is something ELSE, man. She's so good at what she does that... hell, it ain't even FAIR, man. It just ain't even FAIR.Incredibly, this song was actually held back as a bonus track on Pink Friday -- and I don't know what actually happened here: 1. the song was either a throw-away that somehow found traction with Nicki's audience, or 2. more likely, an intentional decision was made to keep an obvious monster single hidden (available only as a bonus) to push the album organically after the first push at radio stalled (which they ALL do, eventually). MOMENT 4 LIFE was, indeed, the correct choice for lead-off single (the first 2 singles were \"preceeders,\" which means that they came out before the album, making MOMENT 4 LIFE the actual lead-off), but the idea of using a bonus track as a \"follow\" at radio is -- as far as I know, anyways -- untried (especially with so many radio-friendly units still left on Pink Friday remaining to break at radio!). My personal belief is that the label did this on purpose; notice that the video was already done. (!) That's a reveal, folks. That shows the cards. It's an interesting way to push a record, and it's especially risky for a new artist. They probably did it on purpose, too. That's BRILLIANT.Marketing effort aside now, the track itself has Nicki flexing, goofing, and gear-shifting comfortably in double-time, interspersing the brilliant verses with a much slower chorus -- both of which are massively commercial. I almost feel like the versus are more hooky than the chorii. (!) No question this is a stand-out track; you KNOW this is Nicky from the first moment you hear the voice -- and what's especially good about this record is that you KNOW you're listening to a unique voice, even if you haven't yet heard Nicki's stuff before. A girl I work with actually stopped speaking in mid-sentence when this song came on the radio, and, pointing at the dashboard, she asked me: \"Who IS this?\"That's all that needs to be said.It's massive, alright.5 stars for the title, and 6 stars for the brilliant idea of using a bonus track as a follow at radio.Heh.Whoever thunk-up that idea deserves a big fat bonus.An exceptional unit, with everything here being done by people who know EXACTLY what they are doing.Massive.\n", "val": 0.002161641139537096}

I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.But youtube exists now.

(or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.I guess I'm just babbling and I need to write a minimum amount of words to be able to post this review...

Don't let this song deter you from purchasing the new CD, because it is amazing and there are some great tracks that are very close to what you would expect from the previous one, including: \"Someday\" and \"Play It Loud\" which are kind of like \"I gotta feeling\". \"Don't Stop the Party\" would have been a much better choice for first single because it has a much nicer beat and is overall a higher quality track.

{"text": "I've never written a review before, but this song is so bad I felt I had to turn on my computer, get on the Internet and sign into Amazon just so I could write a review about this garbage and lower its star rating. Now that I'm here, I'm not sure what to say about this POS.This is literally the worst song I have ever heard. I first saw it on a hip hop website and thought it was a joke, and then when I actually heard it on the radio I felt like my intelligence was being insulted. Did The Black Eyed Peas actually think this s*** was good? Did the radio station think that if they played it enough people would like it? While most of us agree that the quality of popular music has been in decline for quite a while, I honestly did not think something this bad would become a hit. Most of the hits nowadays aren't the best, especially not compared to those of old, but I do find myself able to enjoy and sing along to about 70% of them in the car. I particularly like Ke$ha's songs, for example, even though I know they aren't the best and certainly wouldn't call them all-time favorites. At least they're entertaining, though, for the love of god. \"The Time\" (appropriately titled, as you'll be checking the time repeatedly to see how much closer you've come to the end) is painful to listen to.I had more fun getting my wisdom teeth removed and sitting in my house for days holding gauze up to my bloody, aching mouth and taking pills all day than I did hearing even one second of this song. The best part of this song is a sample from another song and even that is bad just because it is juxtaposed with the other crap. This song is not catchy, it has no real chorus, and it appears that they just randomized a bunch of sounds to create the 'music' and a bunch of words to create the 'lyrics.' The sample of \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dirty-Dancing-Soundtrack/dp/B000002W9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dirty Dancing Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;is completely different in theme from the s***tily-written verses, which are incomprehensible because whoever wrote them was drunk.Despite--or perhaps because of--the fact that the song is so bad, it has the nerve to be about ten minutes long. It never ends. I heard this song a month ago and it is still playing in the background as I write this. The painful memory of this song will haunt you for life, so if you haven't heard it already, avoid it. Stay away from the radio for a few weeks. There's no way this crap will stay popular for any longer than that. There is a limit to how stupid people can be.\n", "val": 3.26336121361237e-05}
{"text": "Picture the scene; a small, rustic village, peasants go about their daily lives in silence. Children are never seen here. A storm rolls through the sky, and a flash of lightning shows the hideous Castle Am high up in the mountains. The peasants shudder, some discreetly cross themselves. Inside Castle Am, the notorious madman Dr Will. I.Am is in his laboratory, busily splicing beats and ideas from other people's songs. He will later move from the laboratory to the lavatory where he will prepare his lyrics. His faithful assistant Fergigor shuffles behind him. Once beautiful, she is now more plastic than human. Her skin looks like its been ironed. Will. I.Am removes a 12\" record from its sleeve. \"I've Had the Time of My Life\" from Dirty Dancing. A crack of thunder fills the night sky, an omen for the atrocity that will soon be born. \"Look, Fergigor!\" Dr Am cackles, \"I shall take this song and sample it! But instead WE shall sing the chorus, and our vocals will be digitally altered until they sound perfectly ridiculous! And soon the whole WORLD will suffer at the hands of Dr Will. I.Am, as I seek to create the worst music of all time!\" Wild, manic laughter bounces around the dark castle walls, Fergigor tries to smile but her inhuman face will not allow it. 'twas the night that The Time (Dirty Bit) was created, an affront to both man and God.At least, that's how I like to imagine how this record was created, because the actual reality is altogether more depressing and certainly more frightening. I mean, he HAS to know, surely? Will. I.Am and the rest of those Peas just HAVE to know this is terrible. I just can't accept that they sit there, listening to this hilariously, aggressively awful music and think, \"yeah. That's some good work. We've done well.\" It's impossible. For the sake of humanity, it has to be impossible.So, yes, they lift the chorus from \"I've Had the Time of My Life\", and it makes you groan in embarrassment. But that's nowhere near as crass as the actual lyrics themselves. Now, BEP haven't been known to write thought provoking, meaningful lyrics before, but this makes \"I Gotta Feeling\" look like Subterranean Homesick Blues. \"If you didn't know that, well baby, now you know now\" doesn't even make sense, but when you're stealing \"Mick Jagger/Swagger\" rhymes from Ke$ha, it's surely time to rip the page out the notebook, scrunch it into a ball and start again.So we've got a cringe-inducing chorus, Auto-tuned vocals to the nth degree and banal, pointless, \"seriously, what are you even TALKING ABOUT?\" lyrics. Never before has music that sounds this expensive been so worthless. Making electro music is fine, and Will. I.Am would clearly like you to see him as some kind of futuristic pioneer of music, but guys like Deadmau5, the Toxic Avenger and Fake Blood have already perfected these stuttering, squelchy beats, with far more imagination and flair than anything you'll find on a BEP record.Real music fans will, of course, find this as pathetic and offensive as anything the BEP have done in recent years. It would be nice to think though, that even the great unwashed masses, the same people who dance and sing along to past abominations like Imma Be and Boom Boom Pow will instead stop, rub their eyes from the dream-state they've been in for years and just say \"NO.\" No to this feeble attempt at music, at the lack of skill or passion on display here. Just flat out NO. Then, and only then, shall Will. I.Am's mad reign of terror be truly over.\n", "val": 0.0001056409819284454}

{"text": "'Sunday Love' is FeFe Dobson's original sophomore record, but unfortunately, her label Island dropped her before they released it, meaning that it was shelved. It was very post-grunge, and she collaborated with music legends Joan Jett, Cyndi Lauper, and Courtney Love. Unfortunately, since it was shelved, Island had the rights to those songs, and they sold them to very tween-pop singers. But amazingly, they weren't bastardized! They still worked. None of this seemed to affect FeFe, and she continued to do her own thing. She went back to the sound of her self-titled debut, but incorporated a lot more indie, jazz, and blues elements to the new songs she was crafting. These songs became the second half of 'Joy,' and they deserve that position. They are truly the best part about this record, and they form a FANTASTIC euphoric climax. The first half of 'Joy' are the songs that she wrote after being resigned to Island (Which I personally feel was a mistake. The indie\\jazz\\blues elements were completely left out of these new tracks, and Island postponed the release of the record for 2 more years.), and they very much reflect the tween-popstars that covered some of her 'Sunday Love' songs. There is definitely a disconnect. 'Joy' is essentially two EPs from two different labels stitched together to form one LP. But it works. It show's FeFe's diversity, and the newer, more produced songs, are SUPER catchy.So while this may not be the record that I would have liked to have seen released (I really wish 'Sunday Love' was released, and that 'Joy' stayed true to it's indie roots), it's still a good record none-the-less, and I recommend it to any music-lover. Even music-snobs will find something to enJOY about 'Joy!'NOTE: 'Sunday Love' was completely finished, produced, and mastered. There is an official track listing, including a bonustrack. There were two different kinds of sample CDs released (for reviews), but neither included all of the songs. However, all of the 'Sunday Love' songs have been leaked onto the internet, and FeFe even stated in an interview that she hopes her fans can find a way of getting them. If you know how to do that, then I recommend following her advice. ;]NOTE 2: iTunes has a \"Deluxe Edition\" of 'Joy' which contains 4 additional bonustracks. If you don't feel the need to own the hardcopy, then I STRONGLY urge you to buy the 'Joy (Deluxe Edition)' off of iTunes. It is WELL worth it!\n", "val": 0.014832017943263054}
{"text": "Fefe dobson will be 26 in February of 2011, This album sounds too kiddie and Immature for her at this time in her life. I like some of the music from the disney kids of the 2000's, But I wasn't expecting this sound from Fefe, She's a grown woman now and I know shes had her share of life experiences by now. However, 95% of her NEW music and songwriting doesn't reflect that.I understand she's a writer and she's been writing fun and shiny plastic pop songs for pre-teens and kids under 18, Which is fine, But to write them for your own album is a bit much at this point, You're 26... If her record company doesn't understand that she's becoming of age and only wants her to release music for 13 yearold's then something is wrong and she should just move on. They obviously don't believe she's capable of anything more, It's extremely invalidating.Her unreleased album (Sunday Love) was more gritty and mature than this and it was completed 5 years ago, Which means she was 5 years younger than she is now. What's up with that? I've also noticed that her vocals are higher pitched and not as bare and rough as they were on the debut's unreleased followup (Sunday Love). Vocally and musically she's going for a more processed and kiddie princess poprock sound like her brand new friends Miley, Selena and Demi :)I'm not happy with the direction of this album at all. yet and still It's tolerable considering how long I've waited for something NEW from her and how much I adored her work prior to this album, but it will still take some getting used to.I cringe when I hear \"Watch Me Move\". I can't bare the high pitched childlike key she's whining in. It just sounds thrown together and she sounds like a kid that's had way too much a sugar, Like a sugar-high. It reminds me of Avril Lavigne's disappointing album (The Best Damn Thing) Who's also 26. Just crazy and all over the place.I 'do\" have to give her credit for songs like \"Set Me Free\", \"In Your Touch\" and even \"Joy\". All three are well written and show growth in her as a human being. \"You B****\" is also a HOT and fun song, Which would sound better and more intensed as a hard rock song with a humming bassline, amped up guitars and grunting vocals, Ya' know... Something more \"Age\" appropriate, But hey, you work with what you got. I would've preferred a heavier and harder sound for the entire album, But that's not what it is. \"Ghost\" (in my opinion) would sound better if the music had more rock appeal and the instruments were harder and more intense, And her voice sounded less \"Sweet\".Although (Sunday Love) is unreleased, I got my copy and I love that CD. It also WILL NOT be overlooked. It's a full length album, It just wasn't/Isn't easy to get a hold of. Anyone who's a fan of her work should get a hold of it, No matter what it calls for.After this NEW album (Joy) I won't be holding my breath for another album from her, And as I said In my (Sunday Love) review \"I doubt if she will ever be able to top this album\". I was correct!. From the producer's and writers to her own approach on that album, It all came together so well. It's just a shame it wasn't released. She was leaning toward a harder sound and now all of it has melted away.I rated the album 3 stars but it's a low 3, Less than three and just a tad more than two and half. I'm not thrilled about this album at all, I've heard every song from the Joy-recording sessions, the unreleased material, the b-sides and the bonus tracks and it doesn't get any better, it actually gets worse. The only song I like is the original version of \"Didn't See You Coming\" which had a stronger bassline and heavier sound, The vocals were also better.\n", "val": 9.631048305891454e-05}

I still think she is better off with out Island Records, because of the way they have treated her the last few years. The only good thing about Island Records is that they finally realized how good she is. I wasn't happy when she was dropped from Island Records right before Sunday Love was supposed to come out. Sunday Love is an amazing album, so I don't understand why they dropped her. I've been a fan of Fefe since day one. She deserves her place in the music industry, because she is talented, and different. I'm more than over joyed that this album is finally out! I'm going to support her extra by buying the I Tunes Deluxe Version, and buying a copy in the store. She deserves the extra support, after all she's been through the last few years.

This album is fun, upbeat and doesn't take itself too seriously.\"Stuttering\" is an immediate standout though I might add the chorus sounds slightly too much like \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" by Kelly Clarkson for my taste. \"Ghost\" which was the first official single is also a great track and shows the direction that Fefe went with musically. It's power pop/punk infused with an underlying dance vibe. It's sort of in the middle of a Good Charlotte and The Veronicas album.I love this album already and if you enjoy pop/punk and or happy exciting music, then this album is for you too.**note, my definition of punk is more along the lines of Third Eye Blind, American Hi-Fi etc... and not The Sex Pistols or The Clash. If that's what you're into-then this album is not for you.\n", "val": 0.019115939736366272}

And not that song order matters much these days, but \"Joy\" is such an inventive and fun song that it deserves top billing as the first track on the album.Finally, Fefe, we need more Dobson.

{"text": "Although the sting of the thought of \"Sunday Love\" never seeing this side of a jewel case still burns, having Fefe finally release her second CD to us fans is very much appreciated, at least in my opinion. I first saw Fefe on MTV in channel surfing when she did her music video, \"Bye Bye Boyfriend\" and I was pretty much blown away that here was this girl of color doing a bit of kick-butt rocking!!! I had never seen anything like her and I was more or less smitten. After buying her first CD, I watched for any news on her and any new music and then of course, down the line came early tracks from \"Sunday Love\", such as \"Don't Let It Go To Your Head\". Then came the crushing news that Island had dumped her and \"Sunday Love\" would never be released. Thank God for the internet and downloads, I feel that \"Sunday Love\" is one truly amazing album and Island sucks for not releasing it to the fans. Now that she has smoothed things over with Island and released \"Joy\", perhaps there is hope one day for \"Sunday Love\" with fresh material as well. I really enjoy the song, \"Stutterin\" and the music video is a whole lot of fun as well. I also really like \"Ghost\" and the music video to that one is great as well. \"Can't Breathe\" is really a stand out song I feel and I hope they turn that one into a music video as well! My only real hope is that one day Fefe ventures into California, Las Vegas or better yet my home in Arizona so I can see her perform in person! She's a great singer, great writer and a really beautiful young star! I wish her much continued success and ask that she just keep us rocking!!\n", "val": 0.004556004423648119}

{"text": "Nobody can deny Ron Isley's `legend' status by any means; the man - through The Isley Bros. has more hits than many new artists will ever have.  With a beautifully, sensual sounding tenor in his possession,  Isley possesses a golden voice - one of the best of our time.  On recent outings, `Mr. Biggs' has held it all together, continuing to `reinvent' himself just as he has throughout his long career with The Isley Bros.  Some will be quick to clarify this is Isley's second solo album (After 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Here-I-Am/dp/B0000C9ZK5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Here I Am</a>), but keep in mind recent efforts focus mostly on the soul legend exclusively.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mr-I/dp/B003YOMN8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mr I</a>, his fifth studio release of the new millennium (following 2001`s&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Eternal/dp/B00005N8UV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eternal</a>, 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Body-Kiss/dp/B0000931OT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Body Kiss</a>&nbsp;and Here I Am: Isley Meets Bacharach, and 2006's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Baby-Makin-Music-Feat-Ronald-Isley-AKA-Mr-Biggs/dp/B000BY8278/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Baby Makin' Music (Feat. Ronald Isley AKA Mr. Biggs)</a>, excluding 2007's holiday effort) falls short of an `upswing' for Isley.  While Mr. I should serve as the perfect `comeback' album after Isley's bout with cancer and imprisonment for tax evasion, it is merely an average addition to his discography.  Even the better cuts from Mr. I fail to capitalize on the momentum set by his previous three studio efforts with his brothers.  The missing link? R. Kelly, whose songwriting and production talents truly helped to make Isley sound incredibly fresh and relevant without sounding ill with modern, gimmicky R&B.The album opens with \"Take It How You Want It,\" which is enjoyable, but not valedictory.  The cut feels a bit restrained and undercooked compared to strong opening cuts from previous efforts: \"Move Your Body\" (Eternal), \"Superstar\" (Body Kiss) or \"You're My Star (Baby Makin' Music).  A little more pizzazz may have made \"Take It How You Want It\" more captivating.  Promo single \"No More\" is better, using guitar to give the cut a nice adult R&B feel. Despite being arguably the best cut from the album, it feels surprisingly restrained as well.  A solid chorus makes it worthwhile: \"So I'm never gonna let you go/they don't make `em like you no more... It's like an old school 64/they don't make `em like you no more.\"\"If I Lose My Woman\" feels undercooked as well, which is unfortunate.  \"Put Your Money On Me\" features an uninspired rap performance by T.I., which fails to aid in Mr. Biggs's lot.  The track is too modern for Isley, even if it sort of works.  Vocally, Isley feels to restrained, as if he cannot let his beautiful, sensual vocals encapsulate the track because of its nature.  \"Supposed To Do\" is by no means a `savior,' but it reigns the production team in to give Isley a track that better suits him with more of an adult-contemporary R&B vibe.  Despite this, a reference to `facebook' again questions if producers are `trying too hard' to make an already relevant artist (age or not) more relevant in the music industry of today.  If that's the case, call in R. Kelly to pen another hit for Mr. Biggs.\"Dance for Me\" is the first cut in a while that works perfectly with Isley, reviving the 80s sound that Isley cultivated with hit \"Between the Sheets.\"  \"What I Miss The Most\" is a strong slow jam, though it indulges the slightest bit too much becoming draggy by the finish.  \"I Need You\" is fine, with a quicker tempo and a catchily penned chorus.  Again, it is by no means `the second coming' but it is one of the albums better cuts.\"You've Got a Friend\" pairs the soul singer with fellow soul star Aretha Franklin for a duet that is solid, though not exceptional.  The chemistry is pretty close, particularly towards the end, but it never `gels' into the `perfect' performance.  Closing cut \"You Had Me At Hello\" is solid and smartly closes the effort with a slow jam - Isley's strong point.Overall, Mr. I is a flawed effort. It is always nice to hear a soul legend, regardless of the quality, but Isley has had much better efforts in recent times than this one.  This effort proves to be only lukewarm, which is disappointing after a four-year hiatus.  That said, Mr. Biggs's still has it, if anybody was questioning that.  He'd REALLY still have it with better material, however.\n", "val": 0.013284910470247269}

It might be a good time to retire this character for awhile because it's a little immature to hear an experienced man sing about being someone's sugar daddy (\"Supposed To Do\"), or getting his swag on with da homies (\"Put Your Money On Me\").  And the \"Ladies and Gentleman, Mr. I\" introductions on \"Take It How You Want It\" and \"Put Your Money On Me\" come off as a little too obnoxious, especially coming from loudmouth rappers.However, MR.

And when the Queen of Soul joins Mr. Biggs on a blazing version of Carole King's \"You've Got A Friend\", it's time to break out the fire extinguisher!\n", "val": 0.0022836532443761826}

{"text": "Basicially,after over half a century in the musi business this is Ron Isley's debut solo recording without his brothers or pairing him up with another performer. When I first heard this was coming out I instantly had in mind not only Isley's ability to transend generations and musical trends but also his OG style appeal that he's worn proudly in the last two decades almost as a badge of honor. This needless to say makes him very appealing to many new school hip-hoppers who've adopted his attitude and image so many Isley related albums during this period have been highly geared toward the contemporary hip-hop/R&B crowd. Now that would be fine if that genre itself hasn't been reduced to one of the most generic sounds R&B has ever produced,filled with digital clishes and very little creativity in the songwriting. Ron Isley,whether on original material or as a vocal interpreter needs either the right sort of production and/or instrumentation to really become himself. And sadly a good deal of this album just plain doesn't provide that.  Two of the more interesting songs are the acoustic guitar based single \"No More\" and a similarly themed cover of \"You've Got A Friend\" with Aretha Franklin looking,to a degree to recreate some of the magic created on the last famed male/female R&B pairing on this song:Roberta Flack And Donny Hathaway. And all the same these tunes are just alright and frankly,\"just alright\" is NOT good enough for either of these soul titans. A good cross section of this material,the main culprit being \"Put Your Money On Me\" with T.I are very very clished attempts at mining the contemporary digitized hip-hop/R&B style that pretty much defined the most recent Isley Brothers album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Baby-Makin-Music/dp/B000BY8278/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Baby Makin' Music</a>. Frankly,at least to my ears this sound has become beyond tiresome and it's rigid,overly repetitive nature doesn't really suit Ron Isley at all aside from his ability to adapt to the times. But if the music doesn't work frankly,why should he?  Another issue that is important about this album is how utterly lacking in uptempo funky and soul it is. The two most compelling of the R&B type tunes on this album are the midtempo \"Dance For Me\" and \"What I Miss Most\" and frankly neither of them are all that strong or powerful. It's not a terrible album but isn't that destinctive considering the source and none of the songs really stand out particularly well. And I don't entirely blame the hip-hop connection either because the Isley's 1996 album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mission-to-Please/dp/B000001E9B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mission to Please</a>&nbsp;was a collection of new jack inflected ballads with R Kelly and remains one of their best albums in terms of production and songwriting. Even the best of people in any genre have to have something of a dud in their career; this is not the first time such as thing has happened to Ron Isley and doubtlessly won't be the last. But I can only hope that,should he choose to continue his solo career that he sets the bar a bit higher in terms of quality standards next time around.\n", "val": 6.047066563041881e-05}

It's a shame that Amazon doesn't allow negative ratings or this would receive a solid -2 or 3.

Someone needs to tell these guys \"now\" does not rhyme with \"now\".Other lines borrow from the cheesiest lines in Ke$ha's \"Tik Tok\". The original Ke$ha lyrics were bad enough:\"And now the dudes are lining up, 'cause they hear we got Swagger\"but then we kick 'em to the curb unless the look like Mick Jagger\"I was always under the impression that Ke$ha was just desperate for a word that rhymes with \"swagger\", since I don't exactly think Mick is a looker, but apparently the Black Eyed Peas think he's the man, too:\"All these girls they like my swagger\"They callin' me Mick Jagger\"Huh? I didn't think it was possible to make a lyric even more non-sensical than Ke$ha's rhyme, but there you have it.Oh, and dramatically yelling lines like:\"Cause I'm...\"Havin'...\"A good...\"Time...\"With you.\"\"I'm tellin' you\"(chorus covered from 80's song)\"I had the time of my life\"Really? You couldn't have thought of anything more clever or subtle to say?Seriously the words in this song are mind melting.

It's worse than \"It's A Small World After All.\" Perhaps it's the familiarity of the \"Time Of My Life\" lyric that adds the hook, because the rest is comprised of a startlingly unoriginal dance track with generic lyrics about losing control on the dance floor and being freaky freaky, etc., which should, in theory, just blend in with the rest of the background noise.

I was kinda confused to why she would go this far out from what she's use to in her music. Most of the songs sound the same and the songs do not showcase her voice like her previous albums have. The only song that I really enjoyed was track #5. The rest I've played 2 and 3 times but they do nothing for me. I love you Chrisette but lets just take this one as a learning lesson and never release something like this again. Whoever convinced you to release this should be fired. I'm still a fan but I want the old Chrisette back, she sounds like everyone else in this CD...and thats not a compilment.\n", "val": 6.899923027958721e-05}

{"text": "I was less than impressed when I heard the snippets. And when I finally heard the album, I wasn't enthused at all.Her first album \"I Am\" will always remain a classic because I feel she used music that suited her voice. She's said herself that she patterned her voice after such jazz greats as Billie Holiday. Babyface recognized that factor, and expounded on it greatly with production.Chrisette decided to go a different route for Epiphany, which was a setback. With Ne-Yo heading the project in production, he took her into the R&B realm, and not in a great way. Now he's back again on the third album, and it didn't work again. Not to say that Ne-Yo isn't a fantastic producer (after all, his album released last week and it was awesome!), but just not for Chrisette.As far as \"Let Freedom Reign\" goes, so far I only like 2 songs on it: \"Goodbye Game\" and \"Unsaid\". Surprisingly enough, \"So In Love\" featuring Rick Ross is an okay track as well. I thought the title track featuring Talib Kweli and Black Thought would EASILY be the standout track, but it fails to deliver as well.I'll give it another listen and maybe see if something changes my mind, but with Jazmine Sullivan, Eric Benet, and El Debarge's products being played start to finish on my iPod, I don't see Chrisette coming up to their level.\n", "val": 0.000499511428643018}

{"text": "After Chrisette Michele's debut album her second album Epiphany left a lot to be desired.  It wasn't exactly a knockout punch and was more like a sophomore slump.  Others liked it but I felt it was lackluster and pedestrian.  I left that album completely disappointed especially since her debut, in my opinion, was a classic.  When I found out Chrisette would be releasing a new album I kinda felt indifferent about it.  On one hand she was featured on my favorite song of the year Rick Ross' Aston Martin Music in which she absolutely brought her A game and on the other hand I was still disappointed about Epiphany.  I found out she would be releasing a mixtape to whet the appetites and to serve as a prelude to the new album.  I downloaded the Love Thy Brother mixtape and largely thought it was wack.So I came into the album with rather low expectations and after listening to the album I'm still not happy about the output.  Let Freedom Reign is not cohesive and features songs that are clearly out of place.  There's a few songs where she channels her former self such as If Nobody Sang Along, I Don't Know Why But I Do, and I Sang Along but those moments of goodness are few and far between.  So In Love ft. Rick Ross is an above average song as well.  Both of the singles are weak; Goodbye Game & I'm A Star.  They lack personality and are pretty much standard fare and with a talent like Chrisette we need more than the standard.It pains me to say this but again Chrisette Michele has failed to deliver the goods.  For me, that's two albums in a row and that's unacceptable.  I cannot recommend this album especially on a release date that's crowded with better efforts from Jazmine Sullivan, Ron Isley, El DeBarge, Miguel, Eric Benet and Slim Thug.  In other words, you can pass on this one unless you are a die hard Chrisette Michele fan. 2.5 Stars.A\n", "val": 3.846602339763194e-05}
{"text": "Chrisette Michele brims over with confidence on \"Let Freedom Reign\", the follow-up to her no. 1 album \"Epiphany\" as she tells us she's a star tonight on the uplifting \"I'm A Star\", declares she's a beautiful queen and she'll be her number one on \"Number One\", and tells us how cool she is on the Trancey Dance number \"So Cool\" (penned by Ne-Yo). The dramatic title track \"Let Freedom Reign\" is spoken verse set to martial beats and featuring Talib Kweli and Black Thought, while \"I'm Your Life\" is upbeat with an insistent piano riff.The album is more upbeat than its two predecessors, but she slows things down on the piano ballad \"I Don't Know Why, But I Do\" (with her searing vocals questioning her feelings and motives), \"Goodbye Game\" (with a deceptively upbeat intro leading into a fiery ballad - simply spectacular), the piano-laced \"So In Love\" featuring Rick Ross, \"Unsaid\" (with clattering percussion), the spare ballad \"If Nobody Sang Along\", and the guitar-laced \"I Know Nothing\".Her best album yet!\n", "val": 0.054747916758060455}

{"text": "Really surprised by this album. In fact honestly,if I'd actually only listened to it half way and than shut it off I wouldn't see it as meriting a review at all. During the last couple of years I've seen the emergence of a series of albums by contemporary R&B female artists that I'd describe as \"high concept\" releases. Some are extremely successful both in creative and commercial terms. Janelle Monae's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-ArchAndroid/dp/B002ZFQD0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The ArchAndroid</a>&nbsp;is a perfect example. And that appears to be what Chrisette Michele was going for on her third release. Her first two albums. In her liner notes the concept is abundantly clear. She's decided to address the troubles of the modern day recording industry such as the obsession with surface value and resulting creative crisis's. On that end it's apparent that she has found herself in the middle of one. She isn't sure if the jazzy R&B/funk direction is for her after all. And seems to be changing her mind about her adventure. It all comes into her commentary. You'd think with an album with such a worthy and lofty mission that it would be a masterpiece. It didn't turn out quite that way.  For one thing there's one simple contradiction. Much in the same way Funkadelic one proclaimed they were \"rescuing dance music from the blahs\",this album definitely has a similar concept. The problem comes because a lot of the music embraces many of the ideas it's supposed to protect people from. Songs such as \"I'm A Star\",\"I Don't Know Why,But I Do\" and \"The Goodbye Game\" all embrace just about every contemporary hip-hop/R&B cliche one can imagine. The bassy techno strains of \"So Cool\" is even more puzzling at first. It isn't until you listen to some of the other songs do you find out why they are there. There is a title song and it is one of the strongest songs on here. Featuring Talib Kweli it's a powerful modern funk message song speaking about the hypocrisy of modern society,especially in dealing with matters of race and national defense. In an era when topical songs are extremely rare,this really speaks volumes. Another important song is the epic \"If Nobody Sang Along\". And THAT'S when the commerciality of some of the other songs is explained. As in the liner notes she's filled with a lot of doubt,contemplating selling out for further popularity or sticking to her guns.  As anyone who reads my reviews a lot know I am not a \"cranky reviewer\". In fact anything below a four star review is very rare for me these days. The only reason I do so here is because Chrisette Michele is someone whose creative integrity I respect and trust. I completely understand and relate to her conception on this album. And I also support the fact she HAS a concept that's socially relevant. A friend of mine from Oakland had a conversation with me a few years ago about how critical people have become with music and film these days. His contention was that today's trouble was there WASN'T ENOUGH analytical criticism of these art forms in these day and age. That they were all seen as conventional media,little more than commercials and not looked into with more of a fine toothed comb. This album really helps me understand that. The modern cliche's she embraced,even in irony didn't add up to a creatively potent album. The fact she subdued her excellent vocal ability on these tunes didn't help either. If she'd extended the albums two best songs into a full cinematic album concept ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/What-s-Going-On/dp/B00007FOMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">What's Going On</a>&nbsp;or Curtis Mayfield's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Back-to-the-World/dp/B000B9WDIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back to the World</a>&nbsp;it would've been an easy successor to her previous two triumphs. Unfortunately,as it stands this is her most creatively erratic album thus far. Chrisette Michele is still,however a talented lady. Better luck from this point on! She deserves it!\n", "val": 0.009293402545154095}

But I took the chance on Chrisette Michele and I'm very glad I did.I loved this CD start to finish.  I like an artist who tells a story with her voice, and she is definitely one!  This album has just the right mix of music that you can literally listen straight through and enjoy it all.  I can't remember the last time I said that about an album by anyone else.  I especially encourage anyone else who's just recently learned of Chrisette Michele to take a chance and buy this CD.

So much so that I delayed writing anything here before having a little more time with the album.Music being the emotional force that it is. Every one is entitled to their opinion. I, however am having a hard time finding any flaws in this album. Her singing is just breathtakingly beautiful, and powerful. I felt each song had it's own voice and purpose.The only song that didn't hit me at first note was \"So In Love\" because Rick Ross makes my skin crawl every time he opens his mouth. Same song with a decent rapper would have been better, but the vocal arrangement more than makes up for this slight misstep.

I didn't even realize how great the CD was until I listened to it in the car from beginning to end. It's just well written music that takes you through all sorts of emotions seemingly from the artist herself. Many of the lyrics are really clever if you listen to them. The ballads are by far the best part of the album and they make up most of it.I FULLY disagree to those that say she ran away from the Billie Holiday influence. You must not have listened to it. Check out \"If Nobody Sang Along\" it's a sad song, but it's great in it's honestly and if it doesn't remind you of Billie Holiday (without it coming from her directly) I don't know what else would sway you.This is a good album.If there's any problem it's that she's seriously underrated and lacks access to artists/sounds that would compliment her sound. I really wouldn't mind more UK influence in her sound. I don't want to ramble so I'll just say this... it's a good album for music lovers.\n", "val": 0.02226184867322445}

{"text": "Chrisette Michele\"Let Freedom Reign\" (2010)This is yet another modern  R&B  project badly produced. The vocally gifted Chrisette Michele fairs best on ballads. The strongest of which is \"I Don't Know Why, But I Do\".  The other ballads are lyrically mediocre and under-developed. The title track has unique rap, spoken word elements coupled with an oddball vocal arrangement.  Less guest appearances would have been the way to go on this misfire.  Guests tend to take the focus away from the featured artist.Audio-tune and other vocal tweaking devices are wasted on Michele's self sufficient vibrato. Let  the vocally challenged Brandy, Britney Spears and Rihanna use the tricks. They need the tricks. Michele doesn't.

She has undergone more evolutions with three albums, than most artists go through their entire career.With Let Freedom Reign, Chrisette takes us on a journey through our freedom to live, be happy, and most all love and be loved. The album is coherent, and at the end of the day all the songs make up an actual album.The epic title track, \"Let Freedom Reign\", sees Michele rapping as well as singing the chorus, and having two guests on the track. \"I Don't Know Why But I Do\" containes signature Chrisette Michele vocals, and is the most beautiful ballad on the album. There are some slower tracks on the album, but the album is put together well enough that you can listen to the whole thing in your car or as background music and not have to skip one track. The interludes and skits, although unnecessary, don't retract from the album, and many might find it enhances it.Chrisette shines the most in \"Goodbye Game\", a slow jam about finally leaving behind an exhausting relationship, and \"So In Love\", a song with hip-hop elements that brings out Chrisette's edgier side, alongside Rick Ross.Overall, the album is excellent, and Chrisette's most cohesive body of work to date.\n", "val": 0.06135953590273857}

Her second CD, \"Epiphany\" was also a winner for me, even though I felt it was more garden variety R&B for the masses.  It didn't have that same \"spark\" and \"freshness\" of her first CD, but I liked it nonetheless.While I can listen to \"Let Freedom Reign\", it doesn't quite do it for me like her previous CD's.  It has a commercial/poppy vibe and I feel that the CD was over-produced.  They really should have applied the Coco Chanel Rule- after you get dressed remove the last accessory you put on.  There are too many synthetic beats and other distractions, such that many of the songs sound the same, and not enough pure vocals.  And Chrisette can SANG!  I want to hear more of her amazing voice without all the background noise.  \"If Nobody Sang Along\" is my fave track for the very reason that it is stripped down and her voice is showcased.  However I'm sure that this CD will grow on me eventually.I still love Chrisette and I'm hopeful that she will return to the original jazzy, funky-fresh style that caught my attention with \"I Am.\"\n", "val": 0.009372241795063019}

The songs were sincere, honest, emotional and real BUT we could dance, cry, and sing along with her. This album is a big no thanks for me besides Goodbye Game and So In Love.Her first album with the exception of \"Love Is You\" was a bit flat for me as well. Sorry Chrisette but I can't roll with you on this one. Try again. Get a new production team or something because this isn't it.

I think sometimes you've to change it up a bit, or it can get boring after awhile. She is a really great singer, she can write her own songs too, which is great for an artist, because many artists don't. I think her album sales should be higher than they are, because she is a talented artist. Maybe she can make it past gold status on this album. Putting Rick Ross on this album on the song So In Love was a good thing to do. I hope she collaborates with more artists on her next album. This album is one of my favorites of 2010.

She needs to live again, love again, \"Let Freedom Reign.\" Staying in that state of mind will mess with ones mind, and NOTHING is worth all that.  Getting back in the ball game of the living and being happy, is what I get from Chrisette's new album. She may not be totally over whatever it is she was going through(and I hear that to), but I applaud her for atleast trying to move on to bigger and better heights, and not stay stuck in the past. Although I love those sad, crying songs (nothing but the blues), there's only so much of the blues any person can take.  Seems to ME Chrisette have progressed tremendously, and there's so many women young and old, going through some of the same stuff Chrisette, and many other artist are going through with, love, relationships, and other mayhem(LIFE). Sorta like (1st) Elementary, (2nd)High School (7-12), (3rd)College, waiting to really experience life.  Chrisette reminds me so much of my daughter(who introduced her music to me), and they both need to get their HAPPY back and have some PEACE or is it PEACE and be HAPPY. In order to appriciate \"Let Freedom Reign\" a person is really going to have to LISTEN, and understand exactly what she is saying. She have great messages in her songs, that help many women, and I love that. It doesn't matter what Chrisette Michele sing I always hear that jazz influence, and her voice echoes so lovely. What I really like about many of her hooks, is she give solutions, and tell young girls how to be, Number One, to So cool, and Goodbye Game, the three songs my daughter love.

{"text": "Flo Rida makes up-tempo music that is great for basketball activity. I like it for Women Basketball players & I believe they will love this album in particular. This is perfect for workouts, conditioning, practice, pregame warm-ups, & after the game. Your athletes will not be disappointed! It is a short record, but it is well worth it. It is at a great price. Here's my advice for male coaches of women's basketball teams. If you need something to help get your women athletes motivated & ready, buy Flo Rida's \"Only One Flo\" right now! It is a good record for women basketball players at any level of play. It does not matter if it is high school, college, or even the WNBA, this record is the one for you! 10 Stars for great music & great basketball!\n", "val": 0.05241216719150543}

{"text": "This is a great CD release by the talented hip hop/rap musician Flo Rida titled \"Only One Flo Part 1\". This great CD, unfortunately has only 8 tracks, which is very unusual in the CD era (usually 10 tracks or more in most releases is the standard/norm)! The CD opens with \"On And On\" : a great track with great melody, great chorus & good rapping by Flo Rida. Other great tracks include \"Who Dat Girl\" (great vocals featuring Akon), \"21\" (great melody & 'racy rapping'. This track features Laza Morgan) & \"Respirator\" (great techno sound with good rapping), Okay tracks include \"Turn Around (5,4,3,2,1)\" [a dance rap track] & \"Why You Up In Here\" (featuring Ludacris, Git Fresh & Gucci Mane). Solid tracks/gems include \"Come With Me\" (beautiful music, great drums, harmony & chorus. This is my favourite track from this great CD & hence the title of my review) & \"Club Can't Handle Me\" (a fantastic dance track featuring the great French dance maestro David Guetta). On overall, this is a great CD release, rather short on tracks but nevertheless gives a great listening pleasure. It's rather refreshing to have great rapping without explicit lyrics, a highly recommended listening.\n", "val": 0.03213385120034218}

{"text": "This EP album is the first of two parts, with the first intended to showcase Flo Rida's melodic side. So naturally, the focus on this set of songs is on pop melodies. Each song is executed with precision, professionalism, and outstanding production. But as far as the hooks go, they were a bit stronger on his previous effort. The opening track, \"On And On,\" which features Kevin Rudolf, is typical of most Rudolph material - it sounds great on the stereo but just can't develop a melodic hook that catches on. Other tracks follow a similar pattern, such as \"Respirator\" and \"Come With Me.\"There are a few great tracks, in particular the single \"Club Can't Handle Me,\" which is to say the least a page out of the Black Eyed Peas' book. Other winners include the Akon collaboration \"Who Dat Girl\" and \"Turn Around (5,4,3,2,1).\"For an 8-song EP, this is not bad at all, but if this is the EP that is supposed to focus on melodies, there are only a couple of tracks that rank among his best work. 3.5 stars.\n", "val": 0.005660638213157654}

{"text": "I've been with Benet since True To Myself. He still has the voice that he had all those years ago, but something has changed. Many music fans want their favorite artists to put out projects that mirror one another. I myself am no such fan, and have liked the way Benet has weaved in an out of different styles throughout his career. Lost in time is no exception. Honestly Benet really shines on the duet's on this CD. Over the years he has made music magic with Faith Evans, Tamia, and Terry Dexter. He teams up with Chrisette Michelle (in one of her more enjoyable songs), Eddie Levert, and Ledisi to amazing results. Don't get me wrong his is great on the rest of the album as well, and musical evolution is truly something to hear.\n", "val": 0.04178841784596443}
{"text": "The initial promotion for Eric Benet's \"Lost in Time\" suggested vintage production value in the tradition of seventies' legends with songs to match. Other than the great CD cover where he looks like today's Johnny Mathis, the impossibly handsome Benet comes closest to capturing his nostalgic targets on the Gamble and Huff inspired duet with Eddie Levert, \"Pain\". Sharing the mic with the venerable lead singer of the O'Jays, helps of course, but \"Pain\" is also a solid song in the tradition of \"For The Love of Money\" and solid songs are just what this project required to live up to its promise.Songs and motifs that only generically skim the surface of their inspiration are the primary reasons that Benet's earnest efforts add up to A VERY LISTENABLE AND PLEASANT CD instead of a really good one. He aims for Thom Bell three times (\"Never Wanna Give You Up\" beckons for its missing oboe, \"Always A Reason\" is written prerequistely in three as Benet recalls Russell Thompkins but lacks Bell's magical chord changes to lift it from the mundane and the title track, \"Lost in Time\" comes off like the annoying Siamese Twin of \"You're The Only One\" from his last project.)Faith Evans signs up for Feel Good, a tepid nod to the Emotions and Maurice White. Bringing the horns up in the mix would have added some energy to this track. Unlike Benet, David Cole and Mariah Carey understood that it takes more than just borrowing the bass line from \"The Best of My Love\"/\"Got To Be Real\" to make a memorable acknowledgment to the House of Maurice.Eric revisits Curtis Mayfield on his duet with Chrisette Michelle ( Take It) but the vaguely \"Pusherman\" like motif cannot save it from the forgettable. This track cries out for the assistance of Raphael Saadiq.Ledisi's magic gets covered in the mix of the inconsequential Good Life. She is turned way down near the end. Eric hits orgasmic vocal heights on the written-by-numbers, \"Sometimes I Cry\" and manages a decent hook in his \"Stevie-Lite\" moment (Summer Love).Eric Benet is a wonderful singer and his vocals are the best thing about \"Lost in Time\". Despite its broken promises, this project is well worth the listen. Maybe one day, he will deliver a suite to match his vocal prowess.\n", "val": 0.00401060888543725}

Stir It Up  - This is another modernized song and just makes you feel good while listening to it. *** out of ****8. Summer Love (feat.

{"text": "Singer, Songwriter and Musician Eric Benet found himself at a personal and professional crossroads. In spite of a decade that had began with great promise, thanks to his gold-selling and Grammy-nominated Tamia duet, \"Spend My Life With You,\" his reputation as low-key R&B love man was nearly destroyed thanks to acknowledged infidelity against his then-wife, actress Halle Berry. His third CD, the intensely-emotional Hurricane, finally ended his six year recording hiatus and produced a couple of hits, but he didn't completely restore the groove until 2008's Grammy-nominated follow-up, Love & Life. Now, over a decade into his solo career and nearly a decade removed from Hallegate, Mr. Benet's fifth effort, Lost In Time, feels just as well-crafted as its predecessor, giving his faithful following exactly what they expect---lush, love-struck ballads and mid tempos featuring twists of sophistication and sensuality.When Mr. Benet entered the studio for Love..., he confessed (during an interview to SoulTracks, no less) that he'd sequestered himself in the studio with longtime collaborators George Nash and Demonte, employing old school methods to crank out melodies for the songs rather than the other way around. The process of anchoring lyrics to a strong musical foundation continues to serve him well, evidenced in vintage-sounding tracks like \"Always a Reason,\" which could've been an outtake from a Stylistics album in the way it interpolates \"Break Up to Make Up\" and employs a tender falsetto to coax his way into a reluctant heart: \"There's a lifetime of tears we could both leave behind, cuz' in so many ways, we've been broken inside/All the questions you ask, we'll find answers together in time , all you need is to believe...\"\"Never Want to Live Without You\" is another blue-light-basement-party special, filled with confessions of a man who's wronged his lady and vows to move faithfully into a brighter future.  The exquisite title track describes the heady sensation that new love creates, and vulnerability reaches new heights with the aching slow-burn of a ballad, \"Sometimes I Cry,\" brimming with tear-stained, Prince-worthy pleading for another chance (or at least a fresh box of Kleenex): \"There's a smile on my face, yeah, but I'm broken inside/Sometimes I cry, when I'm all alone with this heart of mine. \"Even the most successful performers need to shake things up from time to time, and that's what Mr. Benet accomplishes, surprisingly, on the Gamble-and-Huff-recalling \"Paid.\" What could've been an ill-fitting and self-conscious duet is, instead, a freely funky jam that laments having more month than money and how the lean green is getting harder and harder to come by. Eddie Levert's baritone complements Mr. Benet's tenor as they grumble about getting \"paid on the first, paid on the last, and struggle all through the middle/M-O-N-E-Y never seems to multiply for me,\" a rich experience for the singers and the audience alike.Still, in spite of its overall excellence, a few songs in the line-up manage to fall short. \"Take It,\" which pairs him with Chrisette Michele, sounds like a tentative I-don't-want-to-outshine-him/her vocal run instead of the fun frolic it was meant to be, and \"Good Life,\" featuring Ledisi, has a great message but needs a more modern backdrop to really drive it home. \"Something's Wrong\" wants to wrap up the collection with a conscience, but it seems to contradict itself in stating that, yes, the whip is fly and the cash is flowing, yet the evidence of mankind's suffering isn't exactly making his day, thank you very much: \"I avert my eyes as I travel them roads, of people begging on the street/Don't mess up my vibe and show another sick child ain't had enough to eat.\" Huh?More nuanced than Hurricane, but less exuberant than Love & Life, Lost in Time---even with its missteps---powerfully demonstrates Mr. Benet's artistic assurance and finesse, qualities that will keep the Milwaukee, WI native from becoming, well, just that.\n", "val": 0.01402382180094719}

{"text": "'Lost In Time' matches one of the industry's greatest voices with some outstanding music and lyrics of 80s nostalgia that should *never* go out of style. Classic, soulful, and reflective, the CD conjures up summer memories of my childhood in the 80s. The influences of touchstone songs such as Cheryl Lynn's \"Got To Be Real\", The Stylistics' \"You Are Everything\", The O'Jays' \"Backstabbers\" and The Gap Band's \"Yearning For Your Love\" are heard throughout the CD.My favorite songs are: \"Paid\" ft Eddie Levert, \"Always A Reason\", \"Stir It Up\", \"Good Life\", & \"Never Want To Live Without You\". I also enjoy his rendering of \"Better & Better\" originally done by Ms. Lalah Hathaway even if he brings nothing new to it.I gravitate to artists like R. Kelly, Cee-Lo, and Marsha Ambrosius who are making some great retro music. Eric Benet is no exception. On 'Lost In Time', Eric Benet finds his niche in the classic soul stylings of the past. This is an outstanding CD from beginning to end, and I am incredibly proud of him!\n", "val": 0.034236397594213486}
{"text": "During the December of 2010 a lot of excellent R&B and soul albums were being released at roughly the same time by Ron Isley,El Debarge,Charlie Wilson the the newer Chrisette Michelle. I myself had always enjoyed Eric Benet since the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/True-to-Myself/dp/B000002KQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">True to Myself</a>&nbsp;days when he was merely and up and coming neo souler in the vein of DeAngelo and Maxwell. As with those two at the time he had something to proove musically but in many ways since than the modern music scene and Benet's own personel journey have led him to the place I'd always been hoping he'd go. Even today neosoul is defined as a rather retro sounding music that,in some way must owe some sort of musical debt to whatever digital hip-hop style or rapper is popular at the moment. Intricately crafted songs are not priorities but rather simple,sing-along hooks with the overkilled \"Whoh ho,whoh ho,whoh ho!\" chant are the order of the day. Either that or you have overly naturalness obsessed performers who through their insistance on live instrumentation in ones face to such a degree it's slightly off putting. Now in the case of Benet's tribute to 70's R&B styles here he manages to strike the right balance,as only a select few modern albums have between live instrumentation,in the pocket production and extremely well crafted songs.  Much of the music here is highly inspired by Thom Belle and soul balladeers of the early 70's such as The Delfonics. \"Never Want To Be Without You\",\"Sometimes I Cry\",\"Always A Reason\" and the title song will all attest to that as they feature the same kind of scaling melody,strong accentuating horns and even that defining electric sitar type of sound. It's at the time that the albums tempo goes up that it really gets great. Now in terms of retro soul it's all too easy to fall into the obvious clishe of doing just ballads and midtempo  numbers even if well done. But when you have songs like \"Feel Good\" and \"Good Life\",recorded with Faith Evans and Ledisi respectively you know your in a good place:these songs take the funk/disco/soul hybrid of the early 80's now called \"boogie\",with it's string and horn charts and churning rhythm sections and hooks mixed with modern mixing and production techniques for a very potent and funky experience. The O'Jays Eddie Levert comes in on \"Paid\",a churning,wah wah guitar powered update of the classic Gamble/Huff Philly funk sound (very close to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Back-Stabbers/dp/B00160ANKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back Stabbers</a>&nbsp;in fact) whose message reflects how the socio econmic status of the 70's paralells to todays similar issues and how vital yearning and less confrontational and profane message songs are to contemporary R&B music.  The album is rounded off with the jazzier Billy Paul styled tribute \"Something's Wrong\" and,as with much of the other romantically themed music on this album we see someone who has learned from the mistake of having been a philanderer in their youth and has an important message for their audience not to make the same mistake and why. It's by no means beggy and preacher-most of the time the powerful music and Benet's trademark carmely vocal delivery tell most of the story. And while I must admit live instrumentation is always vital to R&B and always will be it's even more wonderful to see them in the hands of someone who produces them in the best way possible and,equally so does so without restorting to any modern clishes:most important of which is that need to owe some debt to the currently overdone hip-hop/R&B genre. Yes this album will naturally have an appeal to anyone whose musical tastes were guided by the 70's and early 80's R&B generation but is also quite encouraging to younger up and comers who see that the kind of music with the kind of production they've loved FROM these people hasn't disappeared and can be expanded on for todays audience. And for that alone,even if unintended I thank Eric Benet for releasing this album as it is.\n", "val": 0.005733957514166832}

{"text": "Eric Benet is a real musician. He has the ability to play instruments, he has wide vocal range, and so much of his music is simply timeless. \"Hurricane\" is and will likely always be my favorite of his LPs, but none of them are lackluster. A lot of people love Maxwell so much, but I love Eric Benet just as much as I love Maxwell. Maxwell is no better musically than Eric is.The reason this LP is titled \"Lost in Time\" is Eric Benet is paying homage to music of the 1970s. I enjoyed every track. This album's weakest moment is the duet with Eddie Levert called \"Paid.\" I could not get into it though I like both artists. Most of the songs on this album are about relationships. Luckily, most of them speak on the positive side of relationships and I appreciate that. I get sick of hearing about heartbreak and sadness. Love certainly has a happy side. He joins forces with Faith Evans again (they also sang \"Georgy Porgy\" together) on \"Feel Good.\" Eric is telling his woman how good she makes him feels on this track. The album's lead single, \"Sometimes I Cry\" is a splendid record. It is an emotional number as Eric is clearly singing from his heart. I love Eric Benet, but after hearing that track, it motivated me to listen to this entire album at once and I am glad I did.If you have read my review, you will know that I am about to encourage you to invest in this LP. There is live instrumentation, and what music lover can't appreciate that? Additionally, he has never sounded better. What are you waiting for?

{"text": "In his fifteen year career as a solo performer, Eric Benet has stayed in his lane for most of his career. He has done the retro soul thing with few contemporary updates within that window in time. He has amassed a somewhat impressive body of work, even if his personal life has gotten him more noteriety than his music (See: His marriage to Halle Berry, for example). He has done six studio albums- five released and one shelved- including his recently released \"Lost In Time\". On this new album, he forgoes his longtime producer Demonte Posey in favor of George Nash, Jr.- who, along with Posey, produced Eric's 1996 debut \"True To Myself\". This time around, Eric goes into the territory of live instrumentation as well as live recording- to give it an 'old school' feel. Joining him on this recording are Ledisi, Chrisette Michele, Eddie Levert of The O'Jays and Faith Evans, who makes her second appearance on an Eric Benet album, having previously appeared on his 1999 sophomore album \"A Day In The Life\".There are some good songs on this album, but upon listening closely, one can instantly notice how a great deal of the songs sound noticeably similar to classic soul songs of yesteryear. The song \"Feel Good\" sounds a lot like Cheryl Lynn's \"Got To Be Real\". The ballad \"Always A Reason\" is basically The Stylistics' \"Break Up To Make Up\" with more chord progressions. The recession themed \"Paid\" is The O'Jays' \"Backstabbers\" played in a different key. On the title track \"Lost In Time\", he channels Blue Magic's \"Sideshow\". The musical arrangement to \"Good Life\" sounds eeriely similar to Sister Sledge's \"We Are Family\". While Eric means well in his effort to bring back traditional soul, he ends up looking like a copycat in the process. With that said, this album could have been a lot better if he used retro soul music as an inspiration and not straight out plagiarism.\n", "val": 0.0011045970022678375}

{"text": "Eric Benet has always been one of my favorite singers regardless of his love life in reality :). His voice is one of the truest of the modern R&B/Soul music era. To me, \"Lost in Time\" combines all the good things from his previous works and takes the listener on a lovely time journey that pays homage to the past musically stylings which have so clearly influenced Benet.One of my favorites on the album is \"Stir It Up\", which is a slower tempo version of the cut \"Weekend Girl\" from his previous album \"Love & Life.\" The cuts \"Never Want To Live Without You,\" \"Lost in Time\" and \"Always a Reason\" have a Chi-Lites-type ring to them, chocked with the melodic tones for which they are famous. Being a musician as well as a singer, Eric has reincarnated that classic sound without being a Puffy-style rip off artist. The production on this album is immaculate! Throughout the album, one can feel his deep appreciation for classic soul music by his use of grooves, horns, riffs and beats.If I had a knock on this album, it would be the collaborations. \"Feel Good\" with Faith Evans falls just short. It's nowhere near the songs produced from the great duos like Marvin Gaye/Tammy Terrell or Donny Hathaway/Roberta Flack, or even their hit \"Georgy Porgy\" on the Eric's sophomore album \"A Day in the Life.\" I liked - not loved - \"Paid,\" a collaboration with O'Jays' legend Eddie Levert.

Now I must go back and discover his older albums because I clearly have been sleeping.  I highly recommend this one as it's one of the best soul albums of the year and easily worthy of purchase.  5 Stars.\n", "val": 0.027608225122094154}

He used artists such as Faith Evans, Chrisette Michele, Ledisi and the living legend Eddie Levert to accentuate an already Grammy worthy package. It's also a treat to hear his daughter India on the Summer Love track. The flow of tracks are seamless. I can't say I have a favorite because the whole CD is awesome. Thank you Eric for taking it back with some old school flows that remind me of groups like the Spinners and Stylistics. I recommend you go out and purchase this album. As a matter of fact buy two and give one as a present to someone. You will definitely win cool points if you do.\n", "val": 0.06249108910560608}

Throw in actual instrument created sounds & you are spellbound by something we call real music. This set goes from being in love to surviving the struggle; a good spectrum of life. Eric does give us a little extra this round with his strong falsetto. Listening to this on the bus last night, \"Sometimes I Cry\" brought me to tears. He brings it all with each track, you can't help but feel every emotion as you are reminded of your own past that relates.Lost In Time is an instant classic to me.

We live in a society of evolution and when you think that we are going back to our roots of music and not allowing ourselves to be caught up in this era of Neo Soul, Hip Hop or even Rap.  We should thank our lucky stars that we still can and always will turn back to real music and real sing.  Eric Benet has always been not only a great singer, but an outstanding live performer.  His latest project Lost I Time is just that...A timely collection of songs that will not only captivate you, but it keep having you wanting more.  Great arrangements, great lead and background fills.  I understand that as time change, we all have to change with the times.  Listen people try and get it...Eric Benet really doesn't need to change and even if he doesn't change with the times, at least we will still continue to hold on to one of the best voices and true singers in this generation.

{"text": "Ken Elkinson is a composer and multi-instrumentalist based in Los Angeles, California. As a young adult, he was part of the competitive Classical piano circuit, who later studied Jazz and Pop piano, picking up guitar, bass, saxophone, clarinet and French horn along the way.  In college, Ken took classes in music composition, percussion, recording studio techniques and improvisation to enhance his music education.  It was during this time he began work on his first original Solo Piano CD, Midnight Conversation, which was released in 1997.After 9 solo piano albums, Ken Elkinson decided to begin composing ambient music, and the result is a new 6 CD box set entitled Music For Commuting.  Featuring 60 tracks and over 4 hours of music, Music For Commuting has 3 double length CDs which represent progressive days of the week.  The music was composed specifically to help calm drivers while commuting, but his calming music is well suited for massage, yoga, meditation, and academic studies.On this 6 CD collector's edition, Disc 1 Monday-Tuesday begins the work week in a deep and droning manner, as if shuttling the commuter through the hardest days of the week.  Disc 2 Wednesday-Thursday is much brighter while featuring upbeat, anthems and 1980's synth-pop elements.  Disc 3 is made for Friday and the weekend, taking the commuter into an enjoyable relaxing mode by spacey and futuristic music filled with a perfect sense of optimism.  Songs can be purchased by individual mp3 downloads.Music For Commuting is an all instrumental mix of Ambient, Chill Electronica and New Age music, but most are from an ambient perspective with lighter melodies.  All 60 songs blend beautifully into one another, and Ken performed every note you hear, so there was no instrumental programming involved during production.  Ken Elkinson instead used a combination of 8 keyboards and synthesizers on this value packed collector's edition CD which enables the listener to arrive at their destination in a calm and relaxed attitude.\n", "val": 0.008347681723535061}
{"text": "For years I have been searching for a perfect New Age album (besides Andy Summers' 1988 guitar-and-synthesizer classic Mysterious Barricades), and I believe I have finally found one in the form of Ken Elkinson's new release, Music for Commuting.Music for Commuting is really a series of 6 CDs, most beautifully packaged as a compact and easily portable box set of 3 CDs with two albums each. To paraphrase Elkinson's description of each two-album set, Disc 1: Monday/Tuesday is dark and edgy, Disc 2: Wednesday/Thursday is more buoyant and based on Elkinson's love of 1980s synth pop, and Disc 3: Friday/Beyond is spacey and futuristic.Regardless of these distinctions, the music on all six albums or three discs is really of one accord. Although there are latent guitar and percussion sounds on some tracks, the music is generated entirely with keyboards and synthesizers and sounds exactly like keyboards and synthesizers, and like Mysterious Barricades, the emphasis is on texture and sound, laced with beautiful melodies, tantalizing chord progressions, and ethereal chord washes.Even with such a single style and sound, each of the 60 tracks in the box set is original and unique, setting it apart from most other instrumental albums that need to mix up styles and genres to maintain interest. This is quite an impressive feat on Elkinson's part and speaks to his masterful compositional skills.The music itself functions on several levels. As the title suggests, it's perfect for commuting. It's also ideal for meditation and relaxation. It's intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually satisfying. It's akin to a religious experience. It would be a great soundtrack for a science fiction or fantasy movie.Listening to Music for Commuting is like swimming in an ocean of bliss. Its cascading layers of soothing sounds have the effect of mental therapy, like acupuncture for the mind. It is the epitome of pure New Age music and as a result is one of the best in the genre.\n", "val": 0.04065641760826111}
{"text": "Summary: I have enjoyed and programmed Ken Elkinson's New Age Instrumental piano solo CDs for many years now, but when a box set of 3 cds arrived, titled Music For Commuting Volumes 1-6, I was not sure I was going to get through 3+ hours of piano solos and maintain enough interest.  So it was a complete surprise to hear what played upon inserting the first disc.  Well crafted, engaging Ambient & Electronica sound bytes!  I use bytes because the 3 disc set contains 60 short (by current Ambient norms) 3-4 minute tracks (the longest track is 4:38), 20 per disc.  Obviously, this won't be anything like Robert Rich's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Somnium/dp/B00065EL7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Somnium</a>, or the typical soundscapes of Rudy Adrian, Between interval, Darshan Ambient, etc., and the majority of Ken's compositions are not quite that intricate, nor are they dark or brooding - more are airy and bright.  They are quite satisfying, however, and most will take you on a brief journey into a space or atmospheric realm of your choosing, or, when combined with the suggestion of the title, may evoke a new perspective on a specific segment of your commuting patterns.  The set is organized into Monday thru Friday volumes of 10 songs each (Monday & Tuesday on disc 1, Wed & Thur on disc 2, etc.), with the final 10 song theme volume titled \"beyond\"  including the intruging \"typewriter, dentist\" (beware that almost subliminal high speed drill).I am impressed with Ken's unexpected shift from the Ivorys to the synths.  While some ambient connoisseurs may shun the consistently short tracks, they are enjoyable nonetheless, with the only complaint that they may end a bit too soon after you have become immersed in the theme.  Noting that many tracks are, to me, reminiscent of earlier (1980s-1990s) electronic artists, one curiousity of mine is why Ken did not include the actual piano in at least some of these compositions because the closest comparison in that case may have been to perenial favorite Tim Story (\"Plateau\" in Vol. 2 comes closest to this sound).Genres (& sub genres): Ambient, New Age, Relaxation, Electronic, Space Music, ElectronicaListening Impressions: Tranquil, peaceful, relaxing, exciting, soaring, drifting, calming, reminiscent, harmoniusSimilar to: Michael Stribling, some aspects of Richard Bone, Alpha Wave Movement, and in Robert Rich's Catalogue: Geometry (1988);Many tracks are also reminiscent of earlier electronic music artists like Windsor Reily (The Move Of Life), Ray Lynch, Vangelis, Michael Genest, Peter Maunu & others.Notes from the artist: Ken will be donating a portion of the proceeds from this project to the ALS Association (fighting Lou Gehrig's Disease)\n", "val": 0.016217846423387527}
{"text": "Since I read a lot lately I love to put a few (up to 5) CDs in my CD player and then read for hours on end. Ken Elkinson's Music for Commuting could just as well be described as Music for Reading or Music for Relaxing. I've listened to the entire set while reading a Kindle book and then listened while falling asleep. I find the music especially relaxing so it is probably a good solution if you tend to feel road rage a lot while driving. Basically this set is filled with dreamy ambient landscapes of sound. The music is peaceful, calming, warm, soothing and can cause you to feel elation. This CD set would also be perfect if you like listening to music in the summer while you gaze up at the stars on a dark night.

{"text": "Choose any classical guitarist currently touring and Yang XueFei still stands out for her powerful and dramatic interpretive ability and unsurpassed technical agility.  Concerning dynamic range, she continues to expand the vocabulary for the guitar.  Notes are crisper, release is quicker, scalar motion is accelerated and punctuated by powerful but contained bursts.  Even among the great players, Yang pushes harder and dares more.  Through a multi-cultural approach to both execution and musical aesthetics she is refining and in some cases reinventing the technique on this instrument.  With this release, she amends the way we listen to Concierto de Arunjuez .This is a muscular and pellucid presentation; the 1st and 3rd movements are latticed more closely to the more famous 2nd movement through continuity of tone and attack. It is detailed and very direct throughout.  The crispness of Yang's playing allows the listener to experience each note in tight focus, as if one could see every drop in a waterfall of sound.  The orchestra is smoothly blended behind the guitar, but not subservient, truly working in concert.  XueFei Yang contributes a drive and technical fluency that provides sharp definition and a sense of momentum that unifies the 3 movements.Making its premiere is the Albeniz Concerto by Stephen Goss.  The composer has taken several themes from Isaac Albeniz' works for piano and orchestrated them into a concerto that retains the Romantic style of the originals while being a modern creation.  The cross-pollination of styles is engaging; Albeniz is always reworked in a guitar context anyway, being transcribed from piano scores, so in that sense, this is the biggest one yet as if the composer went from a small independent film to a big budget motion picture.  The special surprise is in the Cadenza (track 7).  While the orchestra rests, XueFei Yang works themes that reference not only Albeniz but also her earlier work with Goss.  Elements of \"Blue Kite\" and \"Farewell My Concubine\" appear briefly.  It is perhaps a clever reference, or warm reminiscence for these two collaborators.  It ties past work with present accomplishments, breaking the barrier of time as only music can do.The Albeniz Concerto is followed by several solo Albeniz pieces (Opus 165) that carry on the established flow.  Yang is able to find and accentuate abstract qualities while leaving the original totally intact, doing on solo guitar what Goss did with the preceding orchestral work, recognizing something modern contained in these 19th Century pieces.  The reworking is done as much through articulation as out-and-out rearrangement; it is still Romantic, with a 21st century sensibility.  XueFei Yang sounds like a local here, convincingly capturing the distinctiveness of Spanish style.\"Invocation y Danza\" is the closing track.  I haven't heard this played quite so dynamically before.  The sound board of her guitar is scarred from the heavy attack she can execute.  But she can also be extremely delicate.  She is much more so in either direction than most guitarists and the way it comes though here is to embolden the anticipation of this work, very exciting, very engrossing.Yang is technically awe-inspiring and different enough in her approach that it guarantees the listener hears things they have never heard before.  Considering the Arunjuez 2nd Movement's high profile in or out of classical music (thank you Miles Davis!), that is saying a lot.  Although Rodrigo is the name across the cover, this collection is more about the guitar concerto as an art form, and much of the content is Isaac Albeniz.  I think there are deeper studies of Rodrigo's work available, but what earns this CD 5 stars is the musicality and sheer force of creativity on every single track.  While you're at it, throw in a brand new guitar concerto.  XueFei Yang is an artist of rare vision, not only a champion of her instrument, but of music as a whole.\n", "val": 0.02522868663072586}
{"text": "I love this album. She delivers. The songs are consistently good and Jazmine proves that she is force to be reckoned with on this album. She has a voice like Mary J. mixed with Gladys Knight. She is truly a gift to a music industry that values looks over talent. What I like about Jazmine is that she knows who she is as an artist. R&B is her strong suite and she sticks to it so well it almost unbelievable.Here is a breakdown of each song...1. Holdin You Down- This songs takes us back to the 90s where people were really singing over beats meant for rappers. Jazmine takes us back to 1994 in the form of a more confident and strong version of Mary J. Blige. I love this track. 5/52. 10 Seconds- Jazmine is yelling on this track and I love it. The song is simple but strong. She gets extra points for the \"I'm going down\" intro. 5/53. Good Enough- It starts off with a confusing techno beat, but then it becomes a clear homage to the Prince era. The song is beautiful and takes us back to the 80s. 5/54. Don't Make Me Wait- You can't help but dance to this track. It sounds like a song that you skate to. Her voice is slightly higher than what I am used to, but still a great song. 4/55. Love You Long Time- This song sounds almost exactly like \"Foolish Heart\" from her last album but I absolutely love it. I can see this being a potential single. 5/56. Redemption- It reminds me of \"Call Me Guilty\" from \"Fearless\". The subject matter is a little too serious for me, but I can appreciate the sentiment. 3.5/57. Excuse Me- This is my song. I love it. It has so much soul and the lyrics are on point. It is all soul. 5/58. U Get On My Nerves- A standard Ne-Yo track. It's a little to popish for me, but I can see it getting stuck in my head. 4/59. Stuttering- Clearly the best track on the album. The piano is soft and Jazmine's vocals are just perfect. I could listen to this song all day. I love it. 6/510. Famous- Its a good song. Nothing too special about it. It's a filler track. 3.5/511. Luv Back- This song is a great way to end an album. The song is a pleasant surprise and I guarantee it will bring a smile to your face. It's reggae and R&B in its finest form. 5/5This album gets a 5/5 from me. I love Jazmine.

{"text": "Jazmine Sullivan returns with her sophomore album Love Me Back and it is an outstanding effort.  With a voice reminiscent of Mary J. Blige in terms of pure passion and emotion, she makes you feel every word she's singing.  She reemerged on the scene earlier this year with her single Going In Circles which was a throwback to 90's R&B but updated for 2010.  It's arguably her greatest song to date.  When she is singing about pain such as the second single 10 Seconds, she has that rare quality in her voice that is distinguishable and unique.  She's easily one of the most soulful artists to emerge in the past 5 years.  True soul music.The album delivers on that premise with song after song of great arrangements, soulful singing, and great lyrics.  She brings out her inner 80's on Don't Make Me Wait and Ne-Yo serves as the only guest on the duet U Get On My Nerves.  The only songs I'm not really feeling are Love You Long Time & Redemption, not because they are horrible songs it's just that I'm not really feeling their vibe.Jazmine Sullivan comes through with another solid effort that showcases her talents and is thoroughly enjoyable.  She is a true talent in music and this album is worth a purchase as it has powerful songs with plenty of replay value.  She has that voice that makes your hair stand up in the back of your neck. You definitely won't be disappointed with this album if you are a fan of Jazmine or quality R&B/Soul music.  4.4 Stars.\n", "val": 0.0476972758769989}
{"text": "November 30th, 20101. Holdin' You Down (Going In Circles) - An anthem-like song that features a bit of heartbreak. We've all heard said song this summer/fall. A-2. Ten Seconds - A nice song about wanting a guy to get out of your face because he broke your heart. Nice production. B-3. Good Enough - This track is amazing and has grown on me immensely. It's kind of emotional and gets you right in the heart. A4. Don't Make Me Wait - A fun, playful 80's-sounding song. Catchy and grows on you. B+5. Love You Long Time - My man Salaam Remi who produced and co-wrote the excellent \"Lions, Tigers & Bears\" got all over this track too. Obviously the best song on the album, it has an upbeat demeanor and feels like a love letter sent to one *REALLY* lucky guy. Sorta like Mariah's \"I'll Be Lovin' You Long Time\" in subject matter, but just think better song. Hot marching drum sounds. A+6. Redemption - A track kinda like \"Call Me Guilty\" from 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fearless/dp/B001CJOHG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fearless</a>&nbsp;but even darker. Has a hip-hop beat and the gospel-inspired chorus is a real highlight. A-7. Excuse Me - I love the feel to this one because it really, really sounds old-school vocally and production-wise. A true standout. B+8. U Get On My Nerves (Feat. Ne-Yo) - A cool duet idea between two relatively new artists. Not the strongest track here but has an extremely addictive albeit simple piano arrangement that will get stuck in your head if you pay attention. B+9. Stuttering - The repetitive nature of the chorus can get annoying, but probably not overly so. Still a great track. Nice and simple piano riff fills the air. B+10. Famous - I see this song's point especially vocally, but I didn't love it on initial listen because it's also repetitive. But what strikes me now and caused me to change the grade from a \"C+\" is because of its strong, emotional tone. B-11. Luv Back - \"Luv Back\" features sort of an island/reggae sound in production and a happy vibe even though it's essentially a break-up song. It will have you singing along. A+12. In Vain (iTunes Pre-order track) - This track took a long, long time to grow on me. At first it doesn't really seem like it goes anywhere so those of you who didn't get it, it's all good. It's good, but not great. Anthony Bell did a KILLER, \"A\" effort song on the debut called \"In Love With Another Man\" with Jazmine and this song is no comparison. B- (not available for sale anywhere now).**********************So may I start with the cover art? Can you say fierce? I freakin' love it! It makes me think of the older days with the leather jacket, boots and the classic model car.Anyway, this is an excellent album like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fearless/dp/B001CJOHG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fearless</a>. And although I didn't think it surpassed it in quality at first, it definitely has now. It has a slew of excellent songs and absolutely no average or dreadful songs to be found here. The producers also worked the tracks out here especially \"Excuse Me\", \"U Get On My Nerves\" and \"Good Enough\" which happens to have the best intro on the album.I love this woman!! Her voice! Her choice in genre! Her lyrics! I will buy her next album and support her because that's what I do: support artists I really enjoy that put in hard work AND make superb albums. Any of you who are slightly disheartened by any negative reviews, don't be: you will love this album. I'm sure of it.I hope you guys liked my review and I'm so glad I was one of the first to put it up. Jazmine Sullivan's music is close to my heart because she's so honest like myself and she's just fun to listen to. Oh, and did I mention THAT VOICE? Definitely the craziest vocals on Urban radio right now.(This review has been updated a few times since it's creation)\"A-\", 4.6 stars or an 9.2/10.

{"text": "Jazmine Sullivan's multi-Grammy nominated debut \"Fearless\" criss-crossed the musical spectrum from Soul to Hip Hop to Reggae to Dance to acoustic pieces. \"Love Me Back\" is her sophomore disc and her throaty soaring vocals are on full display on songs like the retro Soul talk-to-the-hand Salaam Remi-produced ballad \"10 Seconds\" or the groovy upbeat \"Don't Make Me Wait\" which sounds like it dropped from the eighties.Other standouts are the Missy Elliott-produced Hip Hop-laced \"Holding You Down\", the spectacular Gospel-tinged \"Redemption\" (which finds Sullivan rapping the part of a crack addict, as well as a male woman-beater), the gorgeous ballad \"Excuse Me\" (which samples The Manhattans), duetting with Ne-Yo on the bitter break-up piano ballad \"U Get On My Nerves\", \"Famous\" (where she talks about her pre-stardom dreams and how she wants to inspire girls to want to be like her, to be somebody, against sweeping strings, squealing guitars, and a spare backdrop - think \"Dream Big\" from her debut), and the Dancehall hand clap-infused \"Luv Back\".A worthy follow-up to her spectacular debut.\n", "val": 0.019583702087402344}

{"text": "After winning an astonishing and impressive 7 Grammy nominations for her debut, \"Fearless\", ironically La Sullivan duplicated India. Aire in that manner, wisely snipes an opening 8 bars almost directly from Mary J. Blige's \"Be Happy\" for her first single, \"Holding Me Down (Goin' in Circles)\" from her sophomore release. For months, it seems, I couldn't get the line \"why can't I find somebody else, when I know....\", out of my iPod brain head. I had been intrigued at La Jazmine 's success in garnering so many Grammy nods from her solid, but, certainly not groundbreaking commercial reaction to her debut. It seemed everytime that song came on in the shuffle mode.....it caught my attention. There  was artistic achievement of sorts in her 4th single, \"Lions, Tigers and Bears\", she had co-wrote and co-produced with Salaami Remi. That song took the famous coupling from \"The Wizard of Oz\" that made noise at, of all formats, Urban Contemporary radio.\n", "val": 0.006484530866146088}

{"text": "An artist's sophomore album is often the one where they truly come into their own, and can show off who they are as an artist. It is very rare that the second effort is just as powerful as the debut, and it is the mark of an amazing artist who is able to pull that off. Luckily, Jazmine Sullivan is one of those rare artists who continues the momentum of her debut with her 2010 album, Love Me back. Jazmine is one of the rare artists whose voice alone evokes emotion, making every performance sound personal and passionate. She also marks herself as an artist who is truly \"fearless\", as her debut title suggested, taking several risks with her new material which nearly always pay off. Although this album is neither as instant, nor as haunting, as her debut, it is an excellent follow-up and one that continues to mark Jazmine as an artist to watch.Lead single \"Holding You Down\" immediately showcases Jazmine's incredible voice over track reminiscent of 90s R&B. Despite containing multiple samples, courtesy of Missy Elliott serving as producer, Jazmine easily makes it her own. Although it is not as instantly catchy as debut single \"Bust Your Windows\", it certainly matches anything on her debut in terms of quality. Second single \"10 Seconds\" takes on more of the haunting quality that permeated much of Jazmine's debut, as she sings about her giving her man ten seconds to leave after he mistreats her. Jazmine delivers an extremely passionate performance, with just the right balance of anger with a touch of sadness. The bridge is particularly strong.  \"Good Enough\" depicts Jazmine at her most independent, telling a man that she refuses to waste her time on someone that does not appreciate her. The lyrics are relatively simple and straightforward, doing an excellent job of showcasing the song's message. It's a creative take on a break-up song, with the woman acknowledging that she's been unappreciated yet simultaneously realizing that she can, and will, do better.\"Don't Make Me Wait\" is the album's first truly upbeat track, and a fan favourite likely due to the similarities to Prince. Although it is not a personal favourite, it is a nice change of pace that keeps the album from becoming too dark. The track does get repetitive in places, but Jazmine's delivery keeps it strong. \"Love You Long Time\" is another of the album's less memorable tracks, but it is quite a strong filler track. This is one of the rare songs where Jazmine truly sounds happy, focusing on a relationship that is going well. The main problem with this song is that the production is slightly too busy, and almost overwhelms Jazmine's voice which is not an easy feat given how powerful a singer she is. Although it does not necessarily stand out on its own, it is far from a weak track. \"Redemption\" is another truly haunting track, and one that was quite a big risk. Jazmine nearly raps the verses before belting the chorus, singing about finding redemption for one's mistakes. It is lyrically quite a powerful track, yet as a concept/storyline song it is one that many fans might not appreciate. Like it or not, Jazmine should definitely be credited for her creativity and the fact that was willing to take such a large risk.\"Excuse Me\" is Jazmine's first proper love ballad, and it easily proves that she can shine just as much on happy songs as on her darker tracks. Both vocally and lyrically, it does not quite compare to some of her strongest work, however it certainly proves her to be versatile with her subject matter. Her passionate delivery makes her just as believable on a love song as it is on tracks about anger or heartbreak. \"U Get On My Nerves\", a duet with Ne-Yo, is a bittersweet break-up song in the form of a dialogue between the two singers. This is one of the most highly criticized tracks for everything from a supposed lack of chemistry between the singers, and for sounding much too \"polished\" for Jazmine. Although the rawness of her voice is toned down, it does not detract from her ability to evoke emotion. This track is an unexpected standout, and a personal favourite. Despite the complaints, there does seem to be vocal chemistry between the singers, making the track truly believable. \"Stuttering\" is another rather risky track, where Jazmine literally stutters some of the lyrics. The concept behind this song is that something about a man renders Jazmine nearly speechless, so that when she tries to speak, she ends up stuttering. Luckily, her risk once again pays off to become one of the album's stronger tracks, despite some lyrical weakness. Her vocal performance on this track is more subdued than usual, yet retains its usual passion. It is a creative, somewhat gimmicky, track which ends up working, particularly on the powerful bridge.\"Famous\" is yet another highlight, and a personal favourite. Any artist who sings about fame runs the risk of sounding self-centred. However, Jazmine manages to craft a masterful track that truly sounds genuine and even relatable, with vocals that can give chills. Where other artists use songs about fame to complain about the constant attention or to brag about what they have, Jazmine instead describes the desire for fame and to be important. Although this is by far the longest track on the album, Jazmine easily manages to keep it fresh throughout so that it never seems to drag on. This track is truly Jazmine at her best. Despite \"Famous\" appearing to be the perfect closing track for the album, Jazmine is never one to end her albums on a serious note. Carrying on in a similar vein to \"Switch\" from her debut, Jazmine closes off this album with the fun, reggae-tinged \"Luv Back\". This track brings the album full-circle. Where \"Holding You Down\" described Jazmine questioning why she keeps going back to a troubled relationship, \"Luv Back\" has her telling a man that she's completely over him and moved on. This track once again proves that Jazmine is just as strong on upbeat and happier tracks as she is with her darker material.Overall Mark: 4.5/5Only two albums into her career, Jazmine Sullivan has already established herself as a force to be reckoned with. Both albums so far have been true showcases of her numerous talents as a singer and a songwriter. Love Me Back builds on all of the strengths of Jazmine's debut, especially her ability to take risks with her music. Jazmine is unafraid to try new things with her songs, and more often than not, they work well. The only problem with taking so many risks is that it makes the album a little less cohesive in places, with certain tracks (\"Don't Make Me Wait\" for instance), sounding a bit out of place. Jazmine still does somewhat better on her darker material than the love ballads, however even the weaker tracks on the album are solid quality. Her passion and ability to evoke emotion from even the simplest lyrics certainly help to make even the weaker tracks sound believable. It will certainly be interesting to see what Jazmine will come out with next.\n", "val": 0.03518722578883171}

{"text": "The first track off of Jazmine's sophomore release is sassy, classy and without a doubt an up-tempo classic. \"Holding You Down\" is the opener of a well credited sense of artistry. It is an understatement to label this artist as underrated. This album kicks off with an urban feel and old skool vibe rejuvenated. \"10 Seconds\" is a song that stands the test of time as vocally competitive in the R+B industry. The third track \"Good Enough\" sounds like a cross between Jennifer Hudson & Fantasia...not bad at all. The vocals are descent but yet sultry. \"Love You Long Time\" is her standout performance on the CD, great song, and great voice. Sullivan is the true meaning of \"It\". She has star power and demonstrates her versatility throughout her sophomore effort. The song \"Redemption\" isn't anything to jump and brag about. It is more like mediocre quality music. This album doesn't match the Grammy nominated impact of her debut release. Tracks like \"Stuttering\" and \"Famous\" just take up unnecessary space on the album.

{"text": "The lead single of this project, HOLDING YOU DOWN (GOIN' IN CIRCLES)was released last summer and it instantly became a favorite of mine with great use of a sample and a modernized old school feel.  The second single, 10 SECONDS, was released a few months after and featured a soulfully smoldering performance by Jazmine as she calls out a cheating lover.I thought both singles and they accompanying videos were excellent and hoped that they had created enough \"buzz\" to increase interest in the album upon release.  Unfortunately the album wasn't released until December and shortly after disappointing low sales, Jazmine announced on Twitter that she was quitting the music business (which she later recanted - thankfully).  As an r&b music lover, I understand her pain & frustration about the status of this genre of music but I also believe that if more artists like Jazmine continue to release music that is more soul rather than hip hop/soul, eventually the pendulum will swing back to a place where she and other singers like her are more appreciated.I enjoy this album as much as her debut - there are ballads I love that showcase her voice as well as uptempo songs on which she smooths out the raw soul of her voice to fit more \"pop-oriented\" production.  Overall the only 2 songs that I still don't like are: U GET ON MY NERVES w/ Ne-Yo - the track is just \"ok\" when I hoped for a magical duet between the two voice & FAMOUS - I appreciate the plaintive, honest lyrics but the arrangement of the song makes it difficult to listen to.Other favorites (in addition to the two singles already released) are:DON'T MAKE ME WAIT - uptempo track with an 80's retro beatGOOD ENOUGH - the synthy opening of this ballad segues into a Prince-sounding track with Jazmine's emotional & raw vocalsSTUTTERING & EXCUSE ME - smoky balladsLOVE YOU LONG TIME - interesting military drum beats used on this uptempo track make it interestingREDEMPTION SONG - great storytelling lyrics, Jazmine raps then goes into a killer chorusI wish her label would release one more track but sadly these days r&b artists usually only release 1 or 2 tracks and then we hear that the artist is \"working on the next album\" - they just don't take time to groom artists or \"grow\" their music anymore if it doesn't crossover to the mainstream charts.To Jazmine, as a fan I say, please stay strong and continue to release good music!\n", "val": 0.0029289093799889088}

There are not many female R&B vocalists of her era who can hold a candle to her voice. Compare her voice to someone like Jennifer Hudson. Of course, Jennifer's voice is overall stronger, but I said that in order to paint a picture for it to be understood just how strong her voice is.\"Love Me Back\" is a good album. I graded it 3.5 out of 5. The only song that sticks out in my mind after listening, though, is \"Good Enough.\" I heard this song one time and fell in love with it. That song? Now that is what I call music! The production is wonderful (Prince's \"Beautiful Ones\" is sampled), her vocals are great and the lyrics are quite profound. The message is if a man will not love you right, another man will be happy to. It's a beautiful, quality track and the standout moment of the 11 tracks. Missy Elliot can be found hollering randomly on the album. I really wish she and Jermaine Dupri would stop doing that. Enough is enough. \"Don't Make Me Wait\" has a great uptempo beat. It's another track inspired by the one and only Prince.Nothing groundbreaking or especially innovative here beside her creative lyrics.

Granted, I am not in the demographic target for this material, but honestly, I found these songs boring and derivative.I still think Ms. Sullivan has talent, but she really, really needs to work with some good musicians and (forgive me for being snide) perhaps to take music lessons.  There is a vast difference between artists who understand music and instrumentation (Luther Vandross, Maurice White, John Legend and Jill Scott to name a few great soul singer/musicians) and singers who simply have nice voices.\"Good Enough\" is probably the best song on the album and a great anthem for young women, but all in all there's nothing here to keep me listening.\n", "val": 0.0004659396654460579}

{"text": "Although this albums R&B influence span nearly three decades \"Love Me Back\" certainly pulls it all together and achieves impressive cohesion.  The uniformity of the Album can mainly be attributed to Jazmine's consistently outstanding vocal work. The only minor drawback is that production is possibly not quite contemporary. I would have loved to have seen a song produced by some current industry leaders such as T-Pain or Timbaland. Still most of the tracks are worth repeated listening. Mostly I found myself admiring the rare combination of finesse and power of Jazmine's vocals, and yet with all that skill she still manages to bare her soul. Possibly my favorite track is the retro styled \"Excuse Me\" produced by Missy and Sullivan and Cainon Lamb, followed by the debut track \"Holding You Down(goin in circles). The Waltz inspired Salam Remi teams up with Sullivan again for \"10 Seconds\" after creating an fan favorite \"lion's Tigers and Bears\" on her Debut album. Prince's and Aretha Franklin's 80's sound imprint happen to show up in track's like \"Good enough\"  and \"Don't Make me Wait\". Jazmine's impeccable timing is a plus and everything works here for me.

The music industry is severely lacking in artists with such ability and talent as jazmine.  I haven't listened to the radio in a year now because I'm so so sick of the crap that gets played.  Why is every song on the radio about cars, diamonds, alcohol, booties, and how much money or how 'cool' the singer is?  Soo over it.  That's why to listen to this album I actually felt this huge relief like it was filling this huge gaping hole in my life.  We spend on average 2 hours a day in our cars and music is really what gets me by and for the last year I've been listening to the same songs on repeat in my car because the crap out there really just isn't worth listening to.

{"text": "This is a solid/fantastic CD release by the talented R n' B superstar Jazmine Sullivan titled \"Love Me Back\". The great opening track is \"Holding You Down (Goin' In Circles)\" : great track with great (music, vocals & rapping). This song does give a good glimpse of what is in this great CD : great joyride, fun & when all is said and done, you'll \"Love Jazmine Sullivan Back\" for the love she dishes out on this CD! Other great tracks include \"10 Seconds\", \"Don't Make Me Wait\" (very soulful track with great vocals & great guitar), \"Love You Long Time\" (great al cappella intro & great drumkit sound) & \"Excuse Me\" (very soulful track with great vocals). Okay/good tracks include \"Redemption\" (good rapping), \"Stuttering\" (great bass/piano combination) & \"Famous\". Solid tracks/gems include \"Good Enough\" (fantastic soulful laid-back track with great techno intro), \"U Get On My Nerves\" (wonderful R n' B track with great vocals intro by Ne-Yo, beautiful harmonies with Jazmine Sullivan & chorus) & \"Luv Back\" (a fantastic closing track with a beautiful melody & chorus. This is the title track for this CD with great techo/keyboard sound. This is also my favourite track from this wonderful CD). On overall, I was blown away by the unique & fantastic vocals of the talented Jazmine Sullivan, got much much more fantastic music than I expected, a highly recommended CD.

{"text": "One thing that I don't like about today's music is that it's geared toward the lowest common denominator: sex, or the act itself. Now, I'm not a prude by any means, but shouldn't a song leave a lot to the listener's imagination? That's why a lot of the 'old school' singers from 25-50 years ago could make songs that actually hold up better today than most of the pre-fabricated, over produced slop that infects popular music, especially R&B today.Sullivan's music is what is needed today: you still acknowledge today's styles and what not, but you still work on the main thing: making the song memorable and letting the listener fills in the blanks so to speak.She is pretty, that is no doubt. But, I'm more impressed with her singing qualities and her song writing skills, because she'll need those qualities if she wants to be a long lasting star, after she's not the hot young singer of the moment.I think that she'll last a long time if she keeps on doing what she's doing: making sure her voice, writing, and talent always take center stage.\n", "val": 0.0036527563352137804}

I really like the fact that she has live instrumentation on her songs too..such classic and original feel..without the use of drum machines to rely on making \"music\". When there are usage of a drum machine on some tracks...it's not used as a reliance and handicap to make a song..its more a tribute to a time...like the previously stated songs..they give you that back in the day feel...but feels modern in the same sense.Redemption and Famous have very nice lyrics and make you think.Recommended...hope it sells big\n", "val": 0.02189023047685623}

{"text": "Jazmine Sullivan is certainly a force to be reckoned with. She amazed us with her vocals and unique style displayed in her freshman release \"Fearless\" and for those of us who have been waiting for more, she brought it with Love Me Back.1. Holding You Down(Goin' In Circles):In her first single from this album Jazmine once again presents a situation in which she's stuck loving a man that doesn't treat her right. Love the old school type beat it kind of makes you forget this is a somewhat solemn song, her vocals are amazing as usual, raw and honest.2. 10 Seconds: This is the second single released from \"Love Me Back\" This song is about a woman that's pretty much fed up with her man's BS and telling him he's gotta go. Again, a great vocal performance by Jazmine.3. Good Enough: This is one of my favorite songs on the album. Its an 80's type beat, the style reminds you of a Prince(Artist formerly known as)song. Song is basically saying how everything she does is not good enough for this person so she won't waste her time trying to please them. \"Baby I don't wanna waste my time, changing how you feel. If you don't want me, someone else will.\" -Amen to that lol4. Don't Make Me Wait: another 80's style beat but the mood of the album changes here to be a little more playful and seductive. Jazmine show's her sexy side in this track. She knows what she wants and she's gonna go for it. I still cannot figure out what she's saying in this part of the lyrics \"Don't make me wait too long, Just play my favorite song, I'll??????\" oh well, still love it.5. Love You Long Time: Another one of my favorites Track starts off a capella, very playful mood to this song. Pretty much a song about how the person she's with makes her feel and how she wants to be with him a 'long time'. Love the percussion and the harmonies in this song. Something about it makes you smile, it makes me want to dance in the mirror every time I hear it lol.6. Redemption: This song is kind of misplaced to me it changes the mood to a serious tone. The title pretty much speaks for itself, over a hip hop beat,Jazmine tells two stories in this song from each person's perspective. Stories of falling and finding redemption at a turning point. The chorus is where she shines most, Jazmine 'takes us to church' and speaks to each listener with this prayer-like song.7. Excuse Me: Jazmine certainly shines brightest in the ballads and this one is no different, it does not disappoint. This song switches the mood back to the sultry seductive sounding vocals. Nice serenade to the person she's been looking for and finally found.8. U Get On My Nerves: Again a misplaced track but a nice duet with Ne-Yo pretty much a conversation between two people who have recently broken up and gone their seperate ways. Bitter sweet lyrics, mid tempo beat, overall an ok track.9. Stuttering: Slowing it down a little, this track is very sweet melodically and lyrically. Makes you remember your high school crush. Definitely a light mood to this song, and we can each relate to the story being told.10. Famous: Very modern sound to this track. Jazmine's vocals definitely take center stage on this track. \" No one wants to be invisible, Everyone just wants to be seen.\" A song about the desire to be Famous, a dream shared by many. Love the string accompaniment in this, very beautiful.11. Luv Back: The most up beat song on the album, has a reggae feel to it. Love the lyrics and the beat, another one that you can't help but sing along and dance to.12. In Vain: I actually didn't care for this track very much the first time I listened but it grows on you a little at a time. Very slow tempo, which is probably the initial reason I couldn't get into it. Bitter sweet song telling the man that's left her for another woman that she hopes she was worth it and leaving her was not in vain. Its still growing on me, Jazmine's vocals are the only thing this song really has going for it.Overall its a great sophomore release, good variety, I love the old school hip hop feel, the 80's type R&B, and the more contemporary feel. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Fearless.\n", "val": 0.01162248756736517}

{"text": "Well upon listen to her first album \"Fearless\" I was kinda like she can sing and she can sing against a variety of styles of music, but where is the story?  I mean it had a few cuts that were great \"Lions, Tigers, & Bears\"; \"In Love With Another Man\"; & \"Guilty\" which told a tale.  For the most part though it was a bit disjointed for my ears.  This album though was thorough and the songs seem to go much more together.  They cover a spectrum of emotion not styles of music.  I am a person that says ok show something different as a suprise, not the entire project.  I am really feeling this album.  Only draw-back is that there is a song called \"In Vain\" which is a good song, (not as good as \"In Love With Another Man\" which was written by the same writer)was only available through an iTunes pre-order.  Still got it though should have just been a deluxe option instead of just for iTunes.  Overall though very pleased and money well spent.

She cracks me up on her 10 Seconds video on U-Tube(my fav channel). I'm glad the guy was only dreaming and she didn't do it forreal, b/c she said she really did bust the windows out her ex car. I think her whole album is good, and I will be adding it to my collection. I saw Jazmine Sullivan on Wendy Williams, and she knocked 10 Seconds out, even Wendy Williams was dazed. Wendy Williams  is off the charts with the questions she ask her guest, for instance \"are you dating?, are you getting any? and other question that I feel is not really her business, but Wendy as of late seem to be toning it down a bit.

{"text": "Jazmine Sullivan knows about heartbreak. But she also knows about true love. Making this the perfect album for any R&B fan.On her debut album, Sullivan made sure that people knew she could sing anything, and makes sure to work with top name producers who can let her voice and emotion soar through the song. This second time around, she keeps it simple, doing everything exactly the same. But this time, she sounds better, and makes a well made album.Starting with the Missy Elliott produced \"Holding you Down (Goin in Circles)\" and Salaam Remi's \"10 Seconds\", Jazmine sings about the same thing she has been singing about: love lost and betrayal. But it doesn't get old. Both of these producers, who have worked with her before, know the best of Jazmine and bring it out in both these singles. Jazmine sounds amazing in both, and they are the best songs on the album.The album containes contemporary R&B songs, but also the funky \"Don't Make Me Wait\" and the reggae-tinged \"Luv Me Back\". Every song has beautiful melodies, and excellent writing, and can be listened to completely.The only song I believe doesn't fit in the album is \"Redemption\". It is a song that describes drug addiction, domestic abuse, and weapon violence. It is a well written song, and inspirational in a way, but it does not fit in the album, with its theme and music as well.Overall, the album is amazing, and newcomers and fans alike will find something to love on every track.

{"text": "I have uneven feelings about Jazmine Sullivan's sophomore effort, Love Me Back.The current standard of laptop-style production sounds cheesey  when paired with Sullivan's superior vocal ability. A live studio recording session with real musicians seems more suited for  her misguided and under-used talents. Just on the heels of her 2009 CD Fearless, this release is a rushed ill-conceived effort. It pales in comparison to her CD debut. I think more time should have been devoted in the development of this project.The two single releases off this project, the Grammy nominated, \"Going In Circles\" and \"10Seconds\" are the best  tracks. I also favor \"Redemption\" for its' vocal arrangement and storytelling elements. It should be considered as third single release.  But, Sullivan's duet with the popular Ne-Yo is likely to be the third single to garner heavy rotation radio airplay. That song really gets on \"my damn nerves, damn nerves\"!Too often today's music results in good voice presented with bad material. I hope Sullivan's futureprojects will be more creative with time invested. This incomplete and rushed sophomore CD could've been great. But, it is just OK.\n", "val": 0.00011859933874802664}
{"text": "So, I purchased Jazmine's freshman album Fearless on its first day out at Wal-Mart retailers in 2008. My then college roommate and I instantly fell in love, and played that cd out in our dorm room until our neighbors begged us to switch cd's or at least keep Jazzy's turned down to a respectable volume (we did neither..we were too addicted). Like many artists who stand out, I eagerly anticipated her second album. However to my disappointment 2009 came and NO album... 2010 came and still NOTHING (super heartbroken)..BUT FINALLY as 2010 approaches a close and we prepare to enter into 2011 Jazmine's Cd \"LOVE ME BACK\" drops, and INSTANTLY I find myself falling in love with Ms. Sullivan's music all over again...Jazmine's eccentric, soulful, and unique voice expertly belches out note after note on every track on \"Love me Back\"  more than likely prompting each of her fans to utilize the repeat function on their various listening devices to play the album repeatedly over the next several months and years to come (or at least till her junior album drops :-)The cd is a compilation of songs that depict everything from independence and triumph, to love, and then love loss. Many songs leave it's listeners with a sense of strength and increased self - worth, as songs highlight several momentous obstacles in relationships and life, be it overcoming heart break, or simply perseverance despite it ALL (whatever \"IT\" may be)The cd is on my computer, phone, and iPod, and is constantly playing at work, in the car, the gym, and at home. Simply said I can't get enough..and prayerfully this exceptional artist doesn't leave her fans wanting more for another 2 years before her Junior album drops. Simply put this is one of the BEST albums of the year, no no DECADE..and the only downfall I could find is that the cd is only 40 minutes long, which leaves each listener wanting more. I pray for a 15 track album and at least an hour worth of music the next time around! But until then I'll keep playing this album until each song literally becomes a part of me.

{"text": "This is the personification of a Solid Sophomore Effort. Jazmine Sullivan, or shall I say Ms. Sullivan, hit a home run with this album, as she did with her debut album 'Fearless.' Jazmine has a unique voice and she uses it to the full and this is what makes her music so good. I bought her debut album 'Fearless' and it appears that she still is.....'Fearless' because the music sounds even better! It is timeless music that sounds like it's effortless for her to produce.1. Holding You Down (Goin' In Circles) \"It has that: `You got me under your spell' vibe. This is the first single and it is a song that makes you want to dance like you've never danced before; this song samples from Mary J. Blige's song `Be Happy.'\"2. 10 Seconds \"The 2nd Single and it is a blazing track that depicts the climax of problems within a relationship. This song also has a beat sample from Mary J. Blige's song: `I'm Goin' Down.'\"3. Good Enough \"If you don't want me, someone else will! Jazmine sets an ultimatum for her lover in this song: `If I'm not good enough for you, hit the door and I will be good for someone else.'\"4. Don't Make Me Wait \"Funky, upbeat song that has a Vanity 6 vibe.\"5. Love You Long Time \"This song makes you bounce when you hear it. It's an upbeat song about the opportunity to love, love for a long time.\"6. Redemption \"This is the dramatic song on the album, it reminds me of `Call Me Guilty' from the 'Fearless' album.\"7. Excuse Me \"A ballad about self-expression.\"8. U Get On My Nerves Duet With Ne-Yo \"A hot duo about a relationship that is beyond over.\"9. Stuttering \"This is a song about a nervous crush.\"10. Famous \"The pros and cons of becoming Famous! Sang it Jazmine!\"11. Luv Back \"This is the Reggae joint on the CD, once you lose love it is hard to get it back.\"Overall, the album receives an A+. Jazmine get your gown ready for the Grammy's because you and your extremely talented label mates, and might I add: FELLOW GRAMMY NOMINEES, Fantasia and Monica will be in the house along with you anxiously waiting to hear the results. You all deserve to win! Real R&B hit hard in 2010 and the world better stand up and recognize. In my opinion, you're a winner already by just being nominated, that's an honor. Keep making real music Jazmine, keep reaching our hearts, and we will never have a problem to `Love You Back' because you show this love to us by giving us the gift of music.\n", "val": 0.029000837355852127}

Well rounded and crafted with chilling vocal performances by Sullivan,  `Love Me Back' is both creative and retro, blending old and new styles together well.  There are no misses or songs that find the vocalist ever choking as `Love Me Back' proves to be nearly flawless and finds Sullivan improving as a vocalist if anything.  While it will always be `Fearless's' \"Bust Your Windows\" that defines the rise of this star, she has continued her upswing strongly on this exceptionally well thought out second effort.\"Holding You Down (Goin' In Circles)\" should come over as extremely clumsy given its manic production, but instead, Sullivan `holds down' the multiple samplings and gimmicks of the production extremely well.  Vocally, Sullivan is perfect with a well nuanced performance and solid songwriting, most notable on the soulful hook: \"I Keep going in circles, circles/round and round/and while you're doing me so wrong/I just keep holding you down/ I feel so stupid, foolish/loving you this way/But what can I say/But I wanna go/I wanna go/but I keep coming back.\" On the equally sound \"10 Seconds\" (another track built around soulful sampling), the production is superb and Sullivan absolutely KILLS it with her soulful vocals.  Again, superb songwriting serves as the buttress, particularly on the intelligent chorus once again: \"one, two, three (four!)/five, six seven (ooh)/eight, nine, baby I'm getting closer...\"  Sullivan is two for two; 2-0.\"Good Enough\" is a nice change of pace as far as production work.  Here, Sullivan achieves great attitude.  The bridge may be the highlight as it serves as an `epic' moment.  \"Don't Make Me Wait\" is a departure for Sullivan, finding her singing over a neo-disco groove - something we've never heard from her before.  The production is solid and while the vocal parts may be written the slightest bit too fast-paced, it is another solid, noteworthy performance.  Similarly, \"Love You Long Time\" features big drums that provide a rhythmic driven production work.  A short performance, the cut packs enough punch with superbly commanding vocals by its muse.\"Redemption\" is an oddity, but also a personal favorite.  Sullivan opens up the track rapping and instantly gives the impression that there is a `story' behind this cut.  She brings it all together on a soulful, gospel laden hook in which she asks the Lord to \"... hear the sinner's prayer.\"  By the bridge section, Jazmine's soulful vocals take over and captivate making this both one of the album's anomalies and highlights.  \"Excuse Me\" may be the very best moment of the album - `the crowning achievement' of `Love Me Back.' Here again, a sampling approach to the production work helps to `amp up' the soulfulness of the performance.Sullivan follows-up the valedictory \"Excuse Me\" with \"U Get On My Nerves\" featuring Ne-Yo, a fine duet.  The chemistry between the vocalists is unquestionable.  On \"Stuttering,\" Sullivan once again shocks with a gimmicky performance, but not like the rest of contemporary R&B these days; even with her use of gimmicks, it seems more soulful and classy than other artists who couldn't pull this off.  \"Famous\" features a fine driving (rather pounding) beat.  \"Famous\" is not the best of the album, but with such a consistent effort as this, it is by no means bad. Closing cut \"LUV Back\" is a surprising uptempo cut to close the album.  The production is spastic, but do we expect any less from the creative, cerebral production of Missy Elliott? (The Answer is a rhetorical `no' by the way.)Overall, `Love Me Back' is another fine addition to the R&B discography of 2010.  Let's face it - this girl can `sang.' It is a shame that R&B has became so based on `trends' that we fail to honor those new singers that are avoiding gimmicks for nuanced, complete vocals performances like Sullivan, Chrisette Michele, etc.  Exceptional effort!\n", "val": 0.01721510849893093}

{"text": "The first time I heard My Chemical Romance, it was on the radio. It was their breakthrough single, \"I'm Not Okay(I Promise)\", and I took the title quite seriously. They were not okay. They were actually quite not good at all.However, when they released their 2006 album, \"The Black Parade\", a friend played it for me and I was instantly interested. It was a wonderful connection between classic rock allusions and influences mixed with the Misfits. It even had a storyline, though it was nearly impossible to follow passingly (like most concept albums). I was eager to ehar what they did next, and over the course of the next four years \"The Black Parade\" was constantly in my CD player and on my iPod.Needless to say, when I heard lead off single \"Na Na Na\", I was pretty floored. It was a pretty righteous song, all quick guitars and nonsense, but fun, lyrics and possibly the best solo of the last few years. It was, and is, a terrific rock song. I was now eagerly excited to hear what came next.\"Danger Days\" does not disappoint any of my expectations, which were already pretty lofty. It is a fun, tight record with a pretty nifty comic book concept and more than a fair share of killer tunes. Like \"The Black Parade\" this is a big, shiny rock record with bigger hooks, with some of the songs, specifically \"Sing\", \"Summertime\" and \"The Kids from Yesterday\", begging to be played live in large arenas. \"Planetary (Go!)\" is downright funky, a truly danceable track with some pretty funny and clever lyrics to boot. \"S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W\" features the records most mega chorus, and the garage punk tunes \"Party Poison\" and \"Vampire Money\" succesfully call out garage bands of the past while still putting a special My Chem spin on the genre. Occasionally the group falter, most notably on the boring \"Save Yourself\" and \"DESTROYA\", two tracks that failed to leave any discernable impression on me after repeated listens.Musically the record is more melodic and keyboard driven than any of the bands previous records, but this style fits the band perfectly. Where their earlier records (which I went back and have a passing interest in as time has gone by) were more aggressive, and \"The Black Parade\" was pretty melodic and epic, \"Danger Days\" mixes the two while adding tighter songcraft. Lyrically the record is strong, and features some of lead singer Gerad Way's best lyrics to date.I enjoyed \"Danger Days\" fully. It's a tight, well constructed rock record that's as much fun to listen to as I assume it was to make. If you like MCR, you will almost certainly enjoy this record, and even if you haven't in the past, you might still find yourself nodding your head to quite a few of the songs.\n", "val": 0.01777913235127926}
{"text": "My Chemical Romance have been gone for nearly two years. It's been 4 years since they're last album, and Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys is a huge change from previous albums such as The Black Parade and Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. The band's previous three albums were dark and edgy. Danger Days is bright, colorful, and in-your-face-obnoxious. However, it doesn't lose the charm that is My Chemical Romance.The album, while not exactly a concept album, fits into a world of California in 2019. It's after the apocalypse, and everything is controlled by the bland Better Living Industries. The Killjoys are there to bring art back into the world with color and ray guns. It's hard to keep MCR from telling a story, now isn't it?As for the songs, they aren't what you would expect. They do not sound like the band's previous three albums. However, that's a good sign. Had the band written copy-cat songs, they wouldn't have grown. They would be stuck on what made them popular rather than taking a risk in order to make something they enjoyed.Each song exists in its own little world. From the obnoxious \"Na Na Na\" to the more mellow \"S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W\" each song is different. Gerard Way's voice does not fail to entertain, and his lyrics are sharp and biting, even in the slowest song on the record. Even the last song, \"Vampire Money\" takes a stab at the vampire culture that has dominated today's world. The music itself is clean, tight, and exciting, with intense guitar solos and driving drum beats.This is a record that will divide the fan-base. Those that were attracted to the dark themes will be disappointed, unless they can focus on the metaphors of the album. There is an appreciation for this record as the band has grown as artists.As for the pop aspect of the album, many will claim that they went mainstream by using what is popular today. What Danger Days actually did was take what is popular and made it dangerous.\n", "val": 0.01435798965394497}
{"text": "When I originally heard \"Na Na Na\", I was afraid that this album would be their downfall. The song grew on me over time and now it is one of my favorite tracks. Then \"Sing\" came out and it was the same reaction again...\"uh oh.\" I didn't know what to expect when I bought this, but I decided to give them chance since I do love the past three albums. I am very happy to say that this record is amazing. Danger Days may not be as strong as their previous album, but it could just be that I haven't listened to it long enough for it to be up there. Still, I really do recommend this album to all of the MCR fans. This is one of the best albums of the year. It didn't let me down like others have this year.\n", "val": 0.04789863899350166}

{"text": "My Chemical Romance (MCR) is definitely my favorite current (still together and making albums) band.  While not a long time follower I checked them out after hearing Welcome to the Black Parade on the radio in a diner while on vacation.  I liked the song so much I remembered some of the lyrics to look it up when I got home.  Needless to say I love The Black Parade and Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.  I do like a few songs off of their first LP, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, but it wouldn't have hooked me like their other two albums.Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys is MCR's first album in four years and has been highly anticipated by fans.  I can honestly say I like the direction that they're headed here with a lighter tone than the past three albums.  Those are excellent albums and I still love listening to them but I'm really glad they've changed things up some.  I'll go through the track listing and give my personal opinion of each track.  Note that I'm no critic and these are just my own feelings on each of the songs.  Tracks 1, 7 and 14 are Dr. Death Defying talking so no ratings for those.Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na) - 3/5 stars.  The first single and the song that most of us heard first as well.  It's a pretty straight forward rocker with a chorus that just begs to be sung along with.  I wasn't crazy about it at first but it's grown on me a little.Bulletproof Heart - 5/5 stars.  A superb track that I loved the first time I heard it.  I wouldn't call it a power ballad but it's not far off.  Carries a fantastic chorus that really showcases Gerard Way's voice.Sing - 4/5 stars.  Another song I that has grown on me since my first listen.  A slower tune that's different from anything else I've heard before from MCR.  I love the strong bass line along with Way's soaring vocals during the chorus's.  Some critics have made comparisons to Aerosmith's \"Dream On\" but I don't see it.Planetary (GO!) - 3/5 stars.  Way had gone on record saying that he wanted this song to get people to dance and I think he'll have no problem accomplishing that.  Definitely makes you want to jump up and down.The Only Hope For Me Is You - 5/5 stars.  Like Bulletproof Heart I loved this one the first time I heard it as well.  The slow and beautiful intro reminded me a little of The Beatles \"Across the Universe\" till it blasts into a hard hitting techno beat and then to a [...]rocker during the chorus.Party Poison - 2/5 stars.  Pretty straight forward punk rocker.  No soaring vocals or catchy chorus's here.  Not one of my favorites.Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back - 5/5 stars.  My favorite on the album.  This totally awesome song reminds me of a classic 80's arena rocker with a chorus as incredible as Famous Last Words from their last album.S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W - 4/5 stars.  Influences from Led Zeppelin and Sgt Pepper era Beatles are certainly present here.  Gerard's voice is distored in an almost dreamlike way.  Very psychedelic indeed.Summertime - 4/5 stars.  The Cure's influence can definitely be heard on this beautiful ballad.  The instumental solo is wonderfully uplifting.  The first time I heard I couldn't believe MCR had wrote this.  You could just pluck this beauty out a Billboard list from the 80's.DESTROYA - 4/5 stars.  An incredible drum beat punctuates this song.  Much faster with a Beastie Boy meets Rage Against The Machine sound.  While driving I just want to pound on my steering wheel to the beat of this tune.The Kids From Yesterday - 4/5 stars.  I feel a little U2 in this one.  Another slower song that makes me just want to sing along.  And you gotta love that cowbell!Vampire Money - 2/5 stars.  I've heard a lot of people who have voiced their love for this one but I just couldn't get into it.  Like Party Poison this one's feels like a punk rocker as well.Well, that's the album and my feelings on it.  I have heard the two B-Sides, We Don't Need Another Song About California and Zero Percent, that were released around this album.  I really like We Don't Need Another Song About California and felt that it should have been included on the album.  Zero Percent wasn't bad either but can see why it was cut.  Definitely felt like a throwback to their earlier stuff.I said in my title that variety was what made The Beatles so great and I feel that MCR has pulled off something that many bands try and don't succeed at.  It's hard to write outside of your niche and be successful at it.  While many may argue that MCR hasn't done anything new please remember that The Beatles had also been influenced by other music when writing many of the songs that have been embedded into our brains.\n", "val": 0.018130192533135414}

{"text": "Now, before considering buying this, this album is fairly drastically different from the three other albums that My Chemical Romance has produced. This album has less of a 'Rock' sound as such and more of a Pop-Punk sound (Pretty similar to some recent Panic! At The Disco stuff). A lot of hate has been directed to this album because it is so different from MCR's classic sound.I am a fan of Pop-Punk music - hence the fact that I am also a Panic! fan - and this album, despite being very different, is a perfectly decent listen, I think. Tracks such as 'Save Yourself...', 'The Only Hope For Me...' and 'The Kids From Yesterday' are personal favourites, along with 'SING', 'Party Poison' and 'Destroya'.There are a few tracks on the album that I'm not too keen on (S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W and Vampire Money - even though the intro is hilarious) but overall it's a perfectly decent album and I think it has received a bit too much criticism.\n", "val": 0.007059887051582336}

{"text": "I own this album in both the CD and vinyl format. The photos that make up the lyric book in the CD are also what make up the inside artwork for the vinyl. The lyrics are also included on the vinyl insert. The vinyl itself is a standard black 180 gram pressing, and the label has the spider logo, which is a cool addition. Since this is a single vinyl LP I thought that it was a bit strange for it to come in a gatefold jacket, but it's great that it allows you to have the beautiful photographs as part of the album artwork. When you hear this album, it doesn't seem like it would translate well onto vinyl, but I can assure you that it sounds absolutely amazing, you can really hear all of the incredible layers of sound in all of the songs.Musically, I don't think that this album will ever compare to Three Cheers or The Black Parade, but this album was never meant to live up to those albums, it was made to stand on its own. Once you separate Danger Days from MCR's earlier albums, you can appreciate it for how incredible it truly is. This album is a masterpiece in its own right, each song is well crafted and they all work together to create a story for the listener.  The singles from this album (Na Na Na, Sing, and Planetary) are all amazing songs, but the other tracks are all equally incredible. My personal favorites are S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W, Save Yourself I'll Hold Them Back, Destroya, and The Only Hope For Me Is You.  Destroya and Save Yourself are both high energy songs that carry a very strong beat. S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W is my absolute favorite track on this album, it is so different from any other song the band has done, and it is very emotional. If you listen to its lyrics, you can really hear the emotion that was invested into it. Overall, this album is absolutely incredible even though it was a huge step in a different direction for the band. Listen to this album straight through, including the spoken tracks, before you make your judgement on this album. This album is absolutely incredible, and I think that it is a great representation of the talent in My Chem. Definitely check this album out!\n", "val": 0.03899931535124779}

So I also listen to them.That's a bonus, albeit one that some might say rests in a gray area, but oh well, I did purchase these... so I will let you decide on that.Music wise, I am not a big fan. I have yet to sit down like I used to and get comfy with the lyrics and listen to the whole album over and over, but from what I have heard... the hits are okay. I guess I may or may not get time in the future to give each album a fair day in the judgement seat, but who knows.If I were to rate the album star wise. It would be a three. Meaning average to me. Nothing special, but nothing especially bad. Of course that might change once I give the lyrics a good running through. You may see that edit in the future. LOLUntil then...

{"text": "I'm one of those that really did not give MCR a chance because they were emo or punk or I don't know; I was just judging I admit. Then out of the blue, when this album came out, I just happened to turn to MTV2 and saw the music video for Na Na Na, and it literally blue me away. Not just the song, but the visual style of the music video.And then Sing is an even better song and a better music video.But, here's the thing. It's a Post-Apocalyptic concept album--the same with Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns. And they both came out around the same time. It was like when The Prestige and The Illusionist were in theaters. Most people saw The Prestige (A Thousand Suns--and with very mixed results, but I loved it), and not enough people saw the Illusionist (MCR TTLOTFK). It's a shame too many people were fussing about how they hate Linkin Park's experimental career instead of giving MCR a chance. In other words, ATS sort of cast a shadow over MCR since they both had similiar albums and ATS was a little bit more contraversial.I have listened to Black Parade; it's been in my CD for a while back a year ago. And I can truthfully saw that this album is better (and I have no reason to be bias toward one or the other, but I can say that Linkin Park's ATS may have helped me like this album more).If you liked this album, you would probably like Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns, and vice versa.\n", "val": 7.491231372114271e-05}
{"text": "For the casual fans: this CD has plenty of love songs (who doesn't love a good love song?), much more than any other rock band I know of.  Bulletproof Heart and Summertime are a song to a significant other, saying you can run away with them, all you have to do is ask. The Only Hope For Me is You is a love song to a friend after witnessing a tragic event. \"Where were you when all of the embers fell? I still remember there covered in ash, covered in glass, covered in all my friends. I still think of the bombs they built.\" Doesn't that sound like 9/11 to you? It's saying, no matter what happens, I'm here for you. Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back is a love letter to the fans. \"Get off the ledge and drop the knife. Not a victim of a victim's life.\" They care about us, and to show it they wrote us this anti-suicide song.For the die-hard MCR fans: yes it's different. But it isn't as different as everyone says it is. Na Na Na and Vampire Money are both reminiscent of tracks like Headfirst for Halos, Dead!, House of Wolves, and Teenagers, with their bouncy vibe and obnoxious lyrics. Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back is very much like Thank You For the Venom and Famous Last Words, which was in my opinion, the best song they've ever written. Summertime is like Disenchanted, I Don't Love You and The Ghost of You. Party Poison is like The Sharpest Lives and This Is How I Disappear. The Only Hope For Me Is You and Bulletproof Heart, my favorite song off the album, are just like Helena or To the End.Regardless of similarities between this album and their past works, I believe this is a stellar work and good as a stand-alone album, or compared to the others.\n", "val": 0.004160819575190544}

{"text": "Danger Days is a concept album:  it throws us into the badlands of a post-apocalyptic wasteland right from the start.  While there are stand-alone songs, the whole of Danger Days weaves the Mad Max concepts in & out.  Between tracks we get a DJ host named \"Dr. Death\".  Dr. Death's tongue-in-cheek news, weather & traffic reports are reminiscent of Fallout 3's \"ThreeDog\" and Iggy Pop's \"Angry Bob\" (from the cyberpunk film \"Hardware\").If there's one thing different here for My Chemical Romance it's the addition of keyboards--\"Sing\" and \"Planetary (GO!)\" are good examples of how a song can still be high-energy and original even with a synth background.  The songs that stand out as 'hit' material are more accessible than their earlier work: while The Black Parade was a bit more appealing for existing MCR fans,  you could easily hear \"Bulletproof Heart\", \"Gravity\", and \"Planetary (GO!)\" on the radio and that wouldn't be a bad thing.  Ballads like \"S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W\" and the shout-punk \"Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)\" are pure pop guilty pleasure.I thought Danger Days would just be a fun album to listen to from time to time; instead I've been pleasantly surprised at the enjoyable sounds they're broadcasting for us in Danger Days, from their own vision of a blasted land.\n", "val": 0.009578467346727848}

{"text": "I've heard people make the argument that MCR's previous albums all embrace different styles.  Why, then, should fans dislike a new album which similarly embraces a new style?The ocean between Danger Days dwarfs the creek between Three Cheers and Black Parade.  Danger Days feels generic.  Gone is the edgy atmosphere that permeated both albums.  Instead, we get ballads, punk, and arena rock.  In fact, Danger Days reminds me of what happened to Linkin Park (regardless of what you think of them).  They forgot about the signature style that brought them to prominence and have subsequently lost any relevance.  The comparison is even more apt because both bands are known for emo-ish lyrics and a younger fanbase dealing with issues like break-ups,suicide, or both at once.  Music critics love to lampoon this sub-genre- perhaps both bands felt pressure and desire to step into more respectable musical climates.  Well, fine, sing about ponies if you want to, but don't abandon your amazing sound!That's not to say all of the cuts are bad.  Na Na Na, Bulletproof Heart, and The Only Hope for Me Is You all feel like MCR- especially the former.  And the rest are ok- they might be good tracks on a more boring band's album.  U2 maybe?  But not for MCR.  What's worse, most of the tracks don't showcase Gerard Way's unique vocals.  His intonation is the lifeblood of the band, and the production of the album largely obscures it.I know the album has largely been a success, but here's hoping MCR returns to more familiar territory in the future.\n", "val": 3.01795171253616e-05}

This isn't just the best thing MCR has done ever, it may be the best album I've heard all year (or at least it's in the top 5).There isn't any part of Danger Days that drags. It's fast-paced, it's fun, it's sometimes extremely touching. It has a concept that it sticks to throughout, but all of the songs could also make sense out of context. It's the kind of CD that you could listen to over and over and not be bored.Danger Days shows a lot of musical talent, a great understanding of showmanship, even if it's just through speakers, songwriting ability, and fantastic focus on detail. It doesn't just tell a story, it creates its own world. It's sort of like they took everything they've ever tried to accomplish on an album and turned it up to 11. I, for one, am so impressed and thrilled that it exists.I was planning on listing highlights of the album, but now I'm having trouble picking just a few. I'll give it a try though.

They're fun and up beat and the lyrics are still MCR. It's still all about death and destruction, but with just more of a lighter tone to it, making it in my opinion ironic.

I can tell by just listening to the music and the lyrics that they had a great time making this album and I think that's what it was all about.

But on the other hand, I've never found their obsession with \"death as a metaphor for well, everything\" to be all that interesting when stretched out to full album- and career-length. It just gets... exhausting.Which is exactly why Danger Days is such an amazing surprise. It takes all of MCR's greatest strengths - their melodic intensity, blistering vocals, and wide dramatic sweep - and removes the self-pity; replacing it almost wholesale with a sense of excitement and pure headlong ambition. Also, cyberpunk.What?Yes. As in, \"motorcycles and bionic arms\" cyberpunk. As in, less Edward Gorey, and way more&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Akira/dp/B001LMU182/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Akira.</a>&nbsp;Also way more synthesizers, pirate radio DJs, laser beams, and a veritable headrush of unexpected pop influences ranging from here to Black Eyed Peas.It should be completely ridiculous. And it kind of is. But it's ridiculous in the good way-- the \"I can't believe they went this far\" way-- and, ironically, by not taking itself so seriously, it ends up being in many ways a more impactful experience than their previous records; by turns epic, exhilarating, romantic, and wistful. (As opposed to sad, extra-sad, cancer, and dead.) It's a crazier world, sure-- but a far more vivid one. An exciting one. One you didn't expect.Apparently My Chemical Romance got bored of being their own stereotype.PROS:-Good, deep production - loud, and catchy, but with quieter layers of synth, effects, and vocal harmonies to reward multiple listens-Evocative lyrics that toe the line between drama, irony, and humor with an unexpected self-awareness-Stylistic experimentation across a wide range of influences that is both bold and more than a little crazy-Suggests an intriguing action-cyberpunk-ish premise without being trite, confusing, or pretentious-Is awesomeCONS:-Less personal and confessional in tone (which is probably more of a \"pro\" but still bears mentioning)-Might inspire you to write really long reviews about how cool it is, wasting valuable time that could be spent listening to \"Destroya\" over and over and over again-The end of \"Goodnite Dr. Death\" is painfully, obnoxiously loud and it could probably break something if you aren't careful, so consider yourself warned about thatVERDICT:It's fresh, it's funny, it's angry, and it's loud.

My Chem, has created an incredibly solid record, which, while not as groundbreaking as Black Parade was, Is an incredibly rewarding listen.  The Standard MCR Soaring vocals,and punk/arena rock tinge still shines through, on tracks \"Bulletproof Heart\" and \"The Only Hope for You is Me\".  They even Experimented with some dance punk on \"Planetary (GO!)\" and while not ground breaking, will still have you bobbing your head and singing along.  Where Danger Day's really shines is on songs such as \"Sing\" which will no doubt saturate the radio, soon enough, and the incredibly catchy \"Save Yourself, I'll hold  them back\", one of the five songs on this record to survive when the band wasn't happy with the record they were making. The other high points are the kinetic, break neck, in your face neo-punk that are \"Party Poison\" \"Na Na Na\" and without a doubt \"Vampire Money\".  Bottom line, If you don't like this album, its simply because it isn't \"Three Cheers Part 2\" or \"The Continuing March of The Black Parade.\"  Give the band a break, and hell give them kudos, for making something worthwhile, when so many other bands are already copying the albums the MCR put out before this.\n", "val": 0.020847443491220474}

What have they become? As much as it kills me to say it, My Chemical Romance SOLD OUT which is the worst possible thing any truly great band can do. The My Chemical Romance I know and loved would never have let something like this leave their studio. I waited FOUR YEARS for this album. I don't know if I've ever been more disappointed in my entire life. Every true MCR fan knows exactly what I'm talking about. This album is for 14-year-old girls.I know it sounds really harsh. But the truth is that My Chemical Romance is dead.\n", "val": 6.163952639326453e-05}

There are at least two and possibly four or five tracks that could be commercial hits, though I doubt the band was focused on making hit songs. I have played this album straight through several times. I think that is the best and perhaps only way to fully appreciate it as the work of art it truly is.

I didn't think they would top The Black Parade, yet I also didn't think they would \"de-volve\" this badly, especially given the long 4 year wait.

This album has some punk, some techno, some NIN sounding stuff, some 80s stuff but they handle it all with great skill.  There are still the MCR transitions and quirkiness.

These songs are catchy and well written. This album does have a more dance-y/synth sound to it, which I thought an emo/punk/alt/pop band like MCR would be crazy to try to do. But they actually pull it off without sounding corny or too 'pop.' The songs are well crafted with catchy melodies. The stand out songs for me are Bulletproof Heart, Save Yourself I'll hold them back, The only Hope For me is you, Sing). Planetary (Go) is the most non-MCR type song on here. Its a dance type song, something that I wouldn't be surprised to hear in a dance club. But overall its a good catchy song. One song (Summertime) is a really bland radio-friendly song. It's not bad but it's not up there with the rest of the songs. Overall, this album is worth buying. It is probably MCR's best so far.\n", "val": 0.03122473694384098}
{"text": "This album as a whole is garbage, even with a few good songs.  Someone needs to tell MCR that they aren't Queen, they aren't Bowie, they aren't Aerosmith, they certainly aren't Angels and Airwaves crap that is 'Summertime', fans don't want an \"all-star\" album of their favorite influences or a producer's vision of what a good selling album sounds like in 2010.  A fan of MCR wants an MCR album.  Go ahead and listen to Three Cheers and tell me who it sounds like.  Sounds like f'in nothing.  That's why it's brilliant.  Black Parade?  Well, they got some songs that are derivations, but they pulled them off very well, so that's ok in my book.  This album?  The first time I heard it, I felt like I heard it before.  It's like bands have nothing left after 3 albums so they make these cheesy 'influence' albums.  Also, gotta love that 'Sing' and 'Na Na Na' have already been used in NFL, American Idol and Rhapsody commercials.  Maybe that tells you all you need to know.  This reminds me more and more of Muse.  A totally, completely original band that seems to have run out of inspiration and can only make songs that sound like Queen or Audioslave or System of a Down.  Plus they advertise for everything now too.  But this isn't a review of Muse. So I'll stop there.Anyway, I guess I should state that I understand why MCR made this record.  After touring for so long with the Black Parade, they deserve to have a good time and make songs that are happy and cheesy and dancy, I guess.  It just doesn't make for an enjoyable album for me.  They didn't push themselves at all to put this out.I would like to point out that I feel the writing is actually pretty good.  So I'll give Way credit for that.  I always had the feeling that Frank was the truly musical one in the group, so I'd have to blame him for letting the producer take us through some of the crap and synth that are in these songs.  Lastly, I blame the whole band for thinking they could get away on making a whole album without a true drummer.  They popped in different drummers for different songs and you hear some of the lamest, straightest drumming with no emotion, no creativity.  And don't get me started on the DJ thing.  I mean, really? Really? A DJ spouting off nonsense?  That's how you want continuity in an album?Finally, I just want to point out that I'm not asking for MCR to put out another Black Parade or another Three Cheers or another Bullets.  I understand wanting to go in a different direction, but it's like they hardly tried here.  Maybe the band Brand New has actually ruined everything for me by creating 4 completely different albums that all sound like Brand New (listen to Seventy Times 7 (2000), Degausser (2005), Sink (2008) - same structure with dynamics and putting the 'hook' in the bridge, but oh so different sounding).\n", "val": 8.720656478544697e-05}

{"text": "My Chemical Romance goes the Sgt Pepper's route on \"Danger Days,\" where they record an album in the guise of another band. In MCR's case, it's \"The Fabulous Killjoys,\" set in some sort of future where these rockers are rebels trying to save the world from...well...something. Not that it matters, as Gerard Way paints a great big, noisy picture of a comic book world where Glam Rock rules, Queen is King and David Bowie is a major prophet.Nowhere is that truer than \"Danger Day's\" initial single, \"Na Na Na.\" Built entirely around the hook, it just plunges into amphetamine hyper-speed and doesn't let up. There's no way to avoid just how catchy the darn thing is; it's like Bowie's \"Jean Genie\" switched from 45 to 78 RPM. There's plenty of heroic chants (\"Sing,\" \"Planetary\"), anthems for saving the girl (\"The Only Hope for Me Is You,\" \"The Kids From Yesterday\") and soaring choruses all over the place. The story - as it is - gets tied together with vignettes by DJ Dr Deathray in pure comic-book fashion.While the concept doesn't really gel, the music is still super. There isn't anything as Queenly regal as \"The Black Parade's\" title song, but then, nothing on that album compared to \"Stone Cold Crazy\" like \"Na Na Na\" does. Way still has a way with a phrase, and little couplets like \"I've got a bullet-proof heart, you've got a hollow-point smile\" pierce out from the music. Also, this album starts to poke into U2 territory with \"Sing\" and \"The Kids From Yesterday\"; that's never a bad place to look for inspiration. \"Danger Days\" shows that My Chemical Romance aren't afraid to tweak the formula that's made them stars.\n", "val": 0.00038704436155967414}

But they polarized a lot of fans with The Black Parade. It was different, and a huge career risk. What did i think of it? loved it. Four years later, i finally get to hear a new MCR album, and just like 21st Century Breakdown, high expectations ruined this album. I don't think its bad, but it's far from the bands best effort. It's painfully overproduced, filled with power ballads and...um.. a dance song or two, this is a \"safe rock album\". It's not all duds though, \"DESTROYA\", \"Bulletproof Heart\", and closer \"Vampire Money\" still have the urgency the band once had, while other songs sound like 30SecondsToMars/Angels and Airwaves mashups. Remember the song \"When Worlds Collide\" by Powerman 5000? well \"Planetary (GO!)\" sounds like Panic At The Disco covering that song. I hated this at first but i've given it a chance and it did sort of grow on me, You just got to accept it for what it is.

Their love of horror movies and comic books shined through their music and lyrics and became one of the many things that made me love them even more.Their second album (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Three-Cheers-for-Sweet-Revenge/dp/B00025ETIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</a>) brought them to light in the mainstream and gave them a broader fanbase. It added a new sound but kept their horror comic attitude that they've become known and loved for. By this time I had seen them live twice and had almost religious experiences at their shows. I had learned that they not only rocked beautifully live but were super sweet guys from New Jersey.Their third release (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Black-Parade/dp/B000I5Y8ZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Black Parade</a>) took them into mega stardom and became the anthem for many My Chem fans new and old. It had music that delved deeper into their dark humor and had a theme that only matched the ferocity of their live show of the same name (which kicked all kinds of @$$! and is the best live show I've seen to date, they even had Muse as their opening act, how much better could it get?).Now, I am 23 and they release their forth album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys! I couldn't be happier. I couldn't be more proud to wear one of my many My Chem shirts or hoodies and say, that's my band! They have a way of evolving with each album's concept, changing into a new band but never leaving the true grit of who they are behind. This album makes me want to rock out, dance, and gets me to really feel the intention of the music and lyrics of the amazing guys I've come to call my music muses. Thank you boys, for never letting me down. Thank you for helping through 7 years of my life when I needed it the most. Thank you Party Poison, Jet Star, Fun Ghoul (as a fellow Italian I appreciate the double humor of that name) and the awesome Kobra Kid. Long live the MCRMY!

{"text": "Once again My Chemical Romance release a beautiful work of art. It's original it's catchy, and most of all it makes you want to rock out and dance. I have been a fan of everything My Chemical Romance has ever released. Never once have I been dissapointed by them. Up until now I had thought that Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge was the best, followed by I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love, and then The Black Parade. However, my opinion drastically changed after the first listen to Danger Days. This album is their greatest and most inspiring work of art they have dished out. I realise some people will try to put the album down with crap excuses such as \"MCR are sell outs now\" But honestly face the fact, My Chemical Romance have never been sell outs, they aren't doing it for the money, it's all for the sake of rock and expression. I have long admired the band members and their ways of thinking. But anyways, This album is nothing like their previous records. But then again, none of their albums are the same. This album takes a new approach to rock for the band, and they not only grasps the elements infused with the record but they run with them and make it their own. The concept is beautiful and creative, leaving fans in a world created by music; a world that is believable and so close that you can close your eyes and fall into it. The lyrics are amazing and while following the same signature style of the band, they stick out from previous songs. Each song is an adventure for listeners. Not one song is the same as the next and yet they all seem to fit into the concept and album very well. Synths and electronic elements add to the beauty of the guitar and bass blend. Ray Toro's voice almost feels like it is part of Gerard's and the harmony created between the two voices sends shivers down your spine during many songs. Unforgettable tunes are heard through the entire album and there are many beautiful guitar solos that will shock and awe you. Words can't really accurately describe the beauty of this album.

You may not like it or it might not be what you expected. But, really? Why would you be satisfied with exactly what you expected? This album isn't perfect but it is passionate. It is art. As soon as it begins, you are transported into the band's imagination. You can't help but wish this album were a movie, a graphic novel, anything to make it bigger and to tell you the whole story. It leaves you wanting more in the greatest way possible. It leaves you wanting to insanely scream the lyrics out of your car window. If you don't buy the album, at least download \"Sing\". For best enjoyment, listen to it at max volume. Killjoys, make some noise!\n", "val": 0.026218263432383537}
{"text": "The music industry has been so filled with manufactured pop, miserable post-grunge tripe and talentless hip-hop that trades raw emotion for slick commercialism that this excellent hard-rockin' trip came as a welcome relief. What is even more shocking is that it is made by a band that I am not too crazy about it, a band in which I felt made a couple of good songs and numerous filler. Sometimes, being proven wrong on rather this band is worth anything is a good thing and, in the case of DANGER DAYS, it is a pleasure.BLACK PARADE showed MCR's aspirations of crossing Queen, Iron Maiden, Black Flag and Pink Floyd. Here, MCR replaces Gothic rock with metallic power pop and techno-infused rock n' roll that recalls Cheap Trick, the Jam, the Stooges, the Sex Pistols, Depeche Mode, Happy Mondays, Jane's Addiction, the Buzzcocks and numerous anti-Reagan punk rock bands. Not only do MCR sound different; they have also changed their image as comic-book heroes and sci-fi geeks, a strong contrast to the black-and-white look of their early albums.But this change of image isn't just a gimmick; it is an effective way to help MCR liberate their music and do whatever they want with their songs. BLACK PARADE, for all its virtues, felt conservative, as if MCR were restrained by their image as members of the black parade. DANGER DAYS, on the other hand, sounds looser, less restraining and more vibrant. As a result, they have crafted an album that is enjoyable and at same time yields many rewards upon numerous listens.There are an overabundance of irresistible hooks, riffs, guitar solos and melodies that make this album worth a trip and there are number of terrific songs that rival the best of Green Day, Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam. These songs include the annoyingly catchy \"Na Na Na Na Na Na...\", the disco-flavored tonic \"Planetary\", the dizzying cascade of \"Sing\" and the pummeling rockers \"Party Poison\", \"Destroya\" and \"Vampire Money\". There is a sweet, Beatlesque pop tune \"Summertime\" and a stab at Achtung Baby-era U2 in \"The Kids from Yesterday\", which sounds like a cross between \"Discotheque\", \"Ultra Violet (Light My Way)\" and \"Stay (Faraway, So Close)\". Each of these songs sound distinctive and different yet are endlessly melodic and get better upon each listen.The general theme of the album calls for a revolution against the corporate \"pigs\" that are demoralizing the music industry. It is a breath of fresh air that we have an album whose sentiments and music are actually genuine. MCR has successfully distant themselves from the talentless, grotesquely overvalued post-grunge rock bands who prize sales charts over an encompassing ambition. DANGER DAYS is a terrific rock record and an injection of adrenaline for anyone sickened by today's redundant pop and rock music. It is not only one of the year's grandest albums; it is an album cements MCR as one of the most exciting and interesting rock bands in recent memory.Finally, a rock band with talent and ambition! Where do you see those these days?\n", "val": 0.01047935988754034}

{"text": "And I honestly can't see why anybody would be. So, I've been with this band since its early Three Cheers days, and when The Black Parade was released, do you know how many reviews I saw that said it was horrible? A LOT. More than a lot. And yet here are people saying this is a cheap imitation of some Jonas Brothers pop band and TBP was TRUE rock, but what I don't understand is... how do you not hear strokes of songs from TBP on Danger Days? Besides that, truly, a band that knows how to reinvent itself like My Chemical Romance has time and time again is a band that's going to survive the test of time, and the fans need to accept this. Danger Days is an amazing album. FREAKING AMAZING. It has not left any of my various CD players since I first purchased it, and I smile like crazy when I'm listening to it.I fully admit that I am a fan of most genres of music, so maybe that's why I'm able to embrace their \"pop\" sound on this album. I also can't say this is the first time I've heard a sound like what's on Danger Days because I honestly don't listen to older rock -- for all I know, MCR was inspired by older bands on it. But to me, this album is completely refreshing to listen to and I personally don't think it's like anything out there today, \"Jonas Brothers bands\" and all. Perhaps because this year has been total crap for me and I love this band SO MUCH... that's the reason why I'm happy this album is here. I think I needed it -- it couldn't have been more perfect timing. And it's also the reason why I'm so ecstatic for the fun sound My Chem has instilled into Danger Days. It's \"no-regrets, dance until you drop, balls-out, air-guitar-around-your-house-in-your-underwear\" type of music, and I for one applaud them for making it so. With all the crap that's been going on in the world -- the economy, the job loss, etc. -- this album is like a lightning bolt of energy. IT'S HAPPY. And I need happy right now. Not depressing (although, I would never call MCR depressing, anyway).It's disheartening to hear when fans of an artist's work can't or won't embrace them when they try something new. If you've only listened to this album once, I implore you to give it another go-around before you decide to toss it in your trash. I'm copying and pasting what I said in my last review for TBP here because it still remains true for me to this day: \"The band is growing. I happen to like Three Cheers and Bullets equally. I don't think MCR would want to sound the same time after time after time... To me, an album is an expression of where you are in life at that particular moment. The lyrics and music SHOULD reflect this, and it shouldn't matter if it's creating a different sound or not. MCR's music is just about as much for them as it is for their fans, if not more. We should remember this as fans of their music and not write them off as complete has-beens because they've been featured on MTV one too many times. Just because they have a new sound DOES NOT mean they've sold out.\"Now for the songs themselves? I am sincerely in love with every single song on this album. It's like an orgasmic mix of trans-am 80s hair music, punk, psychedelic electronic, and dance music. And considering the persona each band member has created for themselves (Party Poison, Fun Ghoul, Jet Star, and Kobra Kid), the music fits PERFECTLY. \"Destroya\" is the one that stands out to me the most in excellence, but I can't say it's the only song on there that is my absolute favorite. The best thing about MCR is their ability to create albums that have songs on them that I can switch back and forth on my favorites. Tomorrow, \"Bulletproof Heart\" might be my favorite because they're all my favorites. When I first saw the music video for \"Na Na Na,\" I felt like this album was going to be a comic book adventure in music form, and I'm elated to say this holds true. I will continue to take anything MCR throws at me, and praise their name to anyone who has never heard this awesome band's music.Killjoys, make some noise!

I feel they changed and not sold out but refined their sounds.This Album feels like a complete take over from the pop music industry to cash in for some teenage jock culture. The exact opposite that My Chemical Romance was sent to do. I wasn't too emo in high school or anything but appreciated the genre. This is the exact opposite of the genre. Kind of like when Metallica turn from heavy metal to a midlife crisis alternative band but worse. I feel I sinned against rock music by contributing to the purchase of this album. I hope others will follow suite and give this album the rating it deserves. This album may gain much success cause it is catering to the high school pop girl culture which is big money but I hope it does not get one cent from those who really enjoyed the roots of the band and love heavy rock music.

I know people have complained about how this CD isn't original \"My Chemical Romance,\" but honestly, how many bands do you know of that thrived on making nothing but the same thing over and over? \"Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys\" exceeds every expectation I had before I heard it. The dramatic turn this band made with this album really kicks their career up a notch! While I LOVED the raw feel of \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\", the thick, palpable dark rock of \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\", and the rock opera-esque, glam rock feel of \"The Black Parade\", \"Danger Days\" allows My Chemical Romance's ability to mix things up to REALLY shine. This album will keep you moving!Overall, I feel this album is My Chemical Romance's most artistic. I remember reading somewhere that \"Danger Days\" has been considered a love song to rock 'n roll...and it's so true. Homage is paid in almost every single way possible.From Dr. Death-Defying's narration, the midway point rock party of \"Party Poison,\" all the way to the haunting static following The Star-Spangled Banner, \"Danger Days\" is truly a masterpiece.

{"text": "My Chemical Romance. Dark, \"emo\", depressing, angry. This is what the mainstream viewed this band as for years with the releases of their albums Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and The Black Parade. However, with Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, I would be shocked and surprised if any one of these words was now used to desribe what this band has reinvented itself to be.Danger Days is a departure from everything that The Black Parade made itself out to be. It embraces the rough-edged punk rock defiance of the 70's like The Sex Pistols, while channeling the anthem rock bands of the 80's that would make Freddy Mercury proud, while picking up the fantastical science fiction, gun-fighting imagery that nods towards Quentin Tarentio's Kill Bill and Alan Moore's V for Vendetta. The band does not give up the story telling qualities that made Three Cheers and The Black Parade great, depicting the technicolor tale of a group of outlaw-vigilantes called \"The Kill Joys\" that fight against the major corporation Better Living Industries and it's evil leader Korse.Although I would be concerned that the departure might deter some fans off, the artist in me loves everything about this reinvention. What is great about My Chemical Romance is that they continuously recreate what the band represents, and they have never disappointed. I must be honest, I was a bit hesitant on first listen, but the ablum was easy to warm up to. I encourage any listener, new fan or old, to give it at least a run through or two before passing their judgement.In a music industry that is laden today with self-indulgance and materialsim, My Chemical Romance is a breath of fresh air. Danger Days is refreshing, uplifting, and modivating to listeners. It has thrown down the gauntlet at the feet of what rock is in today's society, challenging the listeners to not take any of B.S. that the industry is trying to shove down their throats, and to make something better for themselves.\n", "val": 0.02198023907840252}

My Chemical Romance have shown that not only do they have what it takes to keep going but that they are going to pioneer a new time of catchy pop punk to drive them therer in their trans am. It started with some confusion over which song was their official pre-album release, but never-the-less, there hasn't been an eplosion of the same sort in a long time in the music scene.From the pedal-to-the-metal catchiness of Na Na Na to the epic emothions of Sing, this album has everything, and they have proven that you do not need to have a story line, or any life-changing music genres to create a fantastic album.  They have drawn their inspiration from the east coast yet given a feel of LA in the 70's, appealing to all, and have done it all by stripping bare and just making great songs. Even critics who have previously hated MCR agree that this album is fantastic, and you can tell that after 4 years of no music that an explosion of this size will only continue to grow even more...Look alive sunshin, as its coming your way and you won't be able to let it go once it does\n", "val": 0.009953634813427925}

But then I took a step back and listened to all of their previous albums again and I realized that these guys know what they are doing. I had faith in the band I had listened to for years.Four years after \"The Black Parade\", we get \"Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys\".This album is by far their best yet. It is creative, catchy and fun, but still holds true to everything they have ever stood for. They still have that amazing sound they were always known for, with a new electronic twist.The album begins with a call to arms by our post apocalyptic DJ, Dr. Death Defying that leads right into the first single off the album \"Na Na Na\". It's loud, its catchy, and will be stuck in your head for the rest of the day. It's a powerful song to open with. From then on, you are taken on a ride. You feel like you are in the Trans Am with the boys, rocking out and running from BL/ind, the evil corporation that the Killjoys are trying to defeat.Dr. Death Defying comes back two more times in the album, one to tell us about Jet Star and Kobra Kid, and again to sign off. But after ends his transmission, there is still one last song. A punk song called \"Vampire Money\" with a beginning that reminds you of \"Ballroom Blitz\". This seems as the most perfect way to end the album, with a fun song that shows that My Chemical Romance is back and here to stay.People may argue that they have changed or \"sold out\" but I don't think that at all. The boys have grown up. They are all married and some of them now even have children of their own. They are still the same band we all know and love, just doing what they want.This album is amazing and I recommend it to anyone who loves fun, good music, that has lyrical substance.If I could, I'd give it 1000 out of 10 stars.But I guess a 5 out of 5 will have to do :)\n", "val": 0.021382302045822144}
{"text": "My Chemical Romance have been in my cd player constantly over the past 6 or 7 years. The Black Parade was hands down a great album, every song great and very catchy. So my expectations and anticipation were very very high for their new album, Danger Days... And then I saw their music video of Na Na Na and was instantly hooked. So yes, the album came out today. And too my utter dismay these songs are mediocre at best. Maybe 5 out of the 15 tracks are good and wouldn't you know it, the Na Na Na song happens to be the best song on the album. I understand they wanted to diversify themselves from the usual norm that goes with their genre. But when one song reminds me of a cheap knock off of Zebrahead's music and another a wanna be Beastie Boys I get disappointed. So all in all save yourself the money and just download it for the $3.99 amazon has it right now, and don't waste the extra $5 to get the cd and artwork. 4 years.... definitely expected more....this album should have only taken 1.5-2 years to come out. Oh well, maybe in another 4 years, I can hope these guys will go back to their vampire roots and put out their usual best like the first 3 albums.\n", "val": 0.00043247482972219586}
{"text": "Was Danger Days worth waiting 4 years for? the anserw is simple yes. This is not the same My Chemical Romance from the Black Parade, no its deffinetly not them. But thats not a bad thing infact its quite the opposite. Danger Days shows how far MCR has come from being just a small band from Jersey. The best thing about this album is that there is no genere, the songs are so diverse that there is no way anyone cant find at least one song off this album that they like. I personaly cant find a song I don't like each song is beutifuly writin both lyricaly and instrumently. The production quality is out of this world its increadably crisp and crystal clear. I have really nothing bad to say about this album if i had to pick out aything it would probally the japanesse woman in party posion but the song is so amazing and her part is so short that its really not even worth writing about but i don't want you to think this is just some fanboy ranting and id be honest if this album sucked. If you didn't like MCR before you should at least listen through this cd first you may be suprised, but if you are a mcr fan this may not be the same MCR but never the less its still MCR and you should fall in love with this album as I did. I gave this album a perfect score because its diverse, well writin, its production quality is unmatched.\n", "val": 0.0005161339649930596}

This album is absolutely incredible. Danger Days is, to me, an alternate universe, or an alternate reality, if you like. This album is filled to the brink with kick ass tunes and songs that you just won't be able to stop yourself jumping around to. Not only that, but there are also quite a few ballads on here, something that's completely different to MCR's previous three albums. Actually, scrap that. Let's be honest. EVERYTHING. IS. DIFFERENT... and it's the most amazing thing they've ever done. This time around, they seem 110% ecstatic with what they're produced, and, for the first time in a long time, they're actually having a blast doing it. The amount of creativity and imagination surrounding this album is astounding, and the Killjoy world is just so... visually stunning. Trust me, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STOP LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM.

{"text": "I preordered my copy of \"Danger Days\" from Amazon, and got it on Saturday (much to my surprise and delight, actually). I've been listening to it almost nonstop since then.The album opens with Dr. Death-Defying leading us into this adventure with the amazing opening line, \"Look alive, sunshine...\" It smoothly transitions to \"Na na na,\" an energetic, exhilarating song that I love to listen to while walking to class in the morning. Dr. Death checks in on us in the middle of the album, and shows us out near the end. I love how they did this; it makes it seem like we actually are listening to him on the radio out in the Zones.I'm not a fan of slow songs, so I tend to skip out on songs like \"Bulletproof Heart\" and \"S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W\" (although I think the latter is beautiful). \"SING\" is one of my favorites: it's what the Killjoys are all about- surviving, spreading your message, and f*** `em all (or, that's how I interpreted it). I also loved \"Party Poison\" and \"Vampire Money\" because of their total punk rock feel and how fun they are (I love jumping around to them). I think my favorite, though, is \"DESTROYA.\" It's simply amazing.Some people who say this is a radical departure from the \"old MCR.\" I disagree. This is exactly what MCR is all about. It's about art, and not giving in, and being yourself. Isn't that what MCR has been promoting since day one? I guess, though, this album is very rock `n' roll, so if that isn't your thing- that isn't your thing. Still, it's fun and exciting, and you can tell that the band had an amazing time making it. It makes you want to jump up and down and sing along, and I think that is what makes it an awesome album. Buy it if you're a fan, of course, or if you want some pure rock to lift your spirits and dance to.(Also, if you're a comic book fan like me: listening to this is exactly like being in one :D)\n", "val": 0.02943500690162182}

{"text": "It's been four years since My Chemical Romance put out an album. I won't lie, I was originally a bit worried about it coming out. They'd grown up, started families and life happened. They were different people than when they first started, and it's just what they needed. As soon as Na Na Na was released, my fears were gone. Out was the dark cloud that seemed to loom over the band in the final days of The Black Parade and in came  a brand new band. A new band coming to us in color, a new band that was having fun and for the first time in years seemed to be enjoying what they were doing.Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys is an album that takes you on a fast paced ride that never lets you look back. You're running from dracs, enjoying the good times and loving the people you're with. There's a direct message in the music, tho the members of My Chemical Romance have promised that wasn't the intention. The album's lyrics and meanings are left to interpretation, however there's one thing for certain: The boys are having an amazing time.The songs are fun. Fast paced with a catchy beat that blows all the current \"rock\" music out of the water.  The lyrics are fun, to the point and a (non) message for the masses.Gone are the uniforms and the feeling of dread. They are back with action packed rock and roll that will get anyone up and off their feet. They're breakin all the rules, and the album benefits from it.The best album of 2010!\n", "val": 0.030156632885336876}

When I first heard \"We Want You\", I listened to it over and over again. The beat took me back to my Neo-Soul days, but the words to the song are so powerful.  Anytime you ask for the Holy Spirit to fill the place, you better watch out for all the power that is going to take over.  There is nothing not to love about this song.  Another one of my favorites is \"It's All For You\".  I can't get enough of that song.  I feel like I play it everytime I get in the car. The music is on point and the background really stands out. Preashea's voice is different, it's stong and of a lower register. Her voice is one of the things that drew me to the album.

The lyrics in every song speak of loving God, honoring Him and giving our whole selves to Him for His purpose. Its not a bunch of hooping and hollering and screeching. There is a message in every song. Yes she has a lower range and I love it! I start off my mornings with this album and I'm so glad I purchased it.\n", "val": 0.006967383436858654}

{"text": "I stumbled across this CD at a local electronics/music/video chain store, and looked at the back cover.  The main thing I noticed was that it was produced by Aaron Lindsey, who I know is writing partners with Isreal Houghton and has contributed production duties to a huge chunk of Isreal's solo projects and the CD's with New Breed (and other major artists).  So I bought it strictly based on what I know about Mr. Lindsey's track record - I haven't heard Preashea Hilliard's name before and hadn't heard any of the songs (although I guessed - correctly - that track 1, \"He's Able\" was a remake of the D. Haddon song sung by Darwin Hobbs).  I was not disappointed, and if you are an Isreal & New Breed fan, you can't help but love everything about this CD.It has the grooving contemporary praise songs as well as the more mellow worship songs, all with the New Breed (Aaron Lindsey) production stamp on it.  He even co-wrote 3 songs while Isreal co-wrote one of those.  But make no mistake - this is still Preashea Hilliard's show!  She wrote or co-wrote several of the songs as well.  She has a limited-range, lower-tone voice that I had to get used to at first but I loved the way she praised and worshiped everything she had out of every song!  And I loved the \"Oh How We Love You\" prayer that was included on track #8 - a great way to close out one of my favorite tracks!  She sounds to me like a very experienced praise and worship leader at her church and she uses that experience very well on this project.Again, I hadn't heard a single song from this CD on Chicago \"inspirational\" radio and never heard of Ms. Hilliard, but I know there is much more great music out there (like this CD) than what is played on the radio.  If you have the same problem with your local radio station, I suggest getting this CD TODAY and requesting one of the songs to be played to support this spirit-filled project!  This is a great CD for praisers and worshipers thanks to Ms. Hilliard's exhortation, and a great CD for musicians thanks to the spot-on band and Mr. Lindsey's production.

{"text": "Sure, Peter Noone was a safe teenybopper idol and the Hermits weren't frequently used in the studio, but what a great string of lightweight pop singles they left behind in the wake of the second wave of the British  Invasion.Granted, this stuff isn't quantum physics, but songs like  \"Im Into Something Good,\" \"Silhouettes\" and \"Mrs.  Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" were infectious ear candy for  those of us who were barely in our teens in the mid-sixties.  One of the  first six albums I bought (I now have over 6,000) was Introducing Herman's  Hermits with the three previously mentioned singles on it.  It also  contained a lot of covers like \"Sea Cruise\" and \"I  Understand,\" but this was a singles band which is what makes this such  a terrific collection.  The only singles missing are their last two to  chart in the U.S.--\"Don't Go Out  Into the Rain (You're Going To  Melt)\" and \"Museum,\" both from 1967. Instead we're given a  handful of failed singles from 1968 to their breakup in 1970, although  several of them hit the top ten in the UK: \"Sunshine Girl\" (#8),  \"Something's Happening\" (#6), \"My Sentimental Friend\"  (#2) and \"Years May Come, Years May Go\" (#7).  Since this is,  after all, a UK release it only makes sense that these songs--though  unfamiliar to the average American listener--are included in this Best Of  package.  [Note: No. 1 songs like \"Mrs. Brown\" and \"I'm  Henry VIII, I Am\" are on this set, too, even though they were never  released in the UK as singles.  So this collection seems to be a compromise  for fans on both sides of the Atlantic.]In any case, this is a wonderful  collection of sixties pop confection.

{"text": "I well recall singing \"Henry VIII\" in the playground.  It was the 1960s, and Herman's Hermits seemed to be everywhere: on the radio, on the jukebox, on home hi-fi stereos.  It was a very popular band, so much so that it was often mentioned in the same breath with The Beatles--and indeed the two bands had a fair amount in common when they first began their careers.  But where The Beatles would mutate with the passing years and grow into several unexpected directions, Herman's Hermits remained exactly what it had always been: a charming pop band with a fresh-faced and boyish-looking lead singer.  His name was Peter Noone.Truth be told, it was really Noone who made the band; although the rest of the boys certainly appeared on stage with Noone, they were seldom used to any extent in the recordings that made Herman's Hermits such an unqualified success on both sides of the Atlantic during the \"English Invasion.\"  Noone had a rather plantive voice with working-class accents and he gave his vocals a light touch, eschewing long notes, high notes, and other showy expressions--and the result was almost conversational and truly charming.Then as now, tastes in music differed between England and America, and while Herman's Hermits scored numerous hits in both countries during the 1960s they were not always the same ones.  This inexpensive compilation makes the best of worlds, presenting most of the bands hits regardless of on which side of the Atlantic they occurred.  While both American and English listeners will recognize a good chunk of the songs, each will discover ones they never knew existed.In terms of sound, the recordings date from the 1960s and they show it, but they've been brushed up quite a bit for this release and the result is a nice if not always top-notch sound. Whatever the case, it's all a lot of innocent, 1960s pop fun, and while it may not convert modern youth to the sound, those who recall the band's glory days will enjoy it greatly.GFT, Amazon Reviewer\n", "val": 0.022027259692549706}

{"text": "Among the Herman's Hermits compilations currently available (as I write this, it is still available in the UK), this is as good as any.Their American chart history was very different from their UK chart history. Some singles were released in one country but not the other and even where a single was released in both, it often did much better in one than the other. Despite having a UK number one hit with their first single, they were much more popular in America than Britain from 1964 to 1966 but the positions were reversed thereafter.The American top ten hit, Leaning on a lamp post, and two other American top forty hits (Don't go out in the rain, Museum) are not included here, though none of these made the UK charts - only Museum was actually released in the UK. Also missing is Hold on, the title track of a film they starred in. The only UK hit missing is Oh you pretty thing, a Peter Noone solo track recorded in the early seventies.Herman's Hermits began with I'm into something good (a cover of a song by Earl Jean of the Cookies), their only British number one hit, which also made the American top twenty. Six top ten American hits including two number ones were never released as UK singles, these being Can't you hear my heartbeat (a UK hit for Goldie and the gingerbreads), Mrs Brown you've got a lovely daughter, I'm Henry the eighth I am (an old music hall song), Listen people, Leaning on the lamp post (inexplicably omitted from this collection) and Dandy. Two UK singles - Show me girl, You won't be leaving - made the top twenty but were not released as singles in America.Some singles were released in both countries, these being Silhouettes (a cover of a fifties song by The Rays), Wonderful world (a song that has also charted for both Sam Cooke and Louis Armstrong at different times), Just a little bit better, A must to avoid, This door swings both ways, No milk today and East west.There's a kind of hush was a top ten hit in both charts although it was a bigger hit in America. I can take or leave your loving just missed the UK top ten and just missed the American top twenty. After that, Herman's Hermits never again made the American top forty but continued to chart in Britain.Their remaining major UK hits were Sleepy Joe, Something is happening, My sentimental friend, Years may come years may go and Lady Barbara. Here comes the star (an Australian song) and Bet your life I do (written by members of Hot Chocolate before they became famous for their own music) were lesser UK hits.Despite missing a few songs, this collection will provide enough Herman's Hermits music for most people. Some years ago, there were two CD's available in the UK titled Best of the EMI years (Volume 1 1964 - 1966, Volume 2 1967 - 1971). These are now out of print but together remain the most comprehensive collection of their music yet released on CD.\n", "val": 0.00010326025949325413}
{"text": "I bought this cd for nostalgic reasons, as I was a teenager when the British Invasion of pop stars began in the wake of the success of the Fab Four, The Beatles, on our American shore in the mid-nineteen sixties. With the advent of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, Gerry and the Pacemakers, and The Dave Clark Five, how could Herman's Hermits not fare well?Led by the fresh faced, photogenic, clean-cut and boyish Peter Noone, the band was to conquer America with their up-tempo, British music hall influenced, vaudevillian pop. They took America by storm. In listening to the album, which is a terrific, comprehensive compilation of their recordings, I realized that I had forgotten just how many hit songs they had had that I still love hearing.From their irrepressible debut single, \"I'm Into Something Good\", to their remake of the Rays' nineteen fifties hit \"Silhouettes\", to the unparalleled \"No Milk Today\", and last, but certainly not least, their 1967 hit, \"There's a Kind of a Hush All Over the World\",  Herman's Hermits were able to score significant hits. There are other hits on this album, some more well known, perhaps, but these are my favorites. With twenty five tracks from which to choose, many baby boomers will enjoy taking a walk down memory lane with this cd.\n", "val": 0.02322434075176716}

I was anxious to have their version of \"Silhouettes\", even though a closer listen now reveals a song sung by an [poor singer] (I skip over \"What a Wonderful World\" for that reason).

{"text": "Herman's Hermits were nearly as successful as The Beatles and The Stones in the sixties and also made the American breakthrough. They had a knack for hummable, melodic tunes and they featured in a movie or two that I saw as a kid (Ms Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter was one of those movie hits, the daughter in question being the puppy of a racing dog if I remember correctly!). What set them apart, was the lovely harmony vocals and the British accent; unlike most, they never affected an American or even mid-Atlantic accent in their catchy music. This excellent collection includes all of their greatest hits, taking the listener down memory lane to revisit the innocence of the 60s with glorious pop songs like I'm Into Something Good, Sleepy Joe and humorous ditties like I'm Hennery The Eighth I Am. My personal favourites include No Milk Today, There's A Kind Of Hush, My Sentimental Friend, Years May Come, Years May Go and Lady Barbara. I suppose they were considered a teenybop band and therefore weren't taken as seriously as some of their contemporaries, but time has been kind to their music - compared to a lot of today's chart stuff, this is a classic, timeless sound. This album will appeal to everyone who loves clever, tuneful pop performed with feeling and intelligence.\n", "val": 0.030166268348693848}

Fortunately for us listeners, not all of their 'hits' were as bad, in fact they ascended into pop music's stratosphere with some great numbers indeed!Even though in my own youth in the mid-60's, I didn't like \"Mrs. Brown, You've Got Lovely Daughter\" at all, I now realize my mistake. I really love listening to this one in particular whenever it graces the airwaves.\"Listen People\" was one of the better soft-rock pieces of the decade, and had genuine dramatic feeling, with great lyrics and a melody to match, and a wonderful arrangement. \"There's a Kind of Hush\" was a beautifully moody little song, which had orchestration somewhat reminiscent of stuff that was being done by/for Chad and Jeremy. And \"A Must to Avoid\" was one the best renditions of any song from P. F. Sloan's extensive songwriting oeuvre.Peter also did a palatable version of \"End of the World\" (Yes, I'm sure that Skeeter Davis did it much better).Much of the rest of their catalogue was of the bouncy little mid-tempo pop-rock variety, always pleasant and generally uplifting. \"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\" and \"Just a Little Bit Better\" were the best. (Their remakes of \"Silhouettes\", \"Sea Cruise\" and \"Wonderful World\" didn't quite match the quality of the originals, but were still nice enough to listen to.Of course, \"Henry the VIII\" was a cute little jangley number from the old British dance hall catalogue (as per another reviewer - I didn't know this).Sorry to say that these guys were probably the basis for the later debacle known as the Monkees, the difference being that Herman's Hermits songs were mostly quite good. (With only a couple of exceptions, the Monkees would have been better off playing all their tunes in some Nevada ghost town, and never recording at all).\n", "val": 0.025148382410407066}

The arrangements are very unique and enjoyable. It IS NOT typical ukulele music - Hawaiian or Polynesian, but varied styles, and all played exceptionally well. However, Amazon offers expedited shipping which IS NOT available for this product since it comes from Great Britain. I paid the expedited shipping charges, received the notice of delivery from Amazon, then received the CD 2 weeks later. I went through the normal e-mails through Amazon and the Ukulele Orchestra offered a refund or additional CD to compensate for the delay. I did neither since it was not their fault. Amazon did nothing about the charge and offered no reason for the delay. This is a great CD and worth the wait. Don't pay for expedited shipment!\n", "val": 0.010355518199503422}

The beautiful thing is that it all done on the ukelele!! No drums, electric guitars or \"electronic funk\" sound. Everything is from the natural sounds of the instruments and the voices of the artists. It is a wild delight - especially hearing \"Born to be Wild\" on the Ukelele. It's a classic for all the ages!\n", "val": 0.047754351049661636}

Blades is most commonly known in the U.S. as a screen actor, but he's best known everywhere else in the world as an incredibly mature, phenomenal, and  politically meaningful singer and songwriter. This album contains the best  performances of his 30-plus album career. There's no one else quite like  him. One warning for Blades-novice gringos: all of the songs on this album  are sung in Spanish, and for once, there are no English translations in the  accompanying material. Still, and even if you don't speak Spanish, this is  the best and most meaningful salsa music on the planet, hands down. The  melodies and and rhythms are amazingly complex. After literally hundreds of  listenings, it still moves my soul like no other music ever has. Also, at a  full 74 minutes long, you definitely get your money's worth in terms of  length. My only gripe about the CD is that two songs that are on the  cassette version (\"Patria\" and \"Claro Oscuro\"), were  omitted from the CD due to space limitations, and I would have happily paid  more for a longer two-CD set. Still, it's the finest album I've ever owned.  !Se puede!\n", "val": 0.031566768884658813}

He shaves a few inches of hair on the side of his head and it is world news.  BUT, take all that away, and the reason so many people are smitten with him is his impecable voice!  The best in the business.  Able to sing multitudinous styles and genres.  Stripped away of everything but simple backing instruments, the voice shines brilliantly.Even more impressive, these tracks were not recorded in multiple takes in a studio with the engineers using autotune to tweak the faulty pitches, and electronics to enhance the tone or depth of the voice.  No one spliced together the best bits and pieces of 24 different takes.  No producers created the voice we hear.  These tracks were recorded LIVE, in performance on the radio or at his sold out show.  It demonstrates that behind the fashion, the costumes, the make-up and the hype, this guy has years and years of technical vocal training to go along with a uniquely beautiful voice.  He has worked hard and paid his dues for many years, and we are grateful and excited that we can now enjoy THAT VOICE on our iPods daily.\n", "val": 0.022282877936959267}

{"text": "I have been to hundreds of concerts in my time and at a very few of them did I feel privileged to be in the presence of a gifted vocalist. Adam Lambert's concerts were in that rare category. And yes, I did say concerts in the plural because if you love superior vocal talent, one concert will not be enough -- you will want to experience that voice again and again. Sadly, monetary and time constraints prevent many of us from hearing this extraordinary voice live as often as we might wish.Luckily, Lambert has released this Acoustic LIve EP so we can experience his vocal gifts over and over again.The best track is Whataya Want From Me, this live recording of which is so perfect, so pristine and yet, amazingly, also so emotionally-driven, that your heart would have to be petrified not to feel the need, pathos and hope Lambert conveys. Soaked is nothing less than the vocal masterclass he taught to rapt audiences around the world --watching an audience go from shrieking insanity to appreciative silent admiration was itself a stunning example of showmanship.  Stripped of the theatrical orchestration and bombast of the album version, Lambert's voice -- surely one of the best in the world -- soars. Only when the song concludes, can the listener breathe again. Lambert co-wrote Aftermath; the rock treatment on his original For Your Entertainment cd will now be overshadowed by the quiet conviction and hope of this far superior acoustic treatment. Mad World is, of course, Lambert's signature tune -- at least for right now -- and hopefully its inclusion here will satisfy fans upset over its exclusion on FYE.If you loved Lambert's FYE cd, you will enjoy the opportunity to hear songs re-conceived in a way that allows this amazing voice to shine and soar and grip you with its emotion. If you didn't like FYE and thought it was overproduced and hid Lambert's vocals, then this acoustic EP is the album for you. If you've never paid attention to Lambert's voice -- then start!What a lovely gift to us all in this dark season and amidst the sludge of autotuned dreck that masquerades as music today. Lambert brings us back to real music, again.\n", "val": 0.01456533744931221}

Secondly, the audience participation gives you the illusion of being there: for those of us who have no Adam Lambert concerts in our vicinity (sniff!), we get to share a fraction of the experience.But next time, RCA producers: SLEEPWALKER.

{"text": "Adam Lambert can quite simply sing his face off.  His vocals on these tracks are almost otherworldly.  He bends and twists notes with apparent ease and manages to wring emotion out of every note without seeming artifice.  I purchased this yesterday and have it stuck on repeat for the past 24 hours.  My only complaint is that he didn't include one of the many wonderful versions of \"Sleepwalker\" which I thought would be a commercial success had he released it as a single.  Personally, I would have left out \"Music Again\" which I think is better suited to the glam rock version that is on the For Your Entertainment album.  Sleepwalker, on the other hand, is better performed acoustically.  With this one caveat, I still have to give it 5 stard.  In this world of auto-tuned slickness and no-talents who manage to sell millions, it is so refreshing to hear someone who can actually sing without hidining behind special effects.  Adam's voice is a wonderful instrument with pure tone and perfect pitch.  I hope that this Ep will be immensely successful, so that he feels the need to strip down a song or two on his next album.  It is in the stripped down, emotive interpretations of songs that his glorious voice is given the chance to shine without adornment.  It is such a shame that the world is so focused on his sexual orientation, his clothing, hair, and make-up and not his talent.

I only wish his acoustic performance of Sleepwalker was on this one - check out the one in Zurich on YouTube... I guess they will put it on the next and I will keep handing over $5 and bowing down in gratitude.So if you don't have this, buy it.  If you can see Adam in concert, do it.  Don't be afraid to be transported to another planet by this stellar performer and authentic human being.  He lays it all out there in every performance and we are the lucky commoners that benefit from his gift.\n", "val": 0.040516842156648636}

{"text": "When an artist makes an acoustic album there is no way to fake whether they have talent or not. And for those who might not know, Adam Lambert HAS talent. His voice is all that's needed. There are no auto-tune or background vocals or instruments to cover it up. It's just his voice - stripped bare for all to hear. With his beautiful, inspiring, emotive voice and maybe some guitar and drums to enhance the ambiance, he grabs hold of your heart and soul and does not let go. But that's okay because you're not going to want him to let go. Put the songs on repeat and stay with Adam as long as you can because the Real World pales in comparison.\n", "val": 0.006608549505472183}

{"text": "Although it definately had it's great moments Charlie Wilson's previous solo album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Uncle-Charlie/dp/B001P4OACE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Uncle Charlie</a>&nbsp;not only suffered from too many cases of overproduction but lack of direction as well,concentrating a little too much on being musically modern than on well constructed songs and grooves. This follow up really does an excellent job at making up for that. Charlie has gone out of his way to make his solo music very distinctive and,as with everything he's done no one is going to mistake this for a Gap Band album from the early 80's. Basically this is an album consisting of midtempo jams that use a lot of modern flourishes such as slippery beats and chanted vocal choruses. But all the same there's still a lot of the unique creative flavors that defines Charlie Wilson. True his voice has weathered to a degree with age but on songs such as \"My Girl Is A Dime\",\"You Are\",\"Once And Forever\",\"I Can't Let Go\",\"Where Would I\" and \"Lotto\" both the modern spirit of music and his own musical flavors shine through at the same time,something he didn't quite get to with his previous album. It's on the uptempo songs that the improvement is even more marked. On the twinkling funk/dance of \"Never Got Enough\" and to a somewhat lesser degree \"Life Of The Party\" and the stop-n-start \"Crying For You\"  Charlie manages to make faster music that is both true to the 70's/80's disco and funk scene from which he came but is also true all the same to the somewhat more high tech revial of that music taking place in the here and now. So not only are the grooves strong and make you want to dance and enjoy yourself but it seems to lift his own spirit that he no longer feels he has to stop being true to himself musically to be successful. Sitting in the middle of that road is a faithful cover of Roger Troutman's \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" featuring Fantasia in a powerful vocal duet. As the previous reviewer pointed out this album is free of rap/hip-hop guests and influences but that is not really what is important. What is important is how this album establishes Wilson as a contempory artist whose able to cross bridges of generations and changes on the music scene since he began while being true not only to himself but the listener. Overall this album has all the makings of a very positive follow up and I'm looking forward to hearing it when it comes.\n", "val": 0.008958480320870876}
{"text": "If this is Just Charlie then I don't know what else to write because I'm writing this review AS I LISTEN TO IT.  This newest release by Charlie Wilson is what I've been waiting on from him.  Classic ballads and jammin midtempo tracks without the rap.  Nothing against rap in an R&B song when its done tastefully, but Charlie doesn't need it.  This CD is slammin, that is all I can say.  This is truly for the grown folks.  If you like Charlie Wilson you will love this CD.  Contemporary and yet modern at the same time.  No one can take a song home like Charlie can.  This cd far surpasses his last one by leaps and bounds even with his great hit \"There goes my baby\"  Just buy it and see for yourself.  It is a complete body of work.\n", "val": 0.024100612848997116}
{"text": "This is one great album from Charlie Wilson when I saw it on sale for five dollars i downloaded it right away. Just Charlie is Charlie Wilson's fifth studio album and one of my favorites so far. This cd has a great R&B sound to it and mixes his old material from when he was a member of the gap band to the new material which is more comparable to singers like usher and Tyrese Gibson. All in all this album was mixed and produced very good, which in my opinion is what led to the album Reaching  number  19 on the Billboard top 200 charts and No. 2 on the Billboard R&B Album chart selling 57,286 copies in its first week.\n", "val": 0.032444585114717484}

{"text": "I heard the song \"You Are\" on the radio & just had to have it as part of my collection. Then found out it was done by Charlie Wilson. I usually purchase my CD's from Amazon & usually listen to the clips before buying a CD. The only song I really knew was \"You Are\" If all the other songs were no good I would not have bought the CD. I was pleasantly surprised with almost every song clip I heard.\"My Girl Is A Dime\" is my second favorite. So I decided that maybe I could buy a couple of his CD's because it seems I stumbled upon a gem. I was very impressed with the reviews of the other CD's. Most people who did not like this CD - \"Just Charlie\" did not like the modern electric sound to his voice. Lot's of singers are now doing this 'synthesized' sound & I don't mind it at all. As a matter of fact I like it! I have bought Cd's of the following artists that have done it: Madonna, Jaimie Foxx, Britney Spears, Chris Brown, among others. So getting back to Charlie Wilson; I was not as impressed with his other albums & ended up with just buying this one. The others all sounded good, but this was the best in my estimation. It turned out as I expected. It is a great album. I understand where the purist are coming from that don't want that synthesized sound, I enjoy it.\n", "val": 0.015602597035467625}

I had hoped it would have \"There goes my baby\" on it however. I guess it came out a while back; further back than I thought. I love this man as a musician and I especially love his story of redemption and how he met his wife. He brings hope to a certain population and even anybody who is in a bad place and I look forward to that book he talked about writing a while back.I wasn't able to buy as many copies of the CD as I wanted to boost his first week sales but I am about to buy a few more as Christmas presents for my soulful people.Kudos Uncle Charlie!!!\n", "val": 0.011335455812513828}
{"text": "This is a fantastic solid CD release by the talented R 'n B singer-songwriter & producer Charlie Wilson, titled \"Just Charlie\". This fantastic CD has 10 great tracks. The opening track, \"My Girl Is A Dime\" is great track : great (guitar, vocals, chorus & harmonies). Other great tracks include \"You Are\" (great lyrics), \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" (great drums/bass combinations, great varied pitch vocals & the song featuring the fabulous Fantasia), \"Life Of The Party\" (great dance track with great vocals), \"I Can't Go\", \"Crying For You\" & \"Where Would I Be?\" (Great harmonies). The only okay/good track is \"Never Got Enough\" & there is no weak track on this fantastic CD to really speak of. Solid tracks include \"Once And Forever\" (a beautiful ballad track, wonderful music, great vocals & very persuasive lyrics) & \"Lotto\" (fantastic sound intro, wonderful piano note pickings throughout the song, great rhythm guitar thrown appropriately at intervals, great melody & chorus. Singer has got definitely a great & impressive lady declaring, \"Feels like I hit the Lotto...\" This is my favourite track from this fantastic CD & hence the title of my review. On overall, I was pleasantly surprised & blown away by the beautiful R 'n B music, vocals & lyrics on this CD release \"Just Charlie\" by the great Charlie Wilson, a highly recommended listening.

Unlike Trey Songz and these young cats' singing now, I rank Charlie right in the top five of all active R&B artist today. Reverse his role with any of them and he would improve their vocals. I hate when people put in music and listen to it as a fan. Don't just hear the music,listen to it. He has 5 singles right now on this album and I guarantee that! He's in heavenly in rotation right! To that's a sign of a great voice. The man is in his 60's holding it down and keeping our music alive. Not just have a beat with chants! Great album!Coach,\n", "val": 0.016688335686922073}

I doubt I'll buy this record because I don't like the songwriting and how it was produced.

{"text": "I have been a fan of Lori McKenna for a few years now, and I continue to be impressed with the albums she releases - and Lorraine is no exception. It seems lately that artists release 2 or 3 good albums, then just give up, buy not Lori McKenna.The album starts with \"Luxury of Knowing\" - a song written by McKenna, but originally released by Keith Urban - is deep and a classic McKenna song. Lori McKenna shows a more vulnerable side on the final track \"Still Down Here\". Anyone who appreciates small towns and classic young love will enjoy \"Buy This Town\" and \"You Get A Love Song\".Needless to say, this is McKenna's best album to date. It is sure to satisfy multiple genre lovers.\n", "val": 0.03244175389409065}
{"text": "I've been a fan of Lori's music for several years, and \"Lorraine\" is a welcome rebound from the good, but Nashville-slick \"Unglamorous.\" The biggest change here is the inclusion of several piano-based songs, which are the early standouts on an album full of excellent tunes. \"If He Tried\" is one of them, and the best is album closer \"Still Down Here\", one of the finest songs she's ever done.Too early to tell whether \"Lorraine\" is as good as the brilliant \"Bittertown\", but that's a tough album to top, and second place in Lori's gem of a catalog is still a great spot to be in.\n", "val": 0.031011614948511124}

The songs are mostly slow paced, but it's the words that really capture your attention. She has a good voice, and writes compelling lyrics. Really nice songs for those pensive days. For me it was a nice new find. If you like singers like Kim Taylor, Ryan Calhoun, Greg Laswell or the Cary Brothers, you would like Lori McKenna as well. The best tracks for me on this album are The Most, All I Ever Do, Rocket Science and That's How You Know.\n", "val": 0.04310150071978569}
{"text": "Lori McKenna has been one of the very best singer/songwriters for some time now, in the league of the best we've ever heard. But her artistry keeps growing. Although she has written brilliant songs in the past, this album is consistently richer and deeper than earlier albums. I've been trying to put my finger on why. I think it has something to do with the fact that, while she has always been true to her own perceptions and feelings, now every character in her life and stories (boyfriend, husband, children, rivals, neighbors,....) is treated with understanding and is rendered in 3-dimensional emotional depth. She's creating powerful, beautiful poetry and music. Don't miss this album.\n", "val": 0.03773839771747589}

Lori McKenna is a major talent and it's all come together on her new album \"Lorraine\".  For me, this is by far the best batch of songs she's ever written.  Even those who love \"Bittertown\" will be impressed by the expanded and detailed emotional scope explored by this album.  Each of these songs brings so much emotional texture to the table that it's almost overwhelming to listen straight through.  The highlights for me are \"That's How You Know\", \"The Luxury of Knowing\", \"Ladders and Parchutes\", \"Rocket Science\", \"All I Ever Do\", \"The Most\" (the clear \"single\"), and, of course, \"Still Down Here\".  \"Still Down Here\" is probably the best song that Lori has ever written and may be one of the most powerful songs I've heard it years. There's so many gems here.  So much to savor. Lori has now reached the upper echelon of singer-songwriters alongside Patty Griffin - to whom she is often compared.\n", "val": 0.03891434893012047}

Lori's first name is actually Lorriane and she was named after her mother who died when Lori was 7 years old.  The title track is a beautiful reflective tribute to her.  This CD is a great followup to \"Unglamorous\" which was produced by Tim McGraw after Faith Hill fell in love with some of her songs.  The arraignments on this CD are a little sparser, which gives it a beautiful sound.  Lori is an excellent songwriter and the songs on this CD sound very personal.

{"text": "This is the best new recording by a female artist since Court & Spark. Seriously, it's that good. From the 1st line of \"Luxury of Knowing\" you find this isn't some shined up Nashville Lori but more like her heart felt Kitchen Tapes LP. Song after song is a stroll through her ability to pen the world of the working class who are lucky enough to still have a sense of innocence. \"You Get a Love Song\" is exactly that. I remeber the first time I heard it I couldn't turn it up loud enough. I just wish they had turned down the mike on the background singer who keeps repeating lines, he's annoying. The closing track \"I'm Still Down Here\" will put a lump in your throat, if not a tear down your face. It's a very personal goodbye to a loved one & it is nothing short of a masterpiece.The CD stayed in my player for weeks. There's such a wonderful recording of a mix of musical ideas you just don't get tried of it. I'm sure other artists will find hits off Lorraine, but the radio world is really missing a it without giving \"All I Ever Do\" airplay. I can't imagine a better recording by such a wonderfully gifted artist.Seriously, it's that good!\n", "val": 0.011604965664446354}

Every song on Cannibal was worth listening to! In Harold's Song, Ke$ha proved to us that she can sing with very minimal autotuning! Overall, this CD set is worth purchasing. However, the CD set doesn't have a cover booklet. I buy all my CDs because I love collecting these booklets! This set was short of that! :(\n", "val": 0.0034253362100571394}

{"text": "Since this album contains both `Animal' and `Cannibal' I just decided to post my reviews for both albums here.  There is nothing special that comes from buying this version other than you save a buck or two depending on where you buy it from.  It would have been nice had she given us some B-Side tracks or some remixes or something that validated buying the album, but then again, if you don't own either and want them both then get this one.First; `Animal':\"When Ke$ha blew up the radio waves with `TiK ToK' I was kind of bewildered.  I mean, the song was catchy and fun to a degree, but she sounded BEYOND drunk and shallow to an extreme, and when she started getting nominated for Grammy's I was taken even further back.  I mean, she didn't seem to have a lot of talent.I finally got out of my own head and decided to buy this album and check it out.I get it now.I've been listening to this album (along with `Cannibal' and her new remix album) nearly non-stop for the last couple weeks and I'm still wrapped up in it.  It's flawed, sure.  There are some songs on this album that just don't work that well, but overall there is far too much good here to dismiss Ke$ha as a talentless hack, sucked into the media storm surrounding her strange sense of style.  She isn't just a `dirty little freak' given more credit than is due.  If anything, she isn't regarded as well as she should be.  This girl not only has a voice (stop acting drunk Ke$ha, you have pipes so use them more) but she has swagger that makes her songs infectious.  As much as I claimed to dislike her for so long, I NEVER change the station when one of her songs comes on since, well, I love listening to this girl.I mean, who doesn't find something strangely endearing about Ke$ha's onslaught of radio singles?  The albums singles aren't completely indicative of this artist as a whole (maybe I shouldn't go so far as to call her an artist) but it doesn't hurt the cause.  `TiK ToK' may be the worst overall single, and it's still a fun and flirty song that sticks in your head.  `Your Love Is My Drug' is above and beyond my favorite song by Ke$ha.  It is just so boisterous and bouncy and fun and insanely catchy.  It was one of the first POP songs I learnt to play on the guitar, and this was all before I admitted to myself that I liked this girl, the song is that good.  `Take It Off' is just such a ridiculously filthy club track that is filthy in all the right ways.  If this doesn't illicit endless hours of rave-like gyrating then I don't know what will.  `Dancing With Tears In My Eyes' is another side, a softer side, to Ke$ha.  It isn't her best trip down this isle (`Hungover', without doubt or question) but this side to Ke$ha is nicely constructed here.  It retains her catchy pop style, but it adds a layer of heartbreak that sits on her well.As good as the singles are, the rest of the album mostly exceeds her promise.My favorite tracks on the album, outside of `Your Love Is My Drug' include the lovelorn `Hungover', the vengeful anthem `Kiss and Tell', the achingly sincere `Blind' and the throwback jingle `Backstabber'.  `Backstabber' is such a cool change of pace, recalls to mind an almost modernized jazz feel with elevated club beats and feisty lyrics.  `Kiss and Tell' rides the same vein as `Your Love Is My Drug' in the musical department, this song taking a different lyrical approach (that of a cheating boyfriend).  The chorus is catchy as all get out and it is just a load of bouncy fun.  `Hungover' is soft and gentle and is the closest thing to `haunting' Ke$ha has on the album.  `Blind' is just beautifully constructed.  It shows that vulnerable side to Ke$ha, and strips away her trademark `drunk singing' and shows us what she can really do vocally.  Why wasn't this song a single?  Why didn't they introduce her as a more serious contender to the pop world?  She has more talent (vocally) than Britney Spears and yet whoever was in charge of her exposure botched that up.`Blah Blah Blah' is fun and fresh.  It feels a little dated, but in a fun way.  Ke$ha does fall into the whole `shallow' category thanks to her endless barrage of ill-advised lyrics, but it doesn't mean she isn't fun.  She's not as artistically focused as Lady Gaga, so she can't always get away with the density of lyrics, but she understands her audience very well, so it kind of doesn't matter.  `Animal' is a good song, but I think the remix album spoiled me, since the `Switch Remix' is just so brilliant.`Steven' is okay, and it is a different song for her (although the obvious Imogen Heap inspired opener is kind of obnoxious).  The song grows on you, but it just doesn't work as well as the majority of the album.  I feel about `Boots and Boys' kind of how I feel about `Beautiful, Dirty, Rich' by Gaga; painfully tacky by fun nonetheless.  `Party at a Rich Dudes House' is fun but dumb and does nothing for Ke$ha as an artist.`Dinosaur' is just bad.So, in the end, as you can see, I really like this girl.  There, I said it.  I know, it totally makes no sense but what can I say; she delivers.  If you are expecting something truly original or something that will stand the test of time then LOOK ELSEWHERE, but if you want some primo-pop that will get you moving and will surpass your expectations then sink into this one.It's far better than you think it is!\"Second; `Cannibal':\"Despite the fact that the Billboard Remix of `Animal' is superb and `Blow' is just, well, perfect; this album just doesn't do it for me.  There are only nine tracks here and the majority of them feel cheap and rushed and unfocused and nowhere near the level of surprise and excitement that I felt when listening to `Animal'.So yeah, `Blow' is awesome and just works like magic.  The bass lines are explosive and the overall energy is insane here.  Her best club track, period.  I love that breakdown at the end (\"make it rain on em\"), but the entire song is flawless.  The Billboard Remix of `Animal' has most of the haunting texture that was accomplished in the `Switch Remix' on her `Dance Commander' album.  It's eerie and complex and layered beautifully; just superb.`The Harold Song' is soft and pretty, and the chorus swells upward with perfect pitch, but it feels less entrancing than her better attempts at that vulnerable sound.  `Sleazy' is fun, although the remix featuring Andre 3000 is FAR better.  It's fun and flirty though, and so you'll enjoy it.  `C U Next Tuesday' is a different sound for Ke$ha and it works to a degree.  It isn't too memorable, but it has a dreamy quality that is kind of enchanting while you are listening to it.OK, I kind of like `Grow a Pear', although I have to say that it is the definition of tacky and doesn't really work, despite the pre-chorus being kind of brilliant (\"you should kno-o-oo-oo-ooow\").  It's a crazy song really, and for shock value it works (she says mangina, so she gets props for that) but it's also kind of beyond stupid.I like `We R Who We R' to a certain degree, but it's probably my least favorite single she's released.`Cannibal' has a nice beat and all but it's also just downright tacky with no real substance or point.  This is Ke$ha buying into what the media wants her to be; a trashy whore.  She is better than this, and she even shows us that in moments of the song where her vocals far outweigh the disgustingly shallow material.  The tribal beat is kind of cool, but I hate the thoughtless lyrical content.  `Crazy Beautiful Life' is also rather vapid to tell you the truth, but the bouncy `Blue October'-lite beat almost makes up for the content.This album would have been MUCH better had it had five or six more tracks with some substance.  I mean, this is kind of like taking what she did in `Animal' and cutting it in half, and you needed those extra tracks to make up for missteps and add that something special to the album.  Instead it comes off a tad halfhearted.\"In conclusion, this works quite well and I have no regrets over indulging in some teenage pop trashiness that is far better than I expected it to be.\n", "val": 9.008452616399154e-05}

The lead single, We R Who We R, sounds exactly like Tik Tok but isn't as good as her first smash single.Bottom line: If you have Animal, you basically already have the new songs.

{"text": "Well, here I am.  I never thought I'd be reviewing a Kesha album.  I was one of those people who used to deride pop music as \"poor quality fodder for the weak masses\" when I was younger, but I have since become more diverse and eclectic in my musical tastes over time.  Still, I never thought I would have grown fond of Kesha, of all people - one of the most disliked and disrespected pop artists out there, often held out as a shining example of the degradation of quality present in modern music.  Still, I find myself strangely attracted to her music, and I truly love this album.  I'm now going to go through each song individually, and give a brief explanation of my feelings on them.\"Your Love Is My Drug\" (5/5) - Though the metaphor of comparing the rush of love to feeling of drug-induced highs is hardly an original concept, this is still a nice song.  The lyrics aren't particularly inspired or insightful, but the beat and chorus are infectious enough to keep one entertained for the duration of the song.\"Tik Tok\" (5/5) - This is arguably Kesha's most well-known song, and it's a good one.  I know many point to this song as merely an example of poor lyricism over a catchy electronic beat, but I honestly like this song.  The feel of the song is very energetic, and the lyrics accurately capture the feeling of pure, unfettered freedom from societal constraints.  You truly get the sense that the narrating character  of the song (an idealized version of Kesha herself, perhaps) really and honestly does not give a f*** whether or not using \"a bottle of Jack\" as a dental hygiene tool is within acceptable cultural norms.  I especially love this song because the listener of the song gets to vicariously enjoy the feeling of energetic, reckless freedom the song portrays, but without the inherent dangers realistically living such a lifestyle would actually entail.  Also, it does make me wonder what it feels like to be P. Diddy...\"Take It Off\" (5/5) - If \"Tik Tok\" merely touched upon the heady delight of hedonistic freedom, this song exemplifies it to a much greater degree.  The lyrics paint an image of chaotic, unbridled, almost animalistic pleasures taking place - even though the location may not be the most glamorous.  Indeed, the venue is described as \"dirty\" and a \"hole in the wall,\" foreshadowing future songs that showcase a disdain for upper class aesthetics.  The heavy autotune is used here as well, not as a crutch for a poor singer, but more as a full-blown vocal effect (as with much of her music) and I find it quite enjoyable.  This song always fills me with energy!\"Kiss N Tell\" (4/5) - This really isn't one of my favorite Kesha songs.  It's not a very interesting song lyrically, but it's musically catchy enough to keep me entertained.\"Stephen\" (4/5) - This also isn't one of my preferred songs.  I can't quite tell if it's meant to be taken seriously or not, but I suspect it's a joke song.  The song is catchy and listenable for the most part, but the parts where Kesha effects an odd tone of voice (almost like a failed attempt at an accent) do grate upon my nerves a bit.  Thankfully, it's a really short part, and the song ends before it outstays its welcome.\"Blah Blah Blah ft. 3OH\" (5/5) - I know a lot of people dislike the chorus on this song, and I can understand why.  Listening to the words \"blah blah blah\" over and over again could be annoying, but in my opinion the song goes just far enough without being overbearing about it.  The music is catchy as you'd expect, but also lyrically somewhat interesting.  The song features one of Kesha's many sexual pursuits and portrays an image of a woman with powerful, dominant sexual urges and does so without an ounce of guilt or shame, which is (along with other songs of hers on the same subject matter) where much of Kesha's reputation for \"sluttiness\" comes from.  I, however, applaud this view of strong female sexuality unburdened by gendered double-standards (and honestly, if a similar song as this had been sung by a male rapper, for example, no one would have batted an eye, which exactly proves my point).  I have heard the original unofficial version and the one on the album that includes 3OH!3.  They don't add a whole lot in my opinion, but don't really hurt the song either, so either version is worth listening to.\"Hungover\" (5/5) - This is one of my favorite songs off of the album because it is the very first song on the album that showcases Kesha's softer side.  This song could be interpreted as a simple song about missing a love interest who has left after a brief fling at a party, but I see deeper meaning in it.  After several tracks celebrating the bright, fiery energy of unrestrained hedonism, this song is a rather poignant counterpoint to the joys of such a lifestyle.  To me, this track represents the darker aspects of a life of constant indulgence.  First off, the title itself, \"Hungover,\" illustrates this since a hangover is technically the unpleasant consequence of the fun of being drunk previously.  Not only is this song just about the more tangible pains such as regretting a lost love interest, or the feelings of loneliness after a party, but it also perfectly captures a hollow feeling of almost existential emptiness.  The inevitable consequence after the hedonistic high is the unpleasant crash - leaving the narrator with the uncomfortable, disquieting question of \"what went wrong?\"\"Party At a Rich Dude's House\" (5/5) - After a song as meaningful as \"Hungover,\" hearing this song next almost gives me whiplash.  This is about as light-hearted as one can get.  The lyrics match the title, as this is just a fun song about a party at a \"rich dude's house\".  Kesha, as usual, shows her irreverent disdain for the trappings of wealth.  The song does feel a bit jarring after \"Hungover\" but it could be seen as an attempt to lighten the mood for the listener after such a heavy song, and it IS fun to listen to (especially that bit about throwing up in the closet), so I can't complain.\"Backstabber\" (4/5) - This is another song that's not really one of my favorites.  It's just okay.  The chorus is just a bit too repetitive for my tastes, and the lyrical content isn't particularly interesting.  Still, it's a decent enough song, and it doesn't last longer than it should.\"Blind\" (5/5) - This is one of the songs that I really like.  It is just a very straight forward song about a breakup, but the driving beat and strong chorus keep it catchy and enjoyable to listen to.\"Dinosaur\" (5/5) - This is purely a joke song meant to amuse.  To that end, it succeeds.  The lyrics are humorous enough and I do enjoy the bit of word play involved with spelling out the word dinosaur and having the last two letters made up by the words \"you are\" (and no, I didn't pick up on that the very first time I listened to this song - clearly, I am an idiot).  Anyway, \"Dinosaur\" is a very fun and light-hearted song that always makes me crack a smile.\"Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\" (5/5) - This is another more downbeat song.  Unlike \"Hungover\" this one doesn't stir feelings of existential angst - this is a much more straight forward song about a lost love due to breakup (I assume).  Unlike \"Blind\" where the tone was more one of defiant indignation, this song is clearly about sadness and heartbreak.  It's a lovely song, and I enjoy it.\"Boots and Boys\" (3/5) - Sadly, it seems like a great many albums have that one not-so-good song that serves as the filler song.  It's a song that's dull, uninteresting, and put on the album solely to take up space - and this is that song.  The chorus is just too repetitive for my liking and the lyrics are really boring after all the stronger songs on the album.  The only thing that keeps it from a lower score is the fact that it isn't so terrible as to be totally unlistenable.  Still, as far as filler songs go, while this could have been cut or replaced with something better, it's really not as bad as it could have been.  Frankly, we're lucky that it's the only filler song on the album.\"Animal\" (5/5) - This is a great standout song on this album.  It really speaks to the idea of \"living in the moment\" as it details the story of of someone who desperately wants to cling to their relationship just as it is, but knows that this goal is somehow futile.  We never really learn why this is an unattainable goal, but the intensity of that desperate yearning is there nevertheless.  This is truly a beautiful song.\"VIP\" (5/5) - This is a bonus track that comes on the Animal + Cannibal Deluxe Edition.  It's definitely one of my favorites.  It's got an absolutely swinging beat, a catchy chorus, and some interesting lyrics, to boot.  The song details Kesha's disdain for the elitist VIP culture, and is definitely worth a listen.\"Dirty Picture Pt. 2\" (5/5) - This is the second bonus song from the Deluxe version, and I really like it too.  It's a rather sexually charged song (that's about the exact thing the title says) with a catchy chorus and it always gets me pumped!  You'll notice the \"Pt. 2\" in the title.  There is actually an original, alternate version of this song that doesn't feature Taoi Cruz.  I've listened to it and I honestly feel this version is the better one - he definitely adds the song and makes it sound better.Overall Score (5/5): NOTE this score is not a mathematical average of previous scores; it's my subjective overall score.  Even though every single song on this album is not an instant knock-out, I still feel like most of them are good enough to really make this album equal more than the sum of its parts.  It's a fun and enjoyable album and it really puts me in a good mood, and the variety of songs help paint a picture of Kesha as a complex person - possessing both a wild partying side and a softer side.  Overall, it's a great first release.  Note that I did indeed buy the Deluxe 2 Disc version with the Cannibal EP included, but this review is long enough as it is, so I'm going to review that EP separately under its own separate amazon listing.  Go check that out if it interests you.  As for this set, however, I do strongly suggest you buy the 2 Disc Deluxe version if you don't already own Animal or Cannibal by themselves.  You can save a bit of money that way (and get the excellent bonus tracks), and both are definitely worth having.\n", "val": 0.018734395503997803}

{"text": "I have to start with some background on how I got this: I absolutely love Britney's \"Femme Fatal\" album, and of course Ke$ha co-wrote the smash-hit \"Till the World Ends\" from that album. My daughter kept telling me this sumemr \"you gotta check out Ke$ha, you'll love it\", but I never gave it much thought (nor do I listen to mainstream commercial radio). Last month I was visiting Edinburgh, Scotland and there I saw this 2 CD set on sale at a large CD store for such a ridiculously low amount (5 British pounds for the set) that I just had to pick it up, sound unheard. Came home and my daughter suggested I start with the Cannibal CD, and so I did.\"Animal + Cannibal\" (2 CDs; 26 tracks; 90 min., plus 3 videos) is the combo \"special deluxe edition\" of Ke$ha's 2 albums from last year. \"Cannibal\" (10 tracks; 36 min.) is an incredibly strong collection, with hardly any filler on it. The first 4 tracks \"Cannibal\", \"We R Who We R\", \"Sleazy\" and \"Blow\" are (along with some of Britney's new stuff) some of the most enjoyable and infectuous mainstream stuff that I've heard in a long time. After a so-so \"The Harold Song\", it immediately picks up again with great stuff like \"Crazy Beautiful Life\" and \"C U Next Tuesday\". The final track \"The Sleazy Remix\" is not much of a remix, to be honest. This \"deluxe\" edition also contains 3 music videos (Stephen; Animal; Take It Off). I rate \"Cannibal\" 4.5 stars.\"Animal\" (16 tracks, including 2 bonus tracks; 54 min.) is not nearly as strong for me compared to \"Cannibal\". Sure, there are several great tracks such as opener \"Your Love Is My Drug\", \"Take It Off\", \"Blah Blah Blah\", and a few others. Knowing how big a hit \"Tik Tok\" had been, I couldn't help but be disappointed when I heard it, as it certainly isn't the strongest song on here. This \"deluxe\" edition comes with two bonus tracks: the excellent \"VIP\" and the okay \"Dirty Picture\". I rate \"Animal\" 3.5 stars.In all, quite the collection, and for what I paid for it in Scotland, an absolute steal!\n", "val": 0.00021745401318185031}

At least 3 others are good enough for working out to.  Her reputation is a trashy, drunk college partier, which is sort of new in the pop scene. Interesting angle.Cons: Her lyrics are rediculously amature.  The background instruments/synthasizer sounds like a cheap 4-track system rushed together.  In my opinion, her voice is mediocre, and none of the songs give her the ability to showcase her full ability.  Her best songs are the ones on the radio.Surprise: Half of her songs are slow and introspective; a strange combination when her others talk about dancing and flirting with guys.I would suggest just downloading the \"radio hits\" to save you the $20 of a new dual CD.\n", "val": 5.348409104044549e-05}

For those hyper-ventilators I would like to say that I review these albums against one another. I think that it is really the only fair way to review an artists work - is as compared to his existing body of work. It is tough to compare and critique between artists, because often it is a case of apples and oranges. Keep in mind that 3 Stars for EJ in my world is another artist's 5 Star rating. I am not comparing them. I am comparing what EJ has done with what EJ has done. With that said, this is a good album. A lot of great stuff, good arrangements, great production and mix, etc., but some of the songs should have been left in the vault and saved for another \"Souvenir\" album - such as \"Austin\". However, with that shot across the bow out of my system, songs like \"Brilliant Room\" and \"On The Way\" I enjoy as much as anything he has done before. I also love \"Texas\" and \"Arithmetic\".  And \"Vortexan\", along with \"A Change Has Come to Me\" with its reprise are fabulous also. If you love EJ, then you are going to love this album. If you like EJ, you are going to like this album.

Not that is sounds worse (or better) its just different.  But its still an amazing CD, the first track just slays me.  As a musician I am going to steal, borrow and be inspired by it.  Which is the highest complement I could give it.

{"text": "This is the first album recorded entirely in Johnson's home studio (which reportedly took Johnson 15 years to build). The sound of the record doesn't come across as quite as sterile as his previous studio albums ,and the addition of several guest artists really adds to the looser vibe. By Eric Johnson's standards, the five year gap between 2005's \"Bloom\" and 2010's Up Close is not unexpected. It's the shortest time between albums since \"Ah Via Musicom\" followed \"Tones\" by four years.  Although \"Up Close\" couldn't be called spontaneous, it does have a looseness that's often absent in Johnson's previous studio work.  \"Up Close\" is Eric Johnson served straight-up: it is not far removed from the feel of \"Ah Via Musicom\",  but does lack some of  the major melodic motifs that resonated so much with crossover listeners.\n", "val": 8.720290497876704e-05}

EJ needs to go back to his roots, and try to recapture his old sound and style, and song-writing.Even one of EJ's recent guitar instruction videos (2006?), which had songs released nowhere else, had songs that were really good.  And that wasn't even the point of the video.  It was for guitar lessons.  So I know EJ still has music-writing talent, but something is getting in his way...\n", "val": 6.334533827612177e-05}
{"text": "Two disclosures:  I'm not a musician and I've been a fan since 2004ish.This is a good album with some flaws.  Mr. Johnson has said in interviews that this album was an opportunity to let go of some of his perfectionism (not all) and get closer to his audience, something he started in the previous album, Bloom.  You can hear it, in a good way, in this album.  Overall, it has a sense of fun and openness that isn't as clear on his previous albums.  Though I only liked half the songs when I first heard them, I like all but one now.\"Fat Daddy,\" is a fun ride.  \"Brilliant Room\" has amazing lyrics and a great performance by Malford Milligan.  \"Gem\" is easily my favorite with the koto-like opening and clear delivery.  \"Vortexan\" made me want to drive around Dallas at night while listening to it;  seems the perfect backdrop with just enough city to balance out the country, dancing along a blues edge.  \"On The Way\" is a pure, upbeat country song that got my foot tapping.  It's easily the most fun song on the album.  \"Arithmetic\" does a beautiful job of reminding me of the important people in my life.  It has a reference at the end of the song to God's judgment of our lives, though Mr. Johnson puts it in the context of who we've loved.  Very nice.  \"A Change Has Come to Me\" didn't start out as a song I liked due to the lyrics (they struck me as messy and a little too New Agey).  However, I find I enjoy the simple beginning that gradually becomes more complex as the song unfolds.  \"Your Book\", a song Mr. Johnson wrote for his father, is a wonderful statement regarding how any book written or movie made about our lives can never really capture the fascinating complexity and depths of who we are.That said, there are weak points.  First, the interludes.  He's said in an interview that they were originally done as one take and broken up for the album.  Unfortunately, to my ears, they sound it.Second, and this just might be a personal preference, I didn't like the guest vocals, especially the first time listening to them.  The vocalists themselves are fantastic.  However, on first listen, they sound like EJ imitators.  It took a while to realize that they were probably trying to fit in with EJ's style.  I think I would have appreciated either a more distinctive take on the songs or Eric Johnson himself singing on them.  Though I wasn't overly impressed with his voice the first time I heard it on Ah Via Musicom, I've really come to enjoy it and look forward to his vocals.  That's why I say this may just be a personal preference.  To stress the point, everyone he has on his album does a fantastic job.Finally, I didn't like the CD case.  It's made entirely of cardboard/paper.  When I opened it up, it took a bit to wrap my head around the fact that the CD was placed in the left hand slot, in a dust jacket just like an LP.  It's quaint and confusing at first.  The lyrics/credit sheet are in the right hand slot.  Because of this, the CD case is a little \"chunkier\" than some other cases.  It has a tendency to widen out at the open end, which makes it difficult to easily slide the case into a slot.  For those who have kids, the case design makes it more difficult to correctly hold the CD when you take it out (whether it's one of the kids or you holding one of the kids).  Some may call mentioning this superficial, but I use the case to take the CD with me.  No matter how cute it looks, it's a hassle and I hope this isn't the trend for the future.  If so, I'll download my next EJ album.In all, this is a very good album and definitely worth the money.\n", "val": 0.014501815661787987}
{"text": "There have been many long, detailed and opinionated reviews - but hey, aren't all reviews just someone's opinion?  I've read several and am surprised that no one has yet mentioned the fact that Vortexan sounds a bit familiar.  It could almost be an alternate version of Righteous - very similar chord progression. Anyway, as with all other EJ albums, there are some songs I love and others I'm not crazy about even though the guitar playing is always top notch and amazing.  I have never been a big fan of Eric's vocals.  I just don't care for the sound of his voice. He is an okay singer at best.  So, I tend to be more enamored with the instrumental tunes.  Fortunately, he got Johnny Lang (who is a fine singer) to sing Austin which is my favorite song on the album.  Johnny does a superb job and Eric does his usual incredible playing with some really nice licks on this particular tune.  The guitar riff break leading into the first guitar solo is very cool.  The song builds to an uplifting ending, greatly added to by the vocals, and then finishes with one of Eric's trademark awesome ending licks.  This song gives me goosebumps.  Other highlights for me are Fatdaddy which is a fun rocker with cool modulations and scales, and Gem which is just a gorgeous tune.  Brilliant Room is also a fine tune and I would probably like it better if someone else was singing it.  Some people have criticized the song Texas but it's just what it is supposed to be - a blues tune.  Eric does a great job of putting his own unique stamp on the blues.  Steve Miller does an ample job handling the vocals in a very blues like manner.  I like Jimmy Vaughn but I think it is a bit superfluous to have him adding another guitar solo to the song increasing it's somewhat drawn out length.  Eric's tone, sound, technique and unusual chord voicings are always stunning no matter what.  Overall, this is another great album from EJ and if you are a fan, buy it, you won't be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.034215908497571945}

{"text": "This is another brilliant album from Eric Johnson and is a \"must buy\" for any fan of the electric guitar.  Each Eric Johnson disk has its own feeling, tempo and character -- this one is no different.  Up Close has several highlights and only a few songs that won't wind up on my go-to playlist.  I am wavering between four and five stars only because while I feel four is the right number today, I am sure that after another few months of listening, Up Close will be a five star album.The album gets off to a tremendous start with Fatdaddy and Brilliant Room (with Malford Milligan).  Brilliant Room may be my favorite but with each listening other songs catch my ear so the vote is not yet final.  Texas features Steve Miller on vocals and some very bluesy guitar work by EJ.  Gem is another frontrunner with absolutely beautiful, classic Eric Johnson tone, tempo and complexity.  Traverse builds anticipation then simply bridges to Austin.  Austin, featuring Jonny Lang on vocals and some smoking guitar work by EJ, is one of the songs that has really grown on me.  On The Way is a fun \"chicken pickin'\" song that demonstrates EJ's ability to cross style lines.  Arithmetic is a classic EJ ballad with the pure vocals and guitar playing that make every Eric Johnson album worth the price.  Vortexan is a driving romp with a familiar feel for all EJ fans.  At first, I was not fond of A Change has Come to Me, perhaps because it comes so late on the disk and other, earlier, pieces had dominated it.  But I am finding that if I play the disc on shuffle mode, it captures my ear and I am liking it much more when I give it the attention it deserves.It is hard to compare any new album with Ah Via Musicom and expect it to compete well.  I felt the same way with Bloom and Venus Isle but each of those get equal playtime.  Up Close holds its own among my Eric Johnson collection and against other albums by my favorite guitarists and is well worth the money spent to enjoy it.\n", "val": 0.025495408102869987}

Jimi had Mitch, Jeff had his Vinnie and Terry and John McLaughlin had his Billy Cobham, just to name a few pairs of guitar players/drummers that could literally carry an instrumental all by themselves. Maybe someone has others that come to mind.In any case, he is simply not being musically challenged by a Drummer of equal or greater talent than his. This is meant as no offense to the drummer on the album, he does a journeyman job. But the ordinary technique just doesn't cut it for me. My advice is for EJ to get out of his comfort zone, think outside the box, start jamming with some other drummers and see what happens.Give Stewart Copeland or Lenny White a call for crying out loud!\n", "val": 4.6745848521823063e-05}

His inefficiency of making albums every one or two years makes us longing for more of his new music.What's more joyful is the fact that two CDs are released at the same time.  It's this Up Close and the Austin City Limits CD+DVD.  I got Up Close before Christmas and it's been playing non stop in my car.  You pick up new things every time you listen to a EJ song.  Up Close is no exception.  The songs sound better with time and it is the best guitar CD in the last few years.  There are plenty of signature of guitar tunes throughout Up Close.  Special guests are Steve Miller, Jonny Lang, Sonny Landreth and others.  You will be touched by the last two vocal tracks: A Change Has Come To Me and Your Book (I bet Celine Dion would make this into a huge hit, I hope Sony Music is reading this).

There is some good playing here but over all just sort of a so so experience. Was hoping for more after the usual long hiatus. Still, if you're a fan then it's worth having.

{"text": "Like many of my favorite albums, this one grew on me the more I listened to it.  Eric has some guest singers on a few tracks, which was cool.  His lead tone has evolved over the years.  There's definitely less delay on this album than in the past; giving it a more natural sound.  I like it.Instrumental Tunes:  'Fatdaddy' and 'Vortexan' to me seem like generic bluesy-rock space-fillers without much meat.  I felt the same way about 'Camel's Night Out' and some of Eric's other previous tracks.  Conversely, the instrumental tune 'Gem' is catchy.  Think 'Pavilion'.  I think the chicken pickin' tune 'On the Way' is unremarkable.Vocal Tunes: Honestly, I've always found Eric's lyrics a bit trite and obtuse.  I felt the same about 'A Change Has Come to Me', 'Brilliant Room', 'Your Book', and 'Arithmetic' at first as well.  The fantastic phrasing between lines, Hendrixy tone, and catchy melody on '...Change' finally won me over.  'Brilliant Room' has some great leads.  'Arithmetic' has a good message and probably has some deep meaning for Eric, and I appreciate it from that level.  The brief intro to 'Arithmetic' is wonderful and reminds me of a more complex version of the intro to 'Take My Hand' by Toto (credits from the movie Dune).All said, I like this album better than 'Bloom' and think it's on par with 'Venus Isle'.

{"text": "Eric has a unique approach to playing, and he's stayed true to his muse since I first heard him over 30 years ago. The 'Lone Wolf' conflict in the 70's may have been good in a way: after that, Eric seemed to focus less on the commercial aspects, and more on the playing - his success being almost incidental. `Staying true' doesn't imply that he doesn't evolve - he does. The harmonic structure of his composing has become more sophisticated, while his soloing has matured - leveraging a rare sense of melody and phrasing (when he's not doing a 'Hendrix thing', he's almost Mozartian in the way his phrases attack harmonic structure and resolve - that's Eric's muse I think). This is a wonderful album that gets better with repeated listening (there's a lot going on there!).But I have to say this: in some ways, Eric suffers from a Sonny Rollins syndrome in terms of capturing his creative energy in the studio. He obviously loves tinkering in the studio - but I swear, he's one of the best live improvisers out there - he can create incredible, complex, beautiful lines that extend endlessly without repeating. Not `guitar licks' dribbling out - substantial musical phrases. Worth listening to - with or without all that SOUND and VOLUME.There are few players that can improvise like that (Rollins being one). Eric is best when he's stretching. I guess, to some degree, the `Alien Lovechild' album does this - and it's good. But that's not enough for me. How many live albums did Miles Davis do (including the studio 'one-takes' that were unrehearsed)? When you have that kind of talent - go for it!\n", "val": 0.015876833349466324}
{"text": "Being a long time fan, its great to see a new EJ album after the wait since 2005's \"Bloom\".Unfortunately, Up Close is a bit hit and miss in its delivery - lots of variety but the album feels disjointed, more like a collection of singles, with too many guest vocal collaborations.That's not to say that the guests don't deliver:- there are some fine performances, particularly Johnny Lang on Austin and Malford Milligan on Brilliant Room. Austin is probably the album highlight (it's also the first single from the CD) with a melody that immediately recalls Stevie Wonder's \"I was made to love her\" - top stuff!Austin is also the best balanced collaboration, allowing EJ to step forward with some fantastic soloing but too often the other vocal tracks seem to showcase mainly the vocalists, and EJ's signature melodic guitar runs rarely take centre stage (see for example Brilliant Room or A Change Has Come to Me.)Texas is a close relation of Red House, and features Steve Miller on vocals. Being EJ, it's technically flawless in performance, but ultimately remains a fairly standard blues number that fails to excite or explore new territory and, at 6+mins long, it actually stops the album's early build up of momentum.On the plus side, Arithmetic and Your Book are both wonderful ballads, with Eric taking lead vocals. It's not new ground for Eric but these are both great songs and touching performances.It's a shame that A Change Has Come to Me doesn't fulfil its early promise, opening with some great chiming tones, some lovely Hendrixy phrasing and a strong chorus but the song never lands the knockout punch, losing direction somewhat in its latter stages, with a reprise section that feels tacked on and awkward.Of the instrumental tracks, Gem is the standout and ranks among EJ's best work - a real signature piece that could easily sit on the classic, Ah Via Musicom. Fatdaddy is punchy and fun, although Soul Surprise is a mid-tempo piece that slips by without really demanding or capturing the listener's attention. Vortexan plays with the riff from \"No One Knows\" by QOTSA before taking us on a Texan boogie in the spirit of early ZZ Top, and is another of the album's high points. On The Way is a country piece, returning to a familiar stylistic theme for Eric and recalling earlier efforts, Steve's Boogie / Tribute to Jerry Reed.As a final aspect to the variety on offer here, there are 3 \"interludes\" throughout the album which sit between tracks but don't actually serve as stylistic or melodic links. Layers of tuneful guitar overdubs & feedback build up, more soundscapes (or noodling if you want to be hyper-critical!) than actual songs. At less than 2 mins each, these pieces aren't substantial enough to develop any musical ideas, so they feel a bit redundant to sit through.Overall, Up Close is certainly a classy effort, full of great playing, writing and vocal performances. The production is also great - loud but clear and dynamic. EJ looks to be aiming for some crossover appeal with the guest vocalists, however the downside of that is the songs don't gel together stylistic which makes the album - as a whole - a less satisfying listening experience.Up Close is not, therefore, a contender for Eric's career-best album (currently Ah Via Musicom with Venus Isle close behind) but it's worth checking out, notably for Austin and Gem which should definitely be on any EJ fan's best-of playlist!\n", "val": 0.0029546977020800114}

{"text": "The first new studio album in five years from Grammy Award-winning Texas guitar hero Eric Johnson has finally arrived, and it's quite the trip - and well worth the wait. Like his other CDs a mix of instrumentals and vocal songs mostly penned by him and showcasing his unique virtuosity on the electric guitar, Up Close includes some of the best work that Johnson has ever written and recorded.The album is dripping with crackling guitars. If a guitar died and went to heaven, this is what heaven would sound like. Johnson is on fire, effortlessly weaving incredible, sparkling solos in and out of both the instrumental and vocal tracks. The vocal songs range from energetic blues and rock numbers to gorgeous, heartfelt ballads. Inspired like never before, Johnson plays and sings with a fervor not present in his previous work. Perhaps Johnson is like a fine vintage wine, improving with age.I was first introduced to the music of Johnson 20 years ago by an employee at a local cable television station I was interning at during my senior year of high school. That was the year Johnson, then 36 years old, released his breakthrough second album, Ah Via Musicom, which achieved the distinction of having three instrumental songs reach the American Top Ten.As accomplished and groundbreaking as Ah Via Musicom and its edgier and sonically more expansive 1996 follow-up, Venus Isle, are, Johnson has really poured his living, breathing essence into Up Close. The result is the best guitar-based album of the last several years, and one of the best guitar-based and general music albums of all time.With Up Close, Johnson is at the top of his game as a guitarist, composer, and singer. He has created a masterwork of soulful jazz/pop/rock fusion that exudes passion, especially through his trademark virtuosic guitar sound. Even with guest vocals by Malford Milligan, Steve Miller, and Johnny Lang, and guitar performances by Jimmie Vaughan, Steve Hennig, and Sonny Landreth, the album is clearly all Eric Johnson up close front and center.\n", "val": 0.04483606293797493}

Being a big fan of Eric's voice, I was skeptical at first of the guest artists. Aside from a \"meh\" performance by Steve Miller (of whom I'm a fan), Malford Milligan and Johnny Lang do a great job with \"Brilliant Room\" and \"Texas\". My three favorite songs are:\"FatDaddy\" - an upbeat instrumental with a rock-out factor of something along the lines of \"Righteous\". The Indian flavored break and following solo are icing on the cake.\"Gem\" - Another instrumental, beautifully melodic and simple. The most soulful song on the album I think. The doubled guitar or extra reverb on some of the bends is incredibly powerful.\"Arithmetic\" - Eric's first solo vocal appearance is one of the nicest love songs I've ever heard.Aside from killer songs, the album art is perfect and funny in some places (it actually says \"Up Close\" on the cover - can you find it?).If I could choose one artist to exemplify music, Eric Johnson would be my pick (with this album in one hand and a guitar in another).\n", "val": 0.03528072312474251}

Not only in regards to his tone, but also guitar technique. The thing that is interesting, but true, with players like Johnson is they don't get better with age, in fact, I find that his playing isn't nearly as accomplished as his earlier work. Things seem to change as artists get older, they slow down a bit, but with Johnson, not only did he slow down, but his technique and tone has suffered in the process. Since \"Bloom\" his guitar tone hasn't been very appealing to me. Gone is that violin-like tone he captured in \"Ah Via Musicom\" and \"Venus Isle.\" Johnson's biggest problem is he has listened to what people have said about him and in the process has tried to nail down the essence of his sound. Once he figured this out, his tone and technique died. He hasn't done anything to ignite an interest in finding or searching for new sounds. He continues to rely on the same methods, which I think by now are as cliched as a Disney film.The songs on \"Up Close\" just didn't do much for me. I like EJ's voice and found it disappointing that he has brought in other singers like Steve Miller and Johnny Lang to sing on his songs. Also, there aren't any standout guitar melodies, improvisations, rhythms, or harmonies. He keeps stepping back and relying on the same old tricks that he used in \"Bloom,\" but the results are unsuccessful this time around.Not all of the songs are terrible.

He's one of those artists that really transcends notes and reaches a higher spiritual place with his playing.The song \"Arithmetic\" is the one that stands out the most to me. From the incredible opening run, right into one of his most beautiful melodies and lyrics since \"Bristol Shore\", the song almost seems to be talking about his love of music as much as a woman. It is breathtakingly gorgeous.\"Gem\" is another track, an instrumental in this case, that also has that wonderful feel to it. Just a beautiful composition, and one I can't wait to hear him expand on live.There is so much to talk about, as this album is just great from start to finish. I suggest you just buy it and soak in the music. EJ is a true gift to all guitarists and musicians.\n", "val": 0.0514991320669651}

They play to their strengths, have a unique, instantly-identifiable tone, write memorable, accessible melodies, and don't engage in excessive, self-indulgent \"noodling\" and experimentation that gets in the way of the song itself.  Plus, unlike most other instrumental guitar heroes who choose to occasionally sing, Johnson has a gorgeous voice, and while I'm not 100% sure what some of his lyrics are all about, the songs are still pleasant and enjoyable.

{"text": "Without doubt, no other pop singer today can touch Lara Fabian. She does not merely sing. She lives the song. She becomes the song. She is the song. Quite extraordianry, really. And her voice is developed way beyond any other singer to whom she has been compared. She is truly one of a kind.This concert in Moscow is perhaps her defining performance. This recording, however, is not the complete concert which included 19 songs and an encore (this one has 11). That's my reason for 4 stars, not 5. It is not a reflection on Fabian's talent (she deserves 10 stars!) I just want to draw attention to some merchants claiming this to be the full concert, which it is not.I have the live video recording of this concert, in its entirety, on DVD. Be weary of sellers of the video as well - some of them sell the incomplete version or even excerpts only.

{"text": "The first time I heard a song of this album was still in September last year, when a video of Mademoiselle Hyde was posted on YouTube. I fell for the song immediately, interpretation and strong at the same time sensual, sensitive performances, as she always does. The beautiful arrangement and interpretation of it, along with live performance in Latvia Festival have made me fall in love once by Lara, to the point of buying all the CDs she released from 1991 to 2010. A month later leaked to the full cd download, and it's obvious that I downloaded, while waiting for it be available for purchase. During this period I could hear all the songs, and it is indeed for me is the best of her career, the most complete in terms of music. Miss Hyde is my favorite song, Lara shows her all her beautiful voice and strong potential, in full form in its 40 years of life, and beautiful, the years have done very well to it! In December I finally received my cd, the version released in Russia, which imported to Brazil. A beautiful graphic work, sorry I have not brought the lyrics, but they are beautiful and easy to tune, so soon learn to sing them. I hope that Mademoiselle Zhivago is released worldwide because it is a beautiful project, which comes to confirm once as Lara Fabian is undoubtedly one of the best singers on earth!

{"text": "Lara Fabian is an international treasure.  There is a reason why she is loved by so many people around the world, and there is simply no one else like her.  She pours her heart into everything she does, and this is possibly the best we've seen from her.  Only Lara could find meaning in a television show like Desperate Housewives and turn that meaning into such a thoughtful and beautifully touching song.  Lara said during one of her recent concerts that the music that Igor Krutoy has composed for this album is the most beautiful music she has ever sung.  (She gives him credit but she in fact wrote the lyrics and co-wrote the music.)  The whole project was not only produced as an album but also formed the basis for a film directed by Ukrainian film producer Alan Badoev.Mademoisse Zhivago features 11 different songs in English, French, Italian, Spanish and also in Russian which are all linked to the same character.  Transcending and defying any typecast, these songs are in turn passionate, powerful, sad and sensual; and inspired by many different cultural and musical genera.  Both Lou (a song that Lara wrote for her daughter) and Mama MoR (written for her mother) are strikingly original.The CD and DVD were first released in Ukraine on the 25th of October 2010 and in Russia on the 19th of November.  The album is expected to be released in France later in 2011.  Lara introduced one of these songs in 2009 during the New Wave Festival in Letonia (Demain NExiste Pas) and last year she returned to that same stage performing new songs from the already finalized project.

{"text": "I bought this CD at the great Love Garden in Lawrence, KS in an \"impulse\" buy (pun intended).  I already own several other CDs by Gabor Szabo, and knew what to expect (can be too easy-listening at times).  It did look/feel like a serious reissue, so I decided to give it a chance.When I heard it, the very first track immediately reminded me some of record LPs like Revolver by the Beatles (1966), Little Games by the Yardbirds (1967, with Jimmy Page) and early period Grateful Dead (or just some Jerry Garcia licks?).  I figured, well it was from 1966, so just a coincidence?  Perhaps they and a lot of other great musicians from this period owned or heard this LP.  And some of them may have picked up a thing or two from it.  Or, they had common influences like Ravi Shankar, who was getting popular around this time.Gabor's music is a kind of world-beat gypsy-jazz, with subtle percussion effects.  This particular LP was during the start of the psychedelic/garage era of rock, so due to commercial pressures, would create covers of hit songs from the era, but not lame enough to be muzak.  I find it to be a relaxing and musically entertaining listen and parts of it would make a great tape to listen to during a massage.  Not lame enough to be compared among Sergio Mendes' tamer works.  Great percussion is heard throughout, courtesy of one of the greatest jazz drummers who ever lived, Mr. Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie.  Also included are Jack Gregg (bass), Bob Bushnell (guitar), and Ed Shaughnessy (tablas).The package and sound quality are first-rate, with remastering up to date; the audio quality literally sounds like they're playing in your living room (per my Cambridge Audio CD player).  The tablas sound like they're right there, the dynamic range is incredible, and there is no tape hiss or annoying noise or distortion.  In other words, about as state of the art as it gets from the period tapes, and should satisfy those with high-end audio systems.  The 30+ page booklet is huge and very informative with full session information, essays, and great photos.  Good job on this reissue of the original Impulse LP from the \"Light In The Attic\" label.This CD should interest many types of music fans.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  I even think those looking for some softer psychedelia would like it, too.  The only real clunker on this CD in my opinion is the cover of \"Paint It Black\", the Rolling Stones song.  It's a bit messy.I do agree with another reviewer that it is kind of odd they would put this much effort into a reissue of this particular LP, but the end result is worth it for those interested.  Perhaps they will do the same for a reissue of his \"Live At Monterey\" LP from 1967?Given an extra star for great packaging and audio quality.  I wish more of them were this good.\n", "val": 0.01369147002696991}
{"text": "...this is a very well-executed reissue, with a classy digipak and a HUGE booklet filled with insightful, informative notes and awesome photos. No expense was spared in the presentation of what is, to me, a quite marginal and uninteresting session. Billed as some sort of unjustly neglected nexus of jazz, pop, psych, and Indian-fusion, it really just sounds like a mildly exotic easy-listening session, with some awkward sitar fumbling and some fey, underwhelming vocals. Bernard Purdie sounds great, as he always does, but clearly this cannot be the best that Szabo has to offer...That said, while it's not an amazing listen, I do imagine that in its era it was a relatively brave thing to do. Time has not been kind to it, but there is the spark of a maverick spirit deep in its drones and grooves.Contrary to Amazon's listing, there are not extra tracks on this edition. Regardless of my feelings towards this particular session, I really admire Light in the Attic's amazing reissue program, which uphold the highest standards of audio and presentation.\n", "val": 0.009469488635659218}

{"text": "Tron: Legacy is a very belated sequel to the 1982 science fiction classic Tron, which starred Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner and introduced audiences to what were then state-of-the-art computer graphics in a story about a computer programmer named Flynn who gets sucked into his own software programme and is forced to take part in vicious gladiatorial games by the omnipotent Master Control Program. The sequel, which is directed by Joseph Kosinski, sees Flynn's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) suffer the same fate as his father, albeit 20 years later, when he receives a mysterious message from his father's old video game arcade and subsequently becomes trapped in the same digital world - which in the intervening years has become bigger, more visually stunning, and much more dangerous. With the help of a beautiful warrior named Quorra, Kevin must traverse this astonishing landscape and find a way home. The film, which stars Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen and sees both Bridges and Boxleitner reprising their original roles, is Disney's big movie for Christmas 2010, and features an original score by Daft Punk.For those unfamiliar with their history, Daft Punk is a French electronic music duo comprising composer-musicians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They first emerged as part of the French house music scene in the early 1990s and became hugely influential and successful, eventually going on to enjoy chart hits such as \"Da Funk\", \"Around the World\" and \"Harder Better Faster Stronger\". Their gimmick is that the pair of them wear stylized crash helmets and futuristic body suits on stage, giving them a sort of detached, other-worldly public persona a little like the Blue Man Group, or what Slipknot used to do in the hard rock scene. Bangalter has previous film music experience, having scored the extremely controversial French film Irrversible as a solo composer in 2002, but this is the first time Daft Punk, as a group, has scored a film.Following in the footsteps of Wendy Carlos, who scored the original Tron, Daft Punk have expanded their electronic palette to include a 90-piece symphony orchestra recorded in London. The resulting sound is immense. Many readers may be under the impression that I don't like electronic scores, but I can categorically say that this is not the case. I like electronic scores when they have a reason to be electronic, not when synthesizers are simply used to double up or (even worse) imitate on an orchestra. With its overarching themes of the human world being invaded and overtaken by its digital counterpart, Tron: Legacy has a reason to be electronic, and Daft Punk's skilful merging of the two musical palettes is one of the most engaging things about this excellent score.In terms of the stylistics of the electronic music, there's a little bit of John Carpenter, a little bit of Brad Fiedel, a little bit of Vangelis, and (obviously) a little bit of Wendy Carlos, all mashed together and filtered through Daft Punk's high energy rhythmic sensibility, but with a larger scope and a greater lyricism than any of these other pioneering electronic composers brought to their scores. There are no direct statements of any of Carlos's thematic work on the original Tron, but her fingerprints are everywhere, and I have to say that this is some of the best synth writing I have heard in a film score in years. It becomes even better when it mixes with the large-scale symphonic forces provided by the London orchestra, which humanizes and warms the electronic tones, giving them an emotional center and a great deal of power and gravitas.Many will inevitably compare this music to that of Hans Zimmer, especially his recent score for Inception (listen to \"Recognizer\"), but while the orchestral tones are similar in their chord progressions and rhythmic ideas, the electronics have a sophistication way beyond anything anyone from Remote Control has shown to date. The multiplicity of tones, sample types, and nostalgic throwbacks to the synth sounds of the 1980s give the electronic parts of Tron: Legacy a depth and variety almost never heard in scores of this type. Whereas Zimmer and company often limit the scope of their electronic palette, Daft Punk opens theirs up to encompass a massive range.The opening \"Overture\" introduces the main theme of the film, a heroic piece which has a vague similarity to Aaron Copland's classic piece Fanfare for the Common Man. \"The Grid\" features some stirring and dramatic narration by Jeff Bridges (the only cue to do so), which builds to an alien-sounding but wonderfully effective statement of the main theme. In the score's conclusive cues - \"C.L.U\", \"Flynn Lives\" and the \"Finale\" - the theme reaches appropriately epic proportions, while in the \"End Titles\" cue the theme is accompanied by a modern, driving, defiantly upbeat electronic accompaniment which is simply terrific. There is even room for a conventionally attractive classical love theme, \"Adagio for Tron\", which features an absolutely gorgeous cello solo, before going on to pick up a bubbling electronic undercurrent during its second half.The action music is busy and powerful, with thunderous cues like \"Rinzler\", \"The Game Has Changed\", \"Fall\" and \"Disc Wars\" building layer upon layer of propulsive electronic sound design and booming percussion hits over a bed of churning, endlessly moving string lines. \"Outlands\" has a terrific Don Davis-style fading brass effect towards the end of the cue, while \"Rectifier\" has portentous horn blasts and an ominous, I'm-coming-to-get-you string figure which sounds more like something Elliot Goldenthal would write, and has a wonderful, palpable sense of danger. The moments of pure electronica - \"The Son of Flynn\", \"Armory\", the Terminator-like \"Arena\", the groovy \"End of Line\", the aggressive and highly-charged \"Derezzed\", the unexpectedly graceful \"Solar Sailer\" - are fascinating, and often have a mesmerizing dream-like ambience which is astonishingly effective. Some of these cues have the same hypnotic, euphoric aura that 1990s trance music had, which makes perfect sense considering Bangalter and Homem-Christo's respective backgrounds.Knowing me and my tastes, Tron: Legacy is the last score you would expect me to praise, but there's something about Daft Punk's music here which is immensely engaging and interesting. Maybe it's the sense of freedom and lack of cynicism that composers new to film music always seem to have, being let loose in an exciting new world. Maybe it's their total commitment to the project, and their obvious thrill at being able to incorporate an orchestra into their music for the first time which makes things so appealing. Their electronic sound design is so fresh and lively when compared to the tired old samples we have grown accustomed to hearing over the last few years. And while their orchestral writing is certainly not groundbreaking in any way, it has a pleasing tonality and an appropriately grand scale which makes it very easy to enjoy. It's unlikely to win any awards, but in this case it really doesn't matter: this is one of my favorite scores of the year, and I'm as surprised to be typing that line as I'm sure you are to be reading it.\n", "val": 0.02830495871603489}

It also does not include the two retro 80's songs \"Separate Ways (World's Apart)\" by Journey and the Eurythmic's \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\" that were both featured in Flynn's Arcade.As for the score itself, it's absolutely mind-blowing.  Daft Punk have created a sonic masterpiece worthy of the legacy of Tron.  Their brilliant layering of ambient electronica with orchestral symphonics is every bit as avant garde in creating atmospheric digital soundscapes as Wendy Carlos' score was for the original Tron.  I only wish that they had incorporated some more of Wendy's memorable themes.  You can kind of hear a few familiar notes that recalls Tron's theme in \"Adagio For Tron\" but that's pretty much the only hat tip to Wendy's vintage score.  Like the film itself, Daft Punk have taken the music of Tron to a whole new aesthetic level by incorporating their unique style of techno synthpop along with their influences of electronic film composers like Vangelis on \"Arrival\" to the ominous Carpenter-esque  \"C.L.U.\" and synthesizing them with traditional orchestral composers like Bernard Hermann and Max Steiner.Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homen-Christo demonstrate they have the musical talents to command the accompaniment of a full symphony orchestra and can score unforgettable music for blockbuster films.  When I heard Daft Punk were scoring the film, I admit I initially had my doubts that they could pull it off but they have and by far their score for Tron Legacy is one of the best and most inspirationally thrilling movie soundtracks of the modern age and deserves a complete 2-disc release and not scattered all over the Grid.End of Line\n", "val": 7.268835906870663e-05}

I like my vinyl collection because the sound feels.... \"richer\" out of my system than it does when I have my computer hooked up to it. The bass feels deeper, the vocals and instrumentation sounds more present, etc. There's that stereotypical \"to me, it just sounds better on vinyl.\" I put this one on the table the instant I got home and opened it and was expecting that \"sound\" like I would get from my copy of Nine Inch Nail's Halo 14 or my Explosions in the Sky Take Care. But this one sounded no better than if I were streaming a low bitrate version of it off of youtube. I was just disappointed with the sound and yes, I did compare it with some of my other albums. Even the $16 copy of Imagine Dragons (well known for sounding pretty awful on vinyl, go look at it's reviews and you'll see what I mean) sounded more impressive than this one.

Sorry} The soundtrack itself is very good, if {very} mildly generic sounding. Though, you leave with the impression that no one but Daft Punk could've made it. Synthesizers are used sparingly and appropriately, but still with their sense of timing and melodic minimalism. The pressing is, bearing in mind that pops decrease after the first play, dead quiet, very full, and sounds about exactly as one would want it to. The packaging, to, is very good. The sleeve appears to be soft-touch, with good sharpness. Included liner note sheet is always appreciated. The glow-in-the-dark sleeve - kept from the first pressing - glows well, and did so after 'charging' for an hour in a reasonably luke-bright room. The lack of a download is fine personally, but to be kept in mind.

{"text": "The Track ListThis review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:OvertureThe GridFather and SonThe Son of FlynnEncom Part IEncom Part IIRecognizerArmoryArenaRound OneRinzlerThe Game Has ChangedOutlandsFather and SonAdagio For TronNocturneOutlands, Part IIReflectionsEnd Of LineCastorDerezzedFallSea of SimulationRectifierDisc WarsC.L.U.ArrivalFlynn LivesSunrise PreludeTron Legacy (End Titles)Solar SailerFinaleThe PiecesOverture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.The Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.Father and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.The Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.Encom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.Recognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.Armory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.Arena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.The Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.Outlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.Adagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.Nocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.Reflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.End of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best \"Daft-Punk style\" track on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.Fall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this track as it distracts from the main musical theme played.Sea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.Rectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good track if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.Disc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.C.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.Arrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.Flynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.Sunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.The ScoreTron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.Too Many Adagios?It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest AchievementWhen I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.Special note on the LP edition of the score:This is the most complete version of the score available to my knowledge. While the tracks are not in chronological order, there is only one track missing. Ironically it is one of my favorite tracks and the one I listen to the most, Father and Son. This is especially irritating as this is a Disney album and Disney and Apple are very close partners, yet this is an iTunes exclusive track. Its absence is absolutely idiotic in this otherwise complete album.Also, the beautiful album notes on a sheet of paper inside of the album rather than on the record sleeves, and there is no digital download or other extras included with this LP.Musically, the LP version of this album is practically identical to the MP3/CD release versions, however the digital and orchestral parts of the soundtrack blend together slightly better (the digital sounds are less sharp), and the bass is greatly reduced. The bass from the MP3 shakes the foundations when I play the Overture, but is nearly unnoticeable on the LP. I own both and consider both an essential purchase.\n", "val": 0.0197910126298666}

I first heard some of the tracks from my Pandora radio station, so there was a good chance I was going to like the album. I bought the MP3 version from Amazon and was quite pleased with the album. First of all I am not a follower of Daft Punk and did not know that much about their music. As a stand alone move score album I really do like the album. There is a lot off really good tracks and some that I just crank up. So if you like this style of music I would recommend you give it a try, listen to the clips on the Amazon site which should give you a very good idea if you will like this album or not. As I said earlier music is so subjective, it really boils down to personal taste. As a side note, I also like Two Steps from Hell, which is another score composer, that sorta tells you my taste in music.\n", "val": 0.000901153776794672}

This time, back to write one my favorite scores ever in the last ten years!!!!Daft Punk's TRON: LEGACY came as a complete surprise to me because I had no idea who they were and what kind of music they played.  What they bring us here is one of the catchiest main themes ever and a score full of wonderful ideas and motives that impresses me a lot every time I play it.  When the \"Overture\" presents the main theme in its grandeur, one is in for an incredible ride.  \"The Grid\" has Jeff Bridges' voice that segues into the main theme...wow!!!!  That is impressive!!!  All the tracks are magnificent.  \"Adagio For TRON\" is extremely sublime, and the percussions heard on \"Recognizer\", \"Arena\", and \"Rinzler\" are very impressive.  And it's equally impressive that the duo counted with the support of Bruce Broughton and Hans Zimmer for the creation of this composition.I got the iTunes version of the score, but a cousin of mine managed to get me the tracks from the Deluxe Edition.  In general, Daft Punk's work here is magnificent!!!  Highly recommended!!!\n", "val": 0.04777780920267105}

I love how the movie plays almost like a long music video with this soundtrack as the main star. Really this is Daft Punk's greatest work and better than the movie itself. It blends symphonic tracks like \"Nocturne\" that sound like something a modern Beethoven could have written with dirty synth tracks like \"End of Line\" that sounds more like what an artificial intelligence would jam out to while making lil baby programs. That is fantastically dynamic stuff! What other album gives you a pure experience that plays like a movie, pulls with emotionally weighty tracks, and gets down and dirty with dance tunes that would be at home in tha club lol. Of all the jams I crank through my home system, some of these tracks get cranked the LOUDEST! Dirty synths, broodingly low baselines, and edgy dancehall riffs.

{"text": "Man, I love this score! While Tron: Legacy wasn't as great a movie as you would hope story-wise, two things this movie gets 100% right are its visuals and, the reason you're reading this, the score! Daft Punk hits it out of the park with his musical score here. The only complaint I have about this product is that the first track you hear in the movie (the one that plays over the main titles) also contains some of the dialogue from the film over the music. I bought this CD mainly to hear this track in its entirety... WITHOUT anyone speaking over it! The good news is the rest of the score doesn't contain any unwanted voice over. But if you wish to hear that bad ass guitar riff you heard in the movie just as the title came up like I did, you'll have to whether through Jeff Bridges' words to hear it. I give the score a 5 out of 5, but the CD a 4. Great tracks, just wish I could have heard my favorite one dialogue free...\n", "val": 0.0034407766070216894}

Even some of the most memorable film tunes are buried in 2 hours of easily forgettable functional music, which is why I only own a handful of soundtracks.  Daft Punk's score of Tron: Legacy, however, is a score filled with one memorable tune after another.  You can tell that I'm not the only one who feels this way given its enormous critical acclaim; the amount of positive reviews on Amazon and iTunes; and the fact that other films/shows have used the music in their own promotional material (Game of Thrones used \"The Game Has Changed\" in a preview of their third season and \"Recognizer\" was used in a trailer for one of the recent Resident Evil movies).\"The Son of Flynn\", \"Recognizer\", The Game Has Changed\", \"Outlands\", \"End of Line\", \"Disc Wars\", \"C.L.U.\", and \"Tron Legacy (End Titles)\" are definitely worth mentioning and Daft Punk fans will certainly like, \"Derezzled\" even though it is very short.I definitely recommend this album.\n", "val": 0.011618869379162788}

{"text": "The soundtrack to Tron: Legacy is a brilliant achievement for electronic music duo Daft Punk. The duo, known for their house and technopop productions, collaborated with music supervisor Jason Bentley and orchestrator Joseph Trapanese to create a score that merged orchestral music with electronic music. Their product is a brilliant soundtrack that marks a significant place in electronic music history.  The idea of merging orchestral music and electronic music has been popular for many years, but Tron: Legacy is by far one of the most successful attempts at this endeavor. For starters, the soundtrack is entertaining. It is an intense and enjoyable listen. Secondly, the score truly captures the tone and essence of the film. The piece mirrors the intensity, drama, and suspense expressed throughout the film. The movie takes place primarily in a futuristic, digital world. The piece sounds out-of-this-world and original without sounding like the clich computer sounding music heard in many movies that surround around a futuristic or technology heavy theme. In addition to creating a good soundtrack, Daft Punk's achievements with Tron: Legacy include their seamless fusion of electronic music with Trapanese's orchestral score. Rather than sounding choppy, the two different styles of music compliment each other. In \"Solar Sailer,\" synthesized tones and sequencers can be heard while a chorus of violins beautifully fills the background.\"The Game Has Changed\" serves as another example of a great mixture of orchestral music and electronic music. Sequencers and granulized sound come in and out to compliment the music of the orchestra that's playing the meat of the song. At times, the orchestral music is distorted by technological means, adding a sense of suspense and to the song and continuing the digital theme present throughout the soundtrack and the film.Throughout a listen of the entire soundtrack, one can hear everything from orchestral horns and violins to synthesized pianos and other computer sounds that can't truly be described by relation to a real instrument. Overall, the soundtrack is more orchestral music with subtle electronic lines in it, a fact that seems to displease many fans.Daft Punk has been criticized for Tron: Legacy. Many fans miss Daft Punks old style (which can appropriately be described as creating new style) and accuse the duo of \"selling out.\" Listeners need to remember that this soundtrack is meant to be just that, a soundtrack. The score to a soundtrack of a film is not going to be the same as the music on an album that is meant to be listened to independently. A film's soundtrack is not going to sound like Daft Punk's famed Discover album. Daft Punk made a piece that follows the style of a film score because it is a film score and must operate in that capacity. With that being said, the piece is still quite original and their willingness to so close integrate electronic music with orchestral music is quite progressive and far from \"selling out.\"Individuals like Iannis Xenakis, Robert Moog, and Max Mathews would be delighted to see the essential role that electronic music made in Tron: Legacy. Involvement of computer music in film has travelled a long way from \"Daisy Bell\" in 2001: A Space Odyssey and the trautonium in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Integrating synthesizers, sequencers, modulators, and other technological instruments with classical orchestral performers is no easy tasks, but Daft Punk executed it successfully. The duo should be applauded for their progressive, daring, and successful efforts.\n", "val": 0.028001561760902405}
{"text": "Where to begin? Admittedly, this soundtrack is intricately composed - beyond my limited musical understanding; however, I like to think that I possess a keen ear for quality music and a passionate appreciation for film, so that will have to suffice in my recommendation of this album.The well-established French electronic music duo known as Daft Punk has captured the hearts and ears of electronic music enthusiasts since the early 90s. As the main composers of the Tron Legacy soundtrack, the duo set aside a couple years of their career to concentrate on mastering this album, which features a 100-piece orchestra from London. With that being said, it was a no brainer for me to take an hour out of my day to pleasure my ears with this brilliant musical score. The soundtrack certainly goes against Daft Punk's traditional style of composition, fleeing from their typical house music feel to a more theatrical, synth-heavy approach accompanied by the talented orchestra.My personal experience with Tron: Legacy began about a month before the highly anticipated film hit theaters when I stumbled across a \"leak\" of the soundtrack online. With Daft Punk as the featured composer of the soundtrack, I knew I could not go wrong with giving it a listen. Right off the bat, the classical music approach is presented by \"Overture\" and then \"The Grid,\" both of which sooth the listener over with epically long build-ups. In \"The Grid,\" one of the only tracks on the albums that has vocals, Daft Punk uses a powerful quote by Flynn (\"And then, one day...I got in\") to maintain its slow and deliberate introduction of the plot. After the two introductory songs end, Daft Punk hits you with a trippy, fast-paced motorcycle ride through the city with Flynn's son, the protagonist of the film, with the song that is conveniently called \"The Son of Flynn.\" In theaters, this was the first scene where the audience really experienced the full effect of the 3D experience so it really got my adrenaline pumping. The beginning of the song is probably my favorite beat of the entire soundtrack.After a few tracks into the album, I began to notice how well Daft Punk managed to transition from song to song. From gradual to being caught off guard by abrupt endings, the album flows smoothly and always delivers a theatrical feel, no matter speed at which it makes your head bob. The pauses between tracks really enhance the mood of the soundtrack, really sending you on an up and down roller coaster ride of emotion as the tension gradually builds. We finally reach the climax of the film during \"Flynn Lives,\" which is unbelievably well-composed.\"TRON Legacy\" was a typical song to be playing during the credits scene at the end. As someone who places high importance on having a quality finale song, I was not impressed; I did not even really enjoy the tune. With that being said, this was the main flaw I could pick out with the soundtrack.Overall, I thought Daft Punk did a brilliant job composing an original score that ultimately enhanced my complete experience with Tron Legacy. I would strongly recommend listening to the album before watching the film; doing so will give you time to enjoy a masterful technosonic adventure unfold through your headphones before you are able to match the exciting visual experience with the sounds. You know how people always say, \"the book was sooo much better than the movie?\" I guess that is what I am trying to say about this soundtrack in comparison to the film. I say check it out for sure.\n", "val": 0.015218483284115791}
{"text": "Daft Punk, the French duo of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, has been known for its electrifying dance music.  In a small bedroom with only a couple of synthesizers and a drum machine, Daft Punk has created hits such as \"Harder Better Faster Stronger\" and \"Around the World\".  In 2010, the duo forayed into the world of film with the debut of TRON: Legacy.  This film score was groundbreaking in many ways, so much so that it has created a whole new genre of music, namely movie music that can stand on its own.  Daft Punk achieved this feat by creating new types of music than they had originally made, creating a new type of film score than originally accompanied presentations on the big screen, and creating a new way to mesh together multiple genres of music.  One of the ways Daft Punk is pioneering a whole new genre of music is by being innovative with the type of music they create.  Though Bangalter made the score to the 2002 French film Irreversible and though the duo has made the film Electroma together, the TRON: Legacy soundtrack is definitely not like anything Daft Punk has created before.  Though this may disappoint dedicated Daft Punk fans, the product they have created is quite compelling.  Instead of catchy dance floor hits, Bangalter and Homem-Christo worked with a 90-piece orchestra to create a beautifully dark and melancholy film score.  When interviewed by Dazed and Confused Magazine in December 2010, Bangalter commented, \"This project is by far the most challenging and complex thing we have ever been involved with.  Coming from our background of making electronic music in a small bedroom, and ending up having our music performed by a 90-piece orchestra... recording this orchestra was a very intense experience\".  The soundtrack is very orchestra-heavy, a very large step away from Daft Punk's music of the past.  Though the album does contain some dance tunes more similar to Daft Punk's usual fare like \"End of Line\" and \"Derezzed\", there is quite a mix of classical and electric music.  Unlike many of their previous projects, there are no vocals (minus one track with Jeff Bridges speaking about the plotline of the movie) over the music.  Also, many of Daft Punk's earlier pieces were rather upbeat and quick-paced.  TRON's soundtrack provides a stark contrast.  The score has many driving rhythms and melodies, but it has a very dark and ominous sound (as can be heard in sounds like \"Arena\" and \"The Game Has Changed\").  Over all, Daft Punk stretched their creative music style to craft the TRON soundtrack and, in doing to, helped to create a new type of movie music.  Another reason this soundtrack is opening up a whole new genre of music is by changing the way movie music is thought about.  Needless to say, electronic music and classical music have been used in tandem before, notably in the soundtrack for the original 1982 TRON composed by Wendy Carlos (known for Switched-On Bach, a Moog-synthesized version of Bach pieces).  This soundtrack used both a Moog and digital synthesizers and featured the London Philharmonic Orchestra.  This marriage was not quite successful (Carlos ended up replacing the orchestra recording with digitally synthesized versions). Daft Punk used Wendy Carlos' original score as inspiration when they were asked to create the music for TRON: Legacy.  The director of TRON: Legacy, John Kosinski, knew that Daft Punk had the necessary skills to create the score for his movie.  He knew they were \"more than just dance guys... There's a lot going on behind those masks\".  Though some of the songs on the soundtrack do resemble those off a classic film score (such as \"Overture\" and \"Finale\"), the majority of the album sounds starkly different from any other soundtrack out there.  Daft Punk used synthesizers to create driving rhythms and melodies in songs like \"Arena\", \"Rinzler\", and \"Derezzed\".  The music is loud and powerful, not meant to sit in the background like normal film scores.  When the final mix was made at Skywalker Ranch in Northern California, the mixers said it was \"the loudest film [they'd] ever mixed\".  Unlike normal film scores that are usually made after the movie is complete, TRON: Legacy was made to go with the music.  Due to all of these factors, the TRON: Legacy soundtrack is a very different type of film score.  Finally, Daft Punk was innovative in creating the TRON soundtrack by more closely meshing classical and electronic music.  Bangalter has noted that \"In the past, [Daft Punk] has worked with clashing genres like disco and heavy metal, and here [in TRON] [they] would do it with film scores... this idea of the ultimate retro-futurism\".  This combination can be seen throughout the album.  Numerous themes in the film score are repeated in several different songs (including Wendy Carlos' original theme!), many times in both electronic and orchestral instruments.  At some points, the listener cannot even distinguish between when melodies and harmonies are being played by electronic or acoustic instruments.  By successfully meshing classical and electronic music, Daft Punk has created a very listener-friendly type of movie music.  This music is so listener-friendly that, unlike many other scores, it can be listened to and enjoyed outside the context of the movie theater.  Daft Punk's TRON soundtrack is a new and exciting piece of technosonic art.  New techniques for Daft Punk, for film music, and for the combination of classical and electronic music have helped the TRON: Legacy soundtrack to create a new genre of stand-alone movie music.  In many minds, this soundtrack is one of the greatest ever produced.  Thank goodness director Joseph Kosinski went to Daft Punk to create the soundtrack to this movie.  No doubt a traditional soundtrack would have done the job, but Daft Punk's version has reinvented what a movie score should be.\n", "val": 0.023423824459314346}

{"text": "Most of the quality of the soundtrack is on the level of dreamy/reverberant synth/orchestral sound design and their intelligent blending.There are a lot of repeated synth-note pulses, emotion-laden chord sequences, broad hymn-lines with added noises from orchestral percussion/taiko drums, slow moving textures with occasional dramatic buildups.However, compared to the rich quirkiness of the original TRON soundtrack, the musical substance of Daft Punk's production collapses to almost nothing, especially on repeated listenings.Don't get me wrong, I really like Daft Punk as such and the comparison to Wendy Carlos is of course unfair, but after listening to this for a while, I realized that this soundtrack might in fact be a major reason for the lack of emotional connection I had to the film.Things oscillate between aggressive/menacing/overwhelming pulsation and tragic/melancholic darkness. The overall attitude of this soundtrack seems to be a \"trancing out\" of emotions. Instead of the perceptual shocks and high density of surprise elements that drove the original TRON over the brink of incoherence, we are now made to relax and accept everything as if in a subdued emptied state of hypnosis generated by repetitive patterns.The new movie felt like it wanted to tell a story of great depth, but in the end everything appeared strangely flat and permeated with things I seemed to have seen 1000 times before.I was wondering if an aspect of this experience was due to the fact that emotional or dynamic detail or cognitively uplifting accents are blanketed under the language of comparably glacial musical minimalism throughout this soundtrack.Definitely not in the legacy of the original, but it's of course also a matter of taste.As a music lover, I could in any case not get myself as excited about it as many other reviewers on here.The TRON adagio made me sigh.... \"Oh Tron! Where did all your gladiatorial fruitiness go!\" :)\n", "val": 6.91545064910315e-05}

{"text": "When the news broke a few years ago that non other than electronic music legends Daft Punk were going to score the music for the \"Tron\" 2010 reboot, it raised a lot of expectations among Daft Punk fans.\"Tron: Legacy\" (22 tracks; 59 min.) starts off with the \"Overture\" (of course), followed by \"The Grid\", the only spoken-piece on this (featuring Jeff Bridges). But shortly after that, we are into a full-blown symphonic soundtrack, in which the electronic music is kept to a minimum (but for a few exceptions, more on that later). The general tone of the soundtrack is quite dark and threatening and the London Orchestra shines throughout. It culminates for me in tracks 9 \"Outlands\", with fantasic orchestral interplay, and 10 \"Adagio for Tron\", featuring a beautifully pensive orchestra. The \"true\" Daft Punk sound only comes in a couple of tracks from the nightclub scene in the movie (and in which the guys from Daft Punk make a hilarious brief appearance--when I saw it for the first time, I blurted out to myself \"OMG, there's Daft Punk!\").In all, I quite enjoy this soundtrack more than I expected, but then again I love classical music and symphonic movie soundtracks. I have to say that I have been bewildered by the praise from many Daft Punk fans for this release, as this truly has nothing to do with the \"usual\" Daft Punk music, but to which I can only say that there are lots of other worthy symphonic soundtracks out there worth checking out, if that is really your thing. For the Daft Punk fans who want the \"true\" Daft Punk sound, check out instead the \"Tron: Legacy Reconfigured\" album. Last but not least, a shoutout to my son, who bought this for me as a gift some time ago, for no reason (other than knowing I would like this), just because he felt like it.

That one segment of the movie totally blew me away musically and I had to have the soundtrack before anything else. I bought mine from iTunes so I got the 2 extra tracks and I have played this album looped over and over for days. Only problem is, I wish it were longer. Some of the tracks could easily be extended and as much as I enjoy the R3C0NF1GUR3D album, it's not a true remix of all the tracks.I love the classical/electronic combinations and DP delivers a truly genius mix here. Considering that this is Disney (yuck), I am pleasantly surprised that it's this good. The credit I believe is owing to DP and their penchant for having a tight creative control over their sound. Disney is notorious for being master control freaks, so one wonders how much was actually given/taken in this partnership. Aside from that, I love how this work feels timeless. It seems to incorporate a feel from the first movie (which I have seen) as well as something that feels \"today\". The beauty of it all is that in 20 years, it will still be an excellent album to listen to...I only wish that there were more albums like this...like maybe they could write a soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist.

When I hear this music it reminds me of specific scenes from the movie, and when I watch the movie, I really hear and feel the mood the music is trying to portray.  To me this is just what a sound track should accomplish.  I was very disappointed to discover that this sound track wasn't nominated for an oscar.  I really enjoy listening to this sound track.  The dark electronic sounds are very cool, and it's very easy to visualize the scenes from the movie as I listen to each track.  There is one track, Rectifier, that sounds exactly like music from Gladiator; it's very easy to pick out.  I also wish the tracks were in order with how they were used in the movie; they're close, but there are some differences.

{"text": "Tron:Legacy may not have pleased every movie fan. And Daft Punk's score let down a few of their fans. But if you(like me) love film scores, I have to say this one keeps getting better the more I hear it.Their use of strings is some of the best we've gotten from the recent crop of new film composers, but the album still retains their signature electronic mastery.There are hints of vintage Herrmann in here. Plus a little nod to Blade Runner. This is a great first score for Daft Punk.The 2CD set(which I bought here on Amazon), is a nice addition to any collection. The 2nd disc, however, is rather short, with only 5 extra tracks. The addition of 'Castor' is great.  The best stuff is to be found on the 1st disc, which is exactly the same as the American version. This CD isn't tinted black and the cover is not glossy.Overall, I would say the Special Edition is not necessary(it is rather expensive), unless you've got to have it all.Hope to see an Ultimate Edition someday.\n", "val": 0.014943486079573631}
{"text": "Despite what I thought about the movie itself, one thing Tron: Legacy definitely had going for it was the soundtrack. Every review for the movie praised the soundtrack by Daft Punk, and once I finally watched it, I was in the same boat. Chances are, if you're on this page reading through reviews, you either already know how good it is, or are curious about the hype. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack has a lot more music on it than I expected, doesn't cost much, and is one of those soundtracks I know I'll be listening to for months, maybe even years, to come. There are only two minor complaints I have with it, one of which is covered in a spotlight review extensively, and that's the fact that this isn't the whole soundtrack. If you want everything, you'll either have to import the two cd set, or get this version from Amazon and hunt for the additional tracks.What is there to be said about this soundtrack that hasn't been said already? Daft Punk did an incredible job making modern electronic music that has a heavy 80s sound without being outdated, as well as making some nice semi-classical pieces. A few tracks on here reminded me of music from the first Terminator movie, and that was a pleasant surprise. The two standout tracks here are Derezzed and End of Line (that's the one that actually made me want the soundtrack once I heard it in the movie), but my other personal favorites are:-The Son of Flynn-Rinzler-The Game Has Changed-Fall-Solar Sailer-Flynn Lives-TRON Legacy (End Titles)As for my other complaint, it's that a good number of tracks on here borrow from eachother a little too much. Fall is reused in C.L.U., and the main theme is used quite a few times, to the point where I had to look at my iPod to make sure I hadn't accidentally set anything to repeat or random. Luckily, the music that's reused isn't bad, so I can deal with it, but others might not feel the same.If you haven't heard the music in the movie yet, go give a few of the tracks mentioned a listen and see if you like it. If you have seen the movie and are still on the fence, what are you waiting for?\n", "val": 8.495375368511304e-05}

For me, it joins the ranks of Goldenthal's Alien 3, Pouledoris' Conan The Barbarian, Vangelis' Cosmos, Toto's Dune, Kilar's Bram Stoker's Dracula and Goldsmith's Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  In many cases, as with TRON: Legacy, I'd say the soundtracks are better than the movies they accompany.  When I first saw the trailers for TRON: Legacy, the music appealed to me, but I figured that was just trailer music.  When I saw the movie, I was pleased by the music but more involved in the movie.  But when I finally listened to the soundtrack alone, I enjoyed it even more.  Almost as if the movie lessened my enjoyment of the music.  Definitely a rare treat.As for Amazon's soundtrack not being complete - that's true, but I don't know of any one place you can get the entire soundtrack.  I've managed to piece together a 31-track version from digging around the Internet, adding 9 tracks to the one I bought from Amazon.

The 22 tracks, done in classical orchestra backing with the electronica of Daft Punk give a powerful fullness to the music, somewhat similar to the volumous magic of the Star Wars instrumentation and effect, only better!  It gives you a feeling of magnitude, as if you were sometimes floating in space, looking down on planet Earth.  The synthesization is magnificent.  It is a futuristic-type score that is often heart-thumping and driving.As much as I love music, I was so \"into\" the movie when I saw it in the theater, I was not even consciously aware of the music.  Now that I listen to it separately, I wonder why not.  Obviously, the music and film were perfectly blended.  In other words, I was affected by the music without even realizing it.This is not party music, but something you would play while you are either consciously relaxing and listening to it, or going about your business in the house (cleaning, in your workshop, whatever).  Sometimes it's slow and spacey; sometimes it is driving and thumping. The booming base is awesome.  If you play it in the car, don't blame me if you get a speeding ticket!

{"text": "It's nice to hear a different take on the recent practice of mixing synthesized sounds with acoustic sounds.  Unlike many film composers who use synthesizers pretending to be acoustic instruments (looking at YOU, Hans Zimmer), Daft Punk employed physical orchestral players to accompany (and sometimes replace) their synthesized works.  In many of the tracks, the minimalist \"loops\" aren't really loops at all, but actual string performers playing the lines over and over while the brass players blast out thick chords and the percussion hammer out repeated patterns.  I don't know Daft Punk's work, but I like this album.Side note: In the loud section of \"C.L.U.\" (around 2:00), listen for the sustained rattle below the drum beat.  I can't tell for certain, but it sounds like a bass trombone hitting a pedal tone VERY, VERY LOUD (hell yeah), except that it's held for 24 measures- without even the slightest waver in the cycles/second (which also indicates that it's not two trombone players trading off).  My guess is that Daft Punk sampled the bass trombone's pedal note and then looped it; there's no human that can sustain a fortissimo pedal tone for that long.  If I'm right, then kudos to them!\n", "val": 0.007404338102787733}

{"text": "When I saw the first trailer for TRON: Legacy at the beginning of the year I was immediately impressed by the music in it. I then learned the music was indeed the score and then I learned the score was being composed by the French electronic group Daft Punk. Daft Punk is comprised of the duo that is Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel De Homem-Christo. It's not an unusual sight to see artists from the popular music world foraying into films. In fact almost every great composer came from that background.So, what was the task at hand here with TRON: Legacy? It was a huge one let me tell you that. Daft Punk had to follow what Wendy Carlos did with the original film. Wendy Carlos is considered to be the mother (or father depending on what time you're talking about) of electronic music. Her score to A Clockwork Orange was revolutionary in a way never thought possible. A decade later she brought her style to TRON. Now fast forward 28 years to today. Daft Punk has delivered a mesmerizing electronic/orchestral experience that carries the spirit of TRON and will blow you away.The score is crafted and structured almost perfectly and never wanders or loses focus. The soundscape is a world on its own for the most part. The \"Overture\" introduces us to the grand theme of the film. The music has an echoing of the brilliant electronic scores of the 70's and 80's. Blade Runner by Vangelis was one that jumped to mind. Now let's talk about that soundscape. Like I said for the most part this score has an identity all of its own. However, there are moments where it slips heavily into the Hans Zimmer realm. Many people are calling it an Inception clone. Is it? Not really. The score does have signature Hans Zimmer elements in it. The score was mixed at Hans Zimmer's studio and the composers do thank Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell in the liner notes of the CD. So it is possible that some of those stylings could have rubbed off on Daft Punk, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Is it a Hans Zimmer score though? Not at all. The style and approach are very unique in their own respect.The sounds are grand and vivid just as the visuals are. There is a wondrous enormity to the sound of the whole score. It fills the space from wall to wall with terrific simple melodies. I always say simpler is better. The simpler the sound the larger the emotional effect is. The CD is also expertly arranged. The way the score opens, progresses and closes with a reprisal of the themes is fantastic. \"Flynn Lives\" is quite the track let me tell you and will give you goosebumps. Throughout the whole experience the score swells up and down to create waves of intense and emotionally driven music. It was a fantastic ride and TRON: Legacy is definitely one of the better scores of the year.\n", "val": 0.02159407176077366}

There's no shortage of reasons to enjoy this album.If you like Daft Punk, you'll like this album, because it's some of the best of what they do. If you liked the movie, you'll like this album, because as with any score, you can close your eyes and find yourself in the middle of a particularly memorable scene, just by listening to the music. If you liked the 1980s, this--well, I'll put it the way I put it when a friend asked me about it: It's like the 1980s, as a whole, had indecent relations with the London Symphony Orchestra, and it was glorious.While some scores rely on a variety of themes and recurring melodies to produce a varied effect, the score for Tron Legacy has perhaps three recurring melodies at most, and a trained ear can pick them out in an instant. However, Daft Punk did something far more interesting, which I believe provides another reason to give this album at least a once-over. Every time a theme is revisited, one can hear a change in the very texture of the sound, lending more depth than a simple change in pace or key can do on its own.tl;dr: A very unique soundtrack.

There was a lot of action, danger, meditation, thoughtfullnes and even some good emotions with the adigo track. I enjoyed the solar sailor track very much, very 'traveling' in many ways. The action and danger in the early scenes was well imparted in the music and Disc Wars, you can tell some serious butt kicking going on. What I enjoyed most about this is that the way the two genres of music came together so very well and so thoughtfully. I was a bit peved that is is only a partial realease but sufficeint to get a very good idea of the music in the movie. Frontier was a very good track, I mean you can almost picute moving and movement in a dramatic way. If you love classical music, this is something to consider, if you like techno they have that even a chill dance trac from the 'club' the characters visited, this is something to consider. So overall I enjoyed the trac, it was short on plenty of them but then again you don't always need long tracs. if you want a unique experience in soundtracks this is something I would consider seriously as a download and the digital booklet with it offers some intersting insights that really add to the overall experience of this work.

{"text": "The film was cut to the music. That should give a hint right there of just how well the music and the film flowed together, and how easily the images accompanying the music in the film pop into your head while listening to this soundtrack. Combining authentic symphonic work with layers of electronic music, the soundtrack to \"Tron: Legacy\" is an incredible piece of soundtrack artwork that deserves at least an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score.From the get-go of Jeff Bridges's voice narrating in the track \"The Grid\" right up through the \"End Titles\" track, this soundtrack never ceases to amaze. For me, there is not a single track on here I don't care much for, though there are some big standouts, such as \"The Game Has Changed\", a track that was done so well that listening to it brings back the images of the much-too-short Lightcycle battle of the film. There is \"Armory\", in which you can practically hear the steps of the Sirens as they rig Sam up for the arena games. And then there is \"The Son of Flynn\", a track that can only really be described as \"felt\" rather than \"heard\". Leitmotifs run rampant here, from the primal rumble of Clu's motif to the notes that show up in the \"The Grid\", sprinkled throughout such tracks as \"Armory\", \"Flynn Lives\", and \"Recognizer\". They serve to tie the entire work together without overshadowing the tracks themselves.It is a deep disappointment that the bonus tracks of overseas releases, such as \"Encom, Parts I & II\" and \"Castor\" are no included on the physical release, or the Amazon exclusive track \"Sea of Simulation\".

{"text": "The Tron soundtrack is leaps and bounds better than the actual movie for which it was scored. Daft Punk is at their best and does an exceptional job holding the line, moving effortlessly from one track to the next. Haunting, ethereal, and all around mood music, the ambience created is no less than what the movie failed to deliver. It reminds me a bit of the original Escape from New York by John Carpenter.Let's be honest, Tron was cool when you were 7 years old. Now older and a little wiser, it's easy to see how ridiculous the script is. Take for example Jeff Bridge's droning voiceover in Tron: Legacy explaining the circuitry of the grid as something taking the shape of ships and motorcycles, and you start realize just exactly what's wrong with this picture. In the 1980s, Tron worked because video games were still on the verge of breaking through and the theme of computers and circuitry were something of a mystery to most lay people in the 1980s. This unabashed romanticism and futurism could be forgiven then. It was something you could get away with. But given the rate at which we've progressed, technological advancement seems to take the steam out of such a movie. It would be like trying to remake H.G. Wells' vision of the moon in his book The First Men on the Moon (1901). Today, we know the moon fairly well, and because of this, its mystery died a death tantamount to the rate in which our knowledge of the lunar environment increased.Other themes still work. Aliens are yet to be discovered. The question of God is very much alive. But little electrified people living in computer circuitry, even while no one initially believed it in 1982, seems a bit harder to \"process\" these days.Nevertheless, Daft Punk's soundtrack allows us to forget all of this in the name of science fiction, turn on our iPods and CD Players and relax or be stimulated by the synthetic sounds recreating a synthetic world. Favorite songs include \"Derezzed,\" \"End of Line,\" and \"Tron Legacy.\"Suffice to say, the only thing daft is the movie itself.

Of course knowing it was a score I didn't expect a typical DP album like some of these 1 star morons. The music from TRON Legacy achieves what all the best scores should...it's takes you right back into the film. Just close your eyes, don the headphones and enjoy. Though \"Derezzed\" seemed to make it into all the trailers, there are a few other tracks with a driving beat and that heavy synth DP sound. \"End Of Line\" is very cool, as is \"The Grid\". \"Fall\" is quite dramatic, and \"TRON (end titles)\" kept me in the theatre longer than usual. 2/3 of this score is indeed mood music, but it has emotion and is still well done.

To those purchasing this album solely for the \"Daft Punk\" label, save your time and simply get Derezzed, End of the Line, The Game Changes, and the Finale (Ending Credits) and save yourself the extra money. For those of you who watched the movie and enjoyed the various moods of the movie and the arrangements that went with it, this covers quite a bit of the material. For you completionists out there, it is worth noting that there are some tracks from the original score that are not present on this disc. However, for the price point I felt that this was competely acceptable.This is not an \"Inspired by\" soundtrack, this is the original score, so Daft Punk fans may want to preview the tunes before they sink the money into the full album. This is not to say that this is not a good compilation, but know what you are buying before you think it is a full album.As for the music itself, the only major complaint I have about it is that the score lengths are just a bit too short. While I know that this is a necessary evil in film, some of the finer bits that I wanted to continue (I'm looking at you, \"The Grid\") end all too quickly. The music to the movie seemed to fit very well with a combination of classicial instrumentation to add an epic sound, combined with enough electronica/trance/techno to give it the sci-fi/computer feel to it.In summary, ignore the Daft Punk hype and evaluate this soundtrack on the merits of it being a movie score, rather than an \"inspired by\" disc.

Other than now knowing they are French and have been lifelong fans of the original TRON, I still don't know much about them.  But, that doesn't really matter because their score to TRON: LEGACY is one of the best movie scores in 2010.  Having seen the movie I can say that the score is a superb augmentation of what happens on the screen.  However, other than a few numbers, the score stands on its own as a separate work.  The music is kind of techno-punk.  My favorite numbers are:\"The Son of Flynn\"\"The Arena\"\"Rinzler\"\"The Game Has Changed\"\"Adagio for Tron\"\"End of the Line\"\"Derezzed\"\"Fall\"\"Flynn Lives\"\"Tron Legacy (End Titles)It should be noted that though this is the official soundtrack/score for the movie, it doesn't contain the entire score.  There are four songs on a special edition set that was released only overseas as well as two tunes that were only made available on iTunes. It's kind of disappointing that they won't release they entire score/soundtrack to on one set, but the music industry has been pulling stuff like this for years in attempts to curtail pirating, but such measures actually encourage it.Anyway, I really like the score. The style of music won't appeal to everyone, but it has a broad enough range to at least interest most audiophiles.\n", "val": 0.009547118097543716}

{"text": "Daft Punk is thanking Hans Zimmer, The Maestro, at the end of the CD sleeve. It's no wonder. The sound of this soundtrack is pure \"Remote Control / Media venture\" style, the famous school Hans Zimmer created in order to produce clones of him. I tell ya, is there a musician in the film scoring industry who has helped change his field (for better or worse?)as much as Hans Zimmer?Since he scored \"Crimson Tide\" in 1995, almost everybody is trying to re-create that \"Roll Tide\" sound. We now have a \"Zimmer effect\" or a \"Zimmer touch\" out there. \"Zimmerian\" is now a new adjective in the industry, like \"This is a Zimmerian score\".\"Tron Legacy\", the soundtrack, is of course a guilty pleasure. Each track has a little thing going for it. You put on the CD in your player and you can either relax to it and travel to another time and place or you can just do something else and have it as background music to which you'll catch yourself whistling all the time.The sound is very close to the one heard in \"The Dark Knight\", \"Batman Begins\", \"Transformers\" and \"The Terminator\". I don't know to which degree the Grand Master Zimmer helped but you'll have no problem putting some tracks of this score on a personal \"Remote Control / Media venture\" compilation, along with \"Transformers\", \"Iron Man\", \"Clash Of The Titans\", \"Armageddon\" and others \"Pirates Of The Caribbean\".I'm not familiar with Daft Punk but it's easy to guess that some of the tracks (#12 and #13, mostly) are of their own creation. But the rest is very \"Zimmerian\". If Hans Zimmer didn't help much, well then Daft Punk copied him openly. And like i said, they thanked him at the end...Anyhow, \"Tron Legacy\" is the kind of soundtrack that if you start analysing it, you'll probably end up criticizing it. But if you just put it on and enjoy it, it'll be a guilty pleasure.\"The Grid\" is particularly impressive. The voice of Jeff bridges really is echoing in your car or in your room when it plays.It's a good thing Hans Zimmer is my favorite film composer and it's a good thing that i don't mind all the clones he created (Gregson-Williams, Rabin, Badelt, Glennie-Smith, Jablonski, Djawani, Powell... and now Daft Punk?)\n", "val": 0.003151597687974572}

{"text": "This soundtrack is one of the best I have listened to in recent memory.  I had high hopes for the movie after having listened to this album quite a bit beforehand.  The music is sweeping, epic and intense.  It captures the \"essense\" of Tron quite nicely and really brought the imagery to life for me (in my head at least)!  Unfortunately, I don't think the movie quite lived up to the expectations I'd built around the music.  It wasn't a bad movie to be sure, but it was disappointing after falling in love with the soundtrack like I did.  Daft Punk did an excellent job and they made a smart move in drawing inspiration from the likes of Hans Zimmer and David Powell when writing this score.  Some of it has a very similar feel to the Batman: Dark Knight and Inception soundtracks by Zimmer, which is not at all a bad thing (both scores are fantastic!).  There are moments in the movie where an increase in the soundtrack's volume would have helped bring the movie to life much more.  I found that the music was a bit lost in certain scenes, which was disappointing.I can't say enough good things about the Tron soundtrack and it's well worth picking up for the paltry amount Amazon is charging for the digital download.  Even without the extra tracks mentioned in another review, you're getting a lot of great music for your money.  I rate this album highly recommended!\n", "val": 0.0367526039481163}

Aside from the obvious touches of the classical music vibe that's pretty much embedded in all film scores,it's also somewhat reminiscent of music genre's like new ave & synthpop. Apparently this isn't the complete album but I purchased this through I-tunes which includes 2 bonus tracks exclusively only through them.

{"text": "What is it that makes a memorable soundtrack for a film? It could be a memorable classical score, a great bunch of catchy songs, or a combination of each. Now, what happens if you take those two sounds and actually merge them into one? Well, when Tron Legacy was finally ready to go the director knew like its predicesor it still needed to be ahead of its time. That included the sound of the score. So apparently being a fan of the Electronica gurus Daft Punk, he went to them and the rest is history.I am not a big collector of soundtracks, but the select few I do have just have that certain something. The Tron Legacy soundtrack however has so much more! The score on this soundtrack is a phenomenal blend of electornica with a classical score and the pieces fit perfectly. The sound is fluid and hard hitting and soothing all at the same time. This kind of a collaboration has never been attempted and Daft Punk pulled it off and they should be damn proud.If you are not a fan of these kinds of sounds I promise you once you see how well it works with the movie as a whole you will run to the store and pick this up. The soundtrack actually moves the movie itself along and makes so much better. The Tron Legacy soundtrack is definitely going to set the bar for the way soundtracks are composed in the future and I would have been great to see this soundtrack get nominated for Best Origonal Score, but since the Academy is a bunch of clueless A**bags, another great piece of music gets over looked.\n", "val": 0.004991855006664991}

{"text": "This was my most disappointing CD purchase in a long time. It was also one of my most anticipated soundtracks of the year, or even past few years. It's being advertised as Daft Punk's music, but, even if they actually had the last edit of each track, it's nothing more than a conventional film score with all of the expected twists and turns(and I haven't even seen the movie yet!). I don't even really need to see the movie now, because it was so easy to pick up on the story from the music alone:it doesn't stand on it's own as an album, separate from the movie.I think that their downfall was being tutored by Hans Zimmer(as is hinted in the album credits). Zimmer has a few gems in his past, but he, along with James Newton Howard, create some of the most homogenized, boring back-drop scores today. \"Dark Knight\" had great moments, but other than that, just uneventful soundscapes that float, disconnected from the visuals, themeless. If I want Steve Roach, Robert Rich, or Lustmord, I'll buy their stuff.Daft Punk should've stuck to the formula that's garnered them so much acclaim: pounding, hair-raising electronica anthems that rise to the occasion and force you to feel; rather than boring, string-filled, minute-n-a-half-long snippets that build up quickly and fizzle out just as fast. The two Dafty tracks are good, and the whole album should've consisted of stuff like that.Basically, this soundtrack is: Hans Zimmer revamping the original Tron score, with a couple Daft Punk tunes thrown in for good measure. Very ho-hum, meh, etc.\n", "val": 0.0017702860059216619}
{"text": "The Track ListThis review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:OvertureThe GridFather and SonThe Son of FlynnEncom Part IEncom Part IIRecognizerArmoryArenaRound OneRinzlerThe Game Has ChangedOutlandsAdagio For TronNocturneOutlands, Part IIReflectionsEnd Of LineCastorDerezzedFallSea of SimulationRectifierDisc WarsC.L.U.ArrivalFlynn LivesSunrise PreludeTron Legacy (End Titles)Solar SailerFinaleThe PiecesOverture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.The Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.Father and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.The Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.Encom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.Recognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.Armory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.Arena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.The Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.Outlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.Adagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.Nocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.Reflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.End of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best \"Daft-Punk style\" track on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.Fall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this track as it distracts from the main musical theme played.Sea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.Rectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good track if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.Disc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.C.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.Arrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.Flynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.Sunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.The ScoreTron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.Too Many Adagios?It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest AchievementWhen I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.\n", "val": 0.03206862881779671}

Like an album full of radio edits.If you loved the music in the movie as much as I did and was hoping for some expansion of these music themes, or to hear some source material, or any \"inspired by\" tracks, you won't find it here.What IS here, is quite solid, however.  It's just too abbreviated.  I'll look forward, instead, to further work from the duo that's released as an actual Daft Punk album.\n", "val": 0.00012301075912546366}

I am a bit disappointed that American version of the soundtrack is missing several tracks and a few on the cd have been edited to just a couple of minutes.  I definitely plan on acquiring the 2 cd version of the soundtrack at some point. I would like to hear it as a whole. Now that I got my minor quibbles with the album out of the way, the music in general really blew me away. I liked that the guys in Daft Punk wanted to go beyond what they are known for in dance music. While many music critics were disappointed that the guys would experiment in more orchestral sounds, I thought the blend of classical, ambient, and techno really elevated the film. Of course the guys didn't totally ditched their dance roots. \"Derezzed\" was nothing short of classic Daft Punk. I totally dug \"Tron Legacy\" which combined the haunting melodies of the film's theme song with groovy dance beats. I really enjoyed every single track on the album. I was not disappointed in any of the songs. Tron Legacy is definitely a soundtrack worth owning.\n", "val": 0.01348068192601204}

You can really just lay down, put on some headphones and get transported to your own virtual landscape within your mind.By the way, I had never heard of Daft Punk before watching Tron Legacy, but I'm very impressed with the work they turned in here.

{"text": "Being a fan of both Wendy Carlos and Daft Punk, I was torn--should I wish for the old, or embrace the new?I'm pleased with this score:  its sound may not carry the most recognizable musical themes I remember from the original, but the tone of Daft Punk's score is well matched to the world of Tron just the same.  Consider it more faithful to the *spirit* of Carlos' original score and you'll be happy.  There are sweeping synth passages that pulse and build in intensity (\"Recognizer\"), digital coughs and blips lifted straight out of an '80s arcade, and all of it is arranged in a way that clearly belongs in the film.  Strings blend excellently into the mix, such as the tracks \"Outlands\" and \"Flynn Lives\".Sometimes a soundtrack--particularly one by a mainstream artist--can be more about promoting the artist than it is about the movie (for  example, the \"Spawn\" soundtrack was more about making two bands collaborate for each song and pulling music from multiple genres).  Daft Punk are very focused on the task at hand:  they create a sonic soundscape that reminds me why Vangelis' \"Chariots of Fire\" took the mainstream by storm--\"The Grid\", \"Arena\" and \"Rinzler\" are very similar.  The music to Tron: Legacy sounds just retro enough to hearken back to 1980 while just appealing enough to not sound stale today.If you're looking for a good sampling of what's here, listen to the passage from \"Nocture\" to \"End of Line\" to \"Derezzed\" to \"Fall\".  If you want one of the few moments the score sounds most like Daft Punk, that would be \"Solar Sailor\".  And if you are considering the digital download, yes you do get the booklet.  It doesn't show as available in the track listing but when you download you will receive a digital copy of the booklet in PDF form.NOTE:  the downloadable MP3 album from Amazon contains one bonus track.  However, reviewers are stating that the downloadable version(s) available from other Amazon stores (such as in the UK at Amazon.co.uk) offer a larger \"2 disc\" version of the album.  A completist might want to mull over the difference and download that version instead.  I'm not sure how the exchange rate factors into such a purchase, so if you're not from the UK, keep that in mind.\n", "val": 0.012124603614211082}
{"text": "The music is  one of the things that make the film special. This soundtrack by Daft Punk is truly a symphony of many different sounds.  My favorite track is \"Adagio For Tron\".  This track starts off slow and builds in intensity while maintaining a graceful tone.  I love the violins playing on this song. \"Nocturne\" is another beautiful slow track that I enjoy.  \"Clu\" and \"The Game Has Changed\" are two tracks with a  menacing sounding tone.  \"Clu\" is an intense sounding four minutes.  \"The Game Has Changed\" also has a powerful beat. I love both tracks. \"Solar Sailor\" is a subtle two and a half minutes. This track sounds very soothing to me. I love the upbeat and techno sound of \"Derezzed\". This track pumps me up with energy. \"Outlands\" has a frantic tone to it. \"Rinzler\" has a suspenseful tone to it that is enjoyable to listen to. I really love the variety of tones to this score. The End Titles sound very funky.  It makes me feel more confident for some reason.  The music of Daft Punk is empowering, exciting and serene at certain moments of this soundtrack.

The special effects, the story and the acting from Jeff Bridges, Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde are top notch. Above all the true star of Tron:Legacy is the score by Daft Punk. Everyone knows how great a fan of the original film they are. They take that love for the first film and translate it to the new film in a very beautiful way. The original film was a product of it's time, the 1980's and it's score by Walter \"Wendy\" Carlos, also a product of it's time. Not only does the soundtrack make homage to the original, but it takes 80's synth and makes it fresh and new.

{"text": "There are plenty of reviews for this soundtrack, so I will briefly offer the opinions of a Sci-Fi / Industrial & Classical music fan, with the recommendation that you also read some of the other excellent reviews.  Given that TRON: Legacy is about life literally inside the electronic world, how appropriate is it that Amazon offered a digital copy of the CD liner notes with the mp3 album?  Normally I like to buy hard copies to get the liner notes of pieces of work that I find myself wanting to listen to in their entirety.  Based on the samples (which are excellent) offered here, I knew I liked enough of the tracks that I wanted the entire album.  The bonus of getting the CD liner notes in a digital format made my decision easy.After downloading the album, there were a number of tracks that immediately appealed to me.  While I am a fan of industrial music (and classical music as well ... I know, it seems like an odd fit, but it is actually pretty common amongst musicians), I was never into Daft Punk's lighter weight electronic music.  They did an amazing job with the Tron: Legacy soundtrack!I've listed a number of tracks I recommend you sample (the samples are representative of what I like about the tracks).  I've also expanded upon what I like about a few of these.Recommended Tracks:* Recognizer* Rinzler* The Game Has Changed* Overture* The Grid* Outlands* End of Line* Arena* DerezzedThe opening track, overture, has an Aaron Copland feel to it (specifically his&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Copland-Appalachian-Spring-Rodeo-Fanfare-for-the-Common-Man/dp/B000003CSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Copland: Appalachian Spring; Rodeo; Fanfare for the Common Man</a>).  To put this into words, I've always felt that Copland's modern era classic music beautifully invokes an optimistic sense of space and exploration that is easily associated with North America's wide expanses.  What an excellent way to begin the soundtrack.As a fan of industrial music, the concept of using spoken word to begin a song or even throughout is common place.  Many artists do this early in their album in order to literally focus the audience and further define the scope of the rest of the album.  With that in mind, I liked Jeff Bridge's spoken introduction in the Grid.The track Rinzler appealed to the \"rivet head\" (industrial music fan) in me.  Though short, it is the perfect loud, fast paced, beat driven character theme and introduction.  In less than two minutes it starts off slow and uncertain, but quickly picks up pace to provide an aural definition to Rinzler's intensity and devotion.  Without even seeing the film, a listener knows that Rinzler is pivotal to the story.  This track continues with the next track, the Game Has Changed, in which the protagonist of the story / soundtrack (Sam) is pitted against the antagonist Rinzler.  With the conflict now established, the story and soundtrack can really begin.  If you liked these two tracks, I encourage you to listen to some of Bear McCreary's reimaged&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-3/dp/B000UZ4C4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Battlestar Galactica: Season 3</a>&nbsp;soundtracks.Finally, while programmers and fans of the original Tron film should be pleased by the track \"End of Line\" based on its namesake alone, the track itself also hails back to the style and tempo of the original film.  If you liked this track, you might enjoy music from electronic-industrial artists such as Monstrum Sepsis (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Movement/dp/B000CAGL7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Movement</a>) or Gridlock (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Formless/dp/B000120ZUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Formless</a>).Conclusion:The samples do an excellent job of characterizing the tracks.  The soundtrack itself stands alone without having seen the movie (yet).  It tells a story (something any good album should do) using a variety of tempos and character based themes.  And finally, the digital download was quick and included the complete liner notes (which are naturally visually attractive).\n", "val": 0.02207896113395691}

{"text": "I've been a Daft Punk fan for about two months now. I reviewed \"For Lack of a Better Name\" by Deadmau5 and an interesting discussion followed. Amazon reviewer P. Harper said: \"Gary! Gotta go with Daft Punk!!\" Well, OK. That seemed like a good suggestion. I ordered a packet of two live recordings, mainly because I've never been to an electronica concert and have little prospect of doing so. To put it simply, the \"Alive 2007\" disc is one of the best live concert recordings I've ever heard. Hence, my recent interest in Daft Punk. In looking over their other available selections, I noticed a \"Tron Legacy\" soundtrack album was due out on December 7. If you haven't heard, the music is by Daft Punk backed by a 90-piece orchestra. Hmmmm, that might be interesting! I was reminded of the Metallica \"S&M\" album where Metallica was backed by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. It's  a very interesting piece of music, I might indicate. Anyway, the \"Tron\" series of movies is not something I'm familiar with. I bought the CD for the Daft Punk music.I'm not totally satisfied with the disc. The music is well done, the recording is excellent and it's a very interesting piece of work. I think there's no doubt that it will get an Academy Award nomination and may well win. It's just that kind of a production. I guess my feeling was that it's too much sound-track orchestra and not enough Daft Punk. Even when Daft Punk comes in to play, the orchestra comes in so intrusively that it almost obscures the underlying Daft Punk music. Well, I'm sure they intended it that way and it's just a minor personal preference of mine to note. Overall, it's a dramatic and quite excellent album, but I just don't care for it nearly as much as I do for the \"Alive 2007\" disc. In any case, I'm definitely planning on seeing the movie and enjoying the music on a theater sound system in a cavernous auditorium. It should be awesome!Gary Peterson\n", "val": 0.013519389554858208}
{"text": "Simply put, Daft Punk's music for 'Tron: Legacy' sets exactly the tone it should: vast, dark, dramatic, rhythmic, cinematic, and best of all, original.Daft Punk is known for experiments in electronic music, which might make you think that their score here is solely electronic noise in nature. This might fit the themes of the movie in its own way, but there's a lot more to it. The real surprise here is the level of symphonic music that is used, often fused with the electronic instruments, to create waves and rhythms at dramatic moments. I've heard this done before - most notably by Hybrid on their landmark album \"Wide Angle\" - but I've never heard it done quite like this.In terms of film music, we're on somewhat more familiar ground. The music for 'Tron: Legacy' is deep and rhythmic and pervasive. There is no simple, catchy hero's theme or menacing villain's cue here, which works to the benefit of the music (and, I expect, the film). Daft Punk instead follows the cue of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard in their Batman music. The pulsing waves of \"Recognizer\" sound much like something we might have heard in 'The Dark Knight,' but with just enough of a twist to keep it interesting. While listening to 'Tron: Legacy' for the first time, I also thought about the music of Cliff Martinez ('Solaris') or Clint Mansell ('Moon'), but again struck more by contrasts than by similarities. The music of 'Tron: Legacy' may have borrowed from the idea of other composers, but in Daft Punk's able hands those ideas went in different directions and the result is mostly original and stands up nicely on its own.The album is best listened to from beginning to end, but there are a few tracks that stand out from the pack. I have to admit to a little geeky thrill running up my spine when I heard Jeff Bridges' wonderfully rich voice narrating a few choice lines about \"The Grid.\" You can get your blood pumping to \"The Game Has Changed,\" feel the oppressive danger of the \"Recognizer\" and bring it to a fever pitch of panic with \"Rectifier.\" The steady, rising notes of \"Solar Sailer\" set a majestic tone while \"Adagio for Tron\" brings the emotional crescendo home.The truth is that the whole album is good, from the first track to the last. Daft Punk's score is a worthy successor to Wendy Carlos' music for the original 'Tron' for this simple reason: it's original. It fuses the electronic and the symphonic, uses what works and breaks some new ground - it excites the senses and flows naturally from the idea of the film.I only hope the movie is this good! The music makes me more excited to find out.\n", "val": 0.033086683601140976}

{"text": "I'm going to finally come out of the woodwork and give this soundtrack a much deserved five star rating because of the Daft Punk fans flipping out there are 'no vocals' on this album.What do you expect?  It's a SOUNDTRACK.  Daft Punk should be PROUD of their work, I wish their fans would be too.  This is a wonderful electronica/orchestral score, and very rarely do you get scores that sound so new and fresh. Or that combine the two different mediums. I think the score reminds me a bit of Trevor Jones' score for Labyrinth.The reason why I think this score works for the movie is that you need orchestral bits for the human bonding scenes.  You also need that electronica beat for the TRON world.  Which is what Wendy Carlos did for the original TRON score.Now, my review on the actual soundtrack.  The soundtrack has an 'overture'.  It's that epic, people.  And does it sound glorious.  I love the mixture of dialogue and music ('The Grid').  Some tracks have a very dangerous vibe to it (for example the 'Recognizer' track).  The world inside of a computer has VASTLY improved since the 1980's, and we can all agree on that.  You need something on par with the epic world that Flynn and many other game designers create.Overall, I find this soundtrack a fresh listen.  Of course, you're going to get people that say it sounds like Hans Zimmer.  And I can't argue that Daft Punk uses a lot of 'themes' over and over, but I think certain themes represent a certain character.  Kind of like what John Williams had going on with Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  (I have not seen the movie, so I am just basing it off what I think is going on as I listen.)This is a movie about a father and son finding one another again, this is a movie where it's gonna be a battle of creator against creation.  I want this to sound epic and I want this to sound dangerous, too.  And I think Daft Punk did an AWESOME job of making the score for Tron Legacy sound as epic and dangerous as it can be.  I hope that they are given another chance at doing more soundtracks, because this one proved to me that they're that talented to tackle different mediums.\n", "val": 0.04937713220715523}

{"text": "The choice of Daft Punk to score this film was probably an inspired one.  I was a little unsure at first about the idea of blending synthesizers with an orchestral score, but the end result works quite well.  It seemed to me that the film would require a purely synthetic music score, due to the subject matter, but Daft Punk has pulled off a nice balance here, and the score is dominated by neither synth nor orchestra, but creates a seamless fusion. I also expected quite a bit of quoting of Wendy Carlos' original score themes, but that turns out not to be the case, with but a few exceptions.  All in all, Daft Punk has created a mostly original soundscape for this sequel, and one that is quite an enjoyable listening experience all on its own. I can't comment on how it works in the film, since it hasn't yet been released to theaters as of this writing.  So many remake/sequel scores seem to be a letdown when compared to the original, but thankfully not only isn't that the case here, but what Daft Punk has crafted is actually superior to the original.\n", "val": 0.058415014296770096}

{"text": "When it was first announced Daft Punk would be doing the score for \"Tron: Legacy,\" anyone who has ever held the original film on a pedestal among sci-fi movies was most likely overcome with joy.After all, Daft Punk's synthesized sound pulls a great deal from the early `80s when the original film was released. Even their helmeted costumes seem to resemble those worn in the computer world of \"Tron.\"However, what Daft Punk created was something much more serious than any of their studio albums. Like Christopher Nolan's new take on \"Batman,\" \"Tron: Legacy\" has been described as much darker than the original film and Daft Punk's score, released ten days before the film, follows suit.The overture introduces Daft Punk's newest adventure with quite possibly the biggest departure from their original sound to be heard on the record.Gentle horns gradually fill the air just as a full string section takes shape. By the end of \"Overture,\" timpani, cymbals, and a gong provide the ultimate climax, dramatically announcing Daft Punk's first full collaborative venture into cinema and the return of Tron simultaneously.\"The Grid\" is the only track with any words put to the music. With Jeff Bridges providing a voiceover for the first half of the track, the song acts as an introduction for anyone who may have missed the first film.As \"The Grid\" fades out and \"The Son Of Flynn\" opens with an arpeggiated synthesizer, listeners get their first taste of Daft Punks blend between their own unique sound and classical music. Although the majority of the tracks on \"Tron: Legacy\" utilize an excellent balance between the two styles, some of the tracks sway one way or the other, drastically changing the mood of the piece.Tracks like \"The Game Has Changed\" offer an almost exclusively classical instrumentation while transforming the percussion section into a series of powerful electronic hits, rattling the eardrums and taking focus off of the ominous strings hidden beneath.Although the London Philharmonic Orchestra provides all of the string arrangements, their true feature comes on \"Adagio for Tron.\" Sounding a bit like Hans Zimmer's \"Hummel Gets the Rockets\" from the soundtrack for \"The Rock,\" Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punk use this track as a means of showing off their prowess with orchestration, complete with a simple, yet beautiful cello solo.As the mood darkens, the music dives deeper into the electronic realm while still maintaining at least some aspects of a symphonic orchestra. Tracks like \"End of Line\" pull entirely from the electronic realm except for a sustained string part which would typically get lost in a Daft Punk mix, but because of their extraordinary presence on the rest of the album, they remain surprisingly noticeable.Easily the song most reminiscent of Daft Punk's previous work is the club ready \"Derezzed.\" It's almost hard to believe this track falls on the same album as \"Adagio for Tron,\" but Daft Punk fans will make \"Derezzed\" the song from the movie to know. Although less than two minutes in length, \"Derezzed\" finds Daft Punk letting loose and presenting their trademark sound for the world to see on the big screen.Without words to accompany the music, this album may not ring as positively for all Daft Punk fans, but it will easily add a great deal to the action captured on film. This may be Daft Punk's first venture into film soundtracks, but the duo's masterful work on \"Tron: Legacy\" makes it hard to believe it will be their last.Similar Artists: Justice, Deadmau5Track Suggestion: \"Adagio for Tron\"\n", "val": 0.02549002319574356}

In fact, much of the soundtrack barrows from the Hans Zimmer school of thinking, not just the certain horn structure that was so infamously from Inception (The Game has Changed), but the strings, how the strings are arranged, the moods given off, etc. Granted, I know the soundtrack was composed before Inception ever came out, but the whole thing sounds very Zimmer-Esque.Why is this? Well, the soundtrack may be \"by\" Daft Punk, but Joseph Trapanese did much of the orchestrations, with only the guidance of Daft Punk. Daft themselves did the electronic work. As a result, the work sounds very much like a modern soundtrack. But since Zimmer holds the example of the modern soundtrack currently in my mind, it sounds very derivitive of that for me. Not that this is a bad thing per say, but the entire score does hold an ever-present feeling of familiarity. It's mixed up by the electronic elements of course, which sound something straight out of a future nightclub, complete with weird DJ stuff, drumbeats and other tricks of the Daft Punk trade.

There are a couple of track which are more standard Daft Punk sounding and likely to get so mainstream radio play (I'd already heard one on BBC Radio One on Sirius/Xm Sat.

Many have a John Carpenter feel (in The Thing or  The Fog, maybe)... I also found myself comparing them to another 80-90's Composer Vangelis' work on Blade Runner or his Direct album.The only complaint I have is the lack of any call-back to the original score, or at least Tron's theme... by Wendy Carlos and the late conductor Richard Bowden.

{"text": "First off, I'm a huge TRON fan and when I learned that Disney was returning to an all-but forgotten film of the early 80's, truly ground breakingly way ahead of its time to feature the very first CGI, albeit archaic akin to glorifed vector graphics by today's standards, to a society that didn't even know it (how could they? it would be at least another 10 years before computers were considered a household tool). Second, I'm not a Daft Punk fan. Nothing personal, dance/electronica just isn't my cup of tea but I do think they were a perfect choice in the context of this film so I will remain objective.Like most sci-fi/action effects movies, they tend have really one or two main themes that run through the entirety of their respective soundtracks with only a slight change of tempo or some additional rhythems blended in with the reoccurring main theme. This is nothing new. John Williams is infamous for doing just this in most of his movie compositions but most notably, Star Wars.... and Daft Punk's TRON: Legacy soundtrack is no exception, which is perfectly fine. They do throw in a couple of fast beats, like 'Derezzed' and 'End Of Line', which could be considered throw-away filler tracks on any of their normal album releases but I'm sure they fit the context of the sequences in the film in which they are featured but on the soundtrack, detatched from the film, I find them to a bit weak and actually disrupt the flow of the rest of the soundtrack.The themes here are soft, hypnotic beats and tones that really immerse the listener into a visionary world of a microprocessing network or \"The Grid\" that feels cold, calculating and overall menacing yet simultaneously beautiful. I was excited about this movie before. Having given this soundtrack about 4 or 5 listens now, my enthusiasm just got 'amped' up.I think what I like most about this soundtrack is that it doesn't overindulge with heaping piles of unnecessary layers. Imagine a minimalist Phillip Glass.Daft Punk's first outing into the world of movie soundtrack composition is by no means Genious or Instant Classic but it's effective. As the title of my review states, it's \"competent\". I look forward hearing more of their work in future movies. I just hope Daft Punk doesn't get relegated to doing just Sci-Fi/Techie films.As for the \"heavily inspired\" part of this album, when I heard it for the first time, I immediately thought 'Koyaanisqatsi' meets 'Escape From New York'. The more I listened the more apparent the connection became. Whether it was inentional or not, I felt it both fit the underlying theme of the TRON story as well as a general tip-of-the-hat to obscure action/sci-fi films of the late 70's/early 80's.It's not great but it's different and very accessable.

{"text": "Let me just start out by stating that Daft Punk is/are my favorite artist(s). Yes, I'm one of those devoted people who will buy multiple copies to get all of the exclusives.  I own literally everything they've ever done. Everything from official releases, to live concert recordings, to dozens of other various bootlegs. So needless to say, when I heard they were approached to compose the score for the upcoming Tron Legacy film I was beyond ecstatic. As a child I grew up watching the movie Tron many times but it never really stuck with me compared to the likes of other sci-fi films such as Star Wars, Alien etc.. Tron's original soundtrack by Wendy Carlos never left an impression with me either even being a film score and electronica fanatic. Now, times have changed and Daft Punk has blessed us with the Tron Legacy score. No strangers to film, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have the combined talents of film production, cinematography and film score composition all under their belts. This is all in addition to their enormous amount of material released under the Daft Punk name as well as many others. Bangalter also composed the score to French film, Irr&eacute;versible in 2002. de Homem-Christo has also worked as a film director in addition to his music production. Together, over the last 17+ years Daft Punk has produced some of the most brilliant and timeless electronic music enthusiasts like myself have ever heard. I still remember being completely floored the very first time I listened to their \"Homework\" album. Tron Legacy is their first collaboration in years and I'm happy to report that it delivers. Faithful to the Tron style, if fits the theme of the film flawlessly in every way. Here are my thoughts and track ratings on Daft Punk's \"Tron Legacy\" soundtrack;1. Overture 8/10 (Grand and sweeping orchestral theme)2. The Grid 8/10 (Jeff Bridges vocal samples over an intro track)3. The Son of Flynn 8/10 (Melodic synthesizer)4. Recognizer 10/10 (Epic and moving electronic strings and horns)5. Armory 8/10 (Slow soundscape)6. Arena 8/10 (Building synth and drum track)7. Rinzler 10/10 (Fast paced building drum, string and synth track)8. The Game Has Changed 10/10 (A perfect blend of tracks 4 & 7)9. Outlands 9/10 (Fast paced strings and horns)10. Adagio for TRON 8/10 (Orchestral & electronic Adagio blend)11. Nocturne 8/10 (Melancholic and slow)12. End of Line 8/10 (Synth, beats with arcade game sounds)13. Derezzed 10/10 (Daft Punk 4x4 electronic brilliance)14. Fall 10/10 (Frantic strings, drums, horns and feedback)15. Solar Sailer 8/10 (Peaceful electronica)16. Rectifier 10/10 (Dark and menacing strings and horns)17. Disc Wars 9/10 (Tense and building strings, synth and drums)18. C.L.U. 10/10 (More tense building strings, synth, horns and drums)19. Arrival 8/10 (Sorrowful track reminiscent of Vangelis' Bladerunner)20. Flynn Lives 8/10 (Triumphant and redeeming horns and strings)21. TRON Legacy (End Titles) 9/10 (Traditional 808/909 sounding synthesizer track) 8/1022. Finale 8/10 (Uplifting orchestral)23. Sea of Simulation (Amazon Exclusive) 8/10 (Standard synth track.  Not a mind blowing exclusive, but I'll take it nonetheless)Brilliantly composed and arranged in nearly every way I can think of no better choice than Daft Punk to have scored the next installment of Tron. Filled with a fantastic blend of electronic beats, smooth synthesizers, staccato strings, driving drums and epic horns, Tron Legacy is everything both Daft Punk and Tron fans can appreciate. With the film quickly approaching I know I'll be going to see it simply to hear Daft Punk's score blasting out of the theater's speaker system accompanying what I'm hoping to be a mesmerizing continuation of the original Tron. Even though I wouldn't consider myself a huge Tron fan, I have to admit, after hearing Daft Punk's score, I'm a lot more excited about the film.\n", "val": 0.03587357699871063}

I'd suggest paying close attention so that you know what you're buying... because you're in for the ride of your life.With their considerable talent and a full orchestra to back up their efforts, Daft Punk refused to simply refine older techniques into a movie score. The soundtrack is just that - a score for a movie that sounds as epic and expansive as I expect from the Tron universe. It is darker, yes. It is not music that you'll hear playing in a club. If you're looking for a score and not an album (this is no Discovery), go ahead and buy. You'll be very happy with the decision.My personal favorite tracks:It's impossible to ignore \"Derezzed.\" In the rush to listen to the song, though, I nearly brushed over \"End of Line,\" a slower, more insistent track that catches some of the same darkness that is hinted at in \"Derezzed.\" There is a thickness to the production of these tracks that crowds up around your ears; the presence of noise and slight blips and beeps underneath the melody fascinates me as I keep picking out new elements in every listen-through.When I finally get to see the movie, I intend to stay through the credits. Both \"Tron Legacy (End Titles)\" and \"Finale\" seem to cap off the soundtrack well - though the swelling low brass of \"Finale\" leads me to believe that we'll see content after the titles when the movie reaches theaters. Or the credits will be significantly long.The Amazon Exclusive track, \"Sea of Simulation,\" is interesting to say the least. I've moved it to several spots within the order so that it doesn't hide away at the end of \"Finale.\" Despite the efforts, though, I haven't found a good spot for it. It has the tone that reminds me slightly of \"Solar Sailer,\" another one of the stand-out tracks in the score, with a brighter tone and a quicker tempo. If \"Sea of Simulation\" is the deciding factor between buying this soundtrack on Amazon mp3 or purchasing a physical copy, I suggest the digital copy with the exclusive song.\n", "val": 0.000718255527317524}

{"text": "While listening to this soundtrack I found myself playing a game of \"Match the track to the movie scene.\"\"Something is probably being absconded during this track.\"\"I would peg this one for an epic battle piece.\"\"This one would make a pretty good character death track.\"\"Alright, this one has to be the ending credits.\" *checks track* \"Yep, ending credits.\"Naturally, given the time of this review, I haven't seen the film yet.  The point I'm trying to make though is that this soundtrack is pretty standard stuff and really doesn't tread over any new ground that hasn't been covered before.That's not to say that it isn't well-composed.  The album mostly consists of sweeping orchestra pieces, lightly sprinkled with electronica.  However, with exception of Derezzed, most of the tracks often felt repetitive.It's a decent listen and worth the price that I paid for it (which was $3.99 at the time).  It probably will also do an excellent job complementing the movie.  However it doesn't stand too well on its own. If you're looking for that edgy, new, innovative electronica album that you can throw on repeat, you won't find it here.  Rob Dougan would probably be a better bet if you're looking for an artist that blends electronica and orchestral music well.\n", "val": 0.005696583539247513}
{"text": "At last the OST for \"TRON: Legacy\" has arrived, and, having anticipated it for quite some time, I can truly say that this work by far exceeds all my highest expectations. Taken as a whole, this soundtrack \"fits\" together nicely. It sounds like a logical flow from the same central idea (viz. the film) whilst still retaining diversity and differing, nuanced emotions. It is also obvious that, though it is true that there is a substantial orchestral component, Daft Punk was the guiding force behind this soundtrack's creation; indeed, the electronic music of traditional Daft Punk plus the more traditionally-scored analog orchestra do not disagree with each other or cancel each other out--rather, they complement one another, as (in my opinion) is proper for this project.In comparison with the original \"TRON\" score by Wendy Carlos, this too in my opinion nicely complements the original. In addition to showing some continuity nods to the original TRON (as John Green \"Darkwriter\" has meticulously and excellently pointed out in a previous review), the feel of the soundtrack is appropriate in its difference. The score to the 1982 film is replete with both synthesizers and traditional instruments, but the synthesizers had that '70s-'80s feel about them, which, combined with the imagery of the original \"TRON\", was quite apropos for its era and worked quite well (especially when considered in retrospect). The \"TRON: Legacy\" score achieves much the same for its era, but, thankfully, it does not forget its roots. The progression of the franchise evidences an expansion on similar themes, not a replacement: The stylistic underpinnings of the imagery and score have evolved considerably in the twenty-eight intervening years, but the aura exuded by the current project is obviously rooted in the expression of the original as opposed to burning it to the ground and starting anew.TL;DR: Superb album, and a worthy successor to the original.\n", "val": 0.04644472524523735}

I was in college and I saw it on a whim in an afternoon matinee.  I was completely amazed and hooked.  I went back and saw it again that evening, and again the following day, maybe even twice (this was back in the days before everyone had video players).  I have since watched the original 1982 TRON many, many times.  Then when the trailers and promos for TRON:LEGACY hit the screens, I started salivating.Today I saw the TRON:LEGACY soundtrack MP3 version on sale for $3.99, so I pounced on it.  I've been listening to it on and off all day and I have to say that two things have struck me.  First of all, it is heavy electronica, but not overbearing.  That is appropriate given the nature of the film it supports.  Secondly, it is engaging but not overpowering music, though in a few tracks here and there the music really drives!You need to know up front that many of the tracks are quite similar to each other, but that also makes sense since this music provides the background for a world inside the web, where electronics are everything.  And, the music provides a consistency of place and environment that I look forward to experiencing in the movie.I have been a fan of electronica-focused music since I started listening to the Alan Parsons Project (APP) in the late 1970s (I am still a fan and APP music appears regularly on my playlists).  If you like APP and the original movie TRON, I think I can say with a pretty high degree of confidence that you will like this soundtrack.  Now, with that said, you are not likely to hear any of these instrumental tracks anyplace other than during the movie or on this album.  There are no chart-climbers here.  Even so, I am extremely glad that I purchased this album.  It is enjoyable, listenable, and makes me look forward to the theatrical release of TRON:LEGACY even more.5 stars for fans of electronica (e.g, APP) and TRON4 stars for most everyone elseBTW - my teenaged sons and I plan to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tron-20th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005OCMR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;immediately before we head to the theater to see TRON:LEGACY later this month.

{"text": "When the word got out that Daft Punk would be scoring the sequel to TRON it generated something of a phenomenon- where fans were more excited for a soundtrack than a movie itself.Unlike the original TRON soundtrack, there's no silliness or cheesy comedy on display here; the ridiculous scherzo is replaced with both a poignant adagio and a nocturne to underscore the higher stakes in this upgrade to the TRON saga. Orchestrations mixed with techno beats might put off those looking for a pure Daft Punk release, but remember this is a movie score and tracks will be scene-specific and somewhat repetitive in their themes. Plotlines and emotional arcs are being explored here; the symphony lends gravitas to the proceedings and it all comes out pretty good. The only real negatives here are that most tracks are pretty short, clocking in between 1  to 2  minutes. The other is that this isn't a complete release- a few tracks are held back for the deluxe version and one is only available directly from iTunes. How typically Disney...Wendy Carlos' semi-iconic 24-note TRON theme is used both sparingly and excessively; you get heavy doses of it, but only in the tracks at the beginning, middle and end of the cd. There's also a couple of secondary themes at work here, notably a cello rush and sub-tonal pulsing rhythm that are very effective at setting the mood. The rest of the cuts are peppered with soundscapes that are strikingly similar to Hans Zimmer, Brad Fiedel, and a couple others. But after having seen the flick, I can say it does all fit very well.Some Highlights: *Potential Spoilers*Overture- Begins with a single extended synth note underscored by cello until a solo trombone breaks in at the 0:25 mark with a couple of solemn two-noters before it blossoms into a reprise of the TRON theme at 0:52. At 1:35 the synths, string and brass come together (in a pretty rough edit) for another reprise. A very nice build up, but it doesn't appear in the film.The Grid- Used for the movie's opening sequence, it starts with a brief plot exposition delivered by Jeff Bridges, supported by a pulsing percussion and the debut of one of the secondary themes- an 8-note pulsing reverb- accompanied by a string version of the theme before ending with a TRON reprise in synth.Recognizer- Named for the police program that sends Sam Flynn and other captured programs to the arena games.  Built upon the second major theme- the 8-note cello rush- accompanied by some Zimmer-style bottom and driving sub-tones, it also incorporates an alternate TRON keyboard motif to flesh things out. Very reminiscent of the themes from 'The Dark Knight'.Rinzler- 8-note sub-tonal intro highlighted by a couple of 4-note crashing percussion sets. Some eerie synth notes blend into a pulsed rhythm supported by cello. Synths and rhythm rise in full with a new set of dystopian percussion before falling into a fade out.  A nice intro for C.L.U.'s enigmatic enforcer.The Game Has Changed- Plays during this film's version of the iconic- and very well done- lightcycle battle, it's also the track used in the initial teaser footage and first trailers. Starts with the 8-note sub-tonal pulse used in 'Rinzler', it only takes ten seconds for the dystopic drums to appear. At :20 seconds they crash head on with a violin rush behind them. Switches to strings and synths until the sub-tones return at 1:13 and the string emerge again, followed by more synth. This sequence repeats a couple times with some alternate synths and filtering thrown in making for a dark, intriguing mix before ending with the crashing drums.End of Line- Welcome to the most exclusive club in The Grid.  Shades of Thomas Dolby with the snare and kick synth combo. Leads into high and mid layered keyboards before adding a couple layers of 7-note synths to carry it. Add in some flutter and warbling effects and it's not bad.Derezzed- Used for the smackdown fight scene inside the End of Line Club between the heroes and some goons- it's 100% Daft Punk! Fast, frenzied and completely schizoid- and I love the ending when it goes all off-kilter and spastic... in a good way! Only thing wrong with it is it's over way too soon at only 1:44.TRON Legacy End Credits- Built upon repeating layers of 5-note synths over a 4-note looped drum track. At 1:18 the TRON theme comes in on keyboard. The third time through the theme it gets fleshed out with part of the orchestra as the synths drop underneath. Makes for a nice denouement.Though I'm not a big fan of the franchise this soundtrack had me pumped up to see this flick and it's a flawless complement to the movie. An excellent piece of work.\n", "val": 0.0011015504132956266}

{"text": "Let me just start out by stating that Daft Punk is/are my favorite artist(s).  I own literally everything they've ever done.  Everything from official releases, to live concert recordings, to dozens of other various bootlegs.  So needless to say, when I heard they were approached to compose the score for the upcoming Tron Legacy film I was beyond ecstatic.  As a child I grew up watching the movie Tron many times but it never really stuck with me compared to the likes of other sci-fi films such as Star Wars, Alien etc..  Tron's original soundtrack by Wendy Carlos never left an impression with me either even being a film score and electronica fanatic.  Now, times have changed and Daft Punk has blessed us with the Tron Legacy score.  No strangers to film, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have the combined talents of film production, cinematography and film score composition all under their belts.  This is all in addition to their enormous amount of material released under the Daft Punk name as well as many others.  Bangalter also composed the score to French film, Irr&eacute;versible in 2002.  de Homem-Christo has also worked as a film director in addition to his music production.  Together, over the last 17+ years Daft Punk has produced some of the most brilliant and timeless electronic music enthusiasts like myself have ever heard.  I still remember being completely floored the very first time I listened to their \"Homework\" album.  Tron Legacy is their first collaboration in years and I'm happy to report that it delivers.  Faithful to the Tron style, if fits the theme of the film flawlessly in every way.  Here are my thoughts and track ratings on Daft Punk's \"Tron Legacy\" soundtrack;1.  Overture  8/10 (Grand and sweeping orchestral theme)2.  The Grid  8/10 (Jeff Bridges vocal samples over an intro track)3.  The Son of Flynn  8/10 (Melodic synthesizer)4.  Recognizer  10/10 (Epic and moving electronic strings and horns)5.  Armory  8/10 (Slow soundscape)6.  Arena  8/10 (Building synth and drum track)7.  Rinzler  10/10 (Fast paced building drum, string and synth track)8.  The Game Has Changed  10/10 (A perfect blend of tracks 4 & 7)9.  Outlands  9/10 (Fast paced strings and horns)10. Adagio for TRON  8/10 (Orchestral & electronic Adagio blend)11. Nocturne  8/10 (Melancholic and slow)12. End of Line  8/10 (Synth, beats with arcade game sounds)13. Derezzed  10/10 (Daft Punk 4x4 electronic brilliance)14. Fall  10/10 (Frantic strings, drums, horns and feedback)15. Solar Sailer  8/10 (Peaceful electronica)16. Rectifier  10/10 (Dark and menacing strings and horns)17. Disc Wars  9/10 (Tense and building strings, synth and drums)18. C.L.U.  10/10 (More tense building strings, synth, horns and drums)19. Arrival  8/10 (Sorrowful track reminiscent of Vangelis' Bladerunner)20. Flynn Lives  8/10 (Triumphant and redeeming horns and strings)21. TRON Legacy (End Titles)  9/10 (Traditional 808/909 sounding synthesizer track)  8/1022. Finale  8/10  (Uplifting orchestral)Brilliantly composed and arranged in nearly every way I can think of no better choice than Daft Punk to have scored the next installment of Tron.  Filled with a fantastic blend of electronic beats, smooth synthesizers, staccato strings, driving drums and epic horns, Tron Legacy is everything both Daft Punk and Tron fans can appreciate.  With the film quickly approaching I know I'll be going to see it simply to hear Daft Punk's score blasting out of the theater's speaker system accompanying what I'm hoping to be a mesmerizing continuation of the original Tron.  Even though I wouldn't consider myself a huge Tron fan, I have to admit, after hearing Daft Punk's score, I'm a lot more excited about the film.\n", "val": 0.03415825590491295}

The few standouts are THE GAME HAS CHANGED, END OF LINE, FALL, RECTIFIER, SEA OF SIMULATION and the almost homage to Ms. Carlos; ADAGIO FOR TRON.Still it's worth buying if you are a Tron fan like me, but I would have loved to see what would Wendy write for Legacy had he been asked to.\n", "val": 0.0003476788115222007}

{"text": "I find myself playing this CD over and over again without skipping a track as my wife and I travel. Tank is an exceptional writer and vocalist. One of the things that garners my affinity for the album is that he doesn't make the mistake of mixing A side and B side tracks for the sake of catering to different audiences on the same CD. This CD is for lovers; it's for the guy that is searching for the right words to say, and it's for the women that are desirous of knowing what love should look like. The beats are just seductive and middle of the road enough for the delicate balance between Hip/Hop and R&B. Tank hit this one of out the park. As I previewed the new album, it is a continuation of the same. I just ordered two copies; one for each vehicle! My only regret is that he doesn't receive the credit he deserves in quantity (sales) as some of these studio contrived artists that sound terrible live. Watch some of Tank's live performances on-line; he's the truth. That is rare these days. I just hope more people catch on an appreciate this throwback style artist before the record company attempts to re-create him. I can't really choose a favorite track on the album, but the song with Chris Brown (Foreplay), Emergency (clever metaphors), the Bonnie Raitt remake (I Can't Make You Love Me), Celebration (ft/Drake) and You Mean That Much are all power singles!!! Congrats Tank...many more sales and successes brother! God bless!\n", "val": 0.007792576216161251}

{"text": "It took me a little while to warm up to Tank. I had not listened closely to the lyrics of \"Maybe I Deserve\" until recently and now I know just how powerful the song is lyrically. Unfortunately, it was featured on a terrible album he released entitled \"Force of Nature.\" That is simply one of the worse albums I have ever listened to. Fast forward. I recently saw Tank at the 2011 Essence Music Festival and I liked him. He is a confident and sexy guy, so I decided to give him another try. I am delighted that I did because \"Now or Never\" was a sensational listening experience!\"Now or Never\" is heavy on the ballads, but that is always fine with a sap such as myself. The ballads are quite touching. Yes, indeed, the songwriting here is something else! He's a fine songwriter. \"Emergency\" is one of my favorite songs. I listened to it over and over again. I like the hook and the emotion he sang with. \"Amazing\" is another highlight where Tank gives us his best falsetto. Here, Tank is telling his woman how amazing and incredible she is. It's a true love song. \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" has a nice melody, but sad words. Ironically, the most sub-par song here is one that he joins forces with Chris Brown on: \"Foreplay.\" I'm sorry, but this song is simply average. With all that talent on a track, I feel that these fellers could have done something better.Overall, this album is certainly a winner. I recommend it to lovers of R&B music. I enjoyed just about every moment.Mikeisha's Top 51. \"Can I\"2. \"I Can't Make You Love Me\"3. \"Emergency\"4. \"Amazing\"5. \"Sex Music\"\n", "val": 0.004311858210712671}

{"text": "In 2001, a slow jam (Maybe I Deserve) about heartbreak by an upcoming  artist named Tank was all over the radio. The song didn't really impress me, however his second single Slowly blew and I decided to give his debut album Forces Of Nature a chance. Needless to say the album wasn't that good and his follow up release One Man didn't fare much better for me either. Tank was M.I.A. for five years before his next release the worthy follow up Sex, Love & Pain which featured the huge hit Please Don't GO. Now with his fourth album Now or Never, Tank has not only delivered his best album but one of the best R&B albums of 2010. From the opening  interlude Showtime to the triple punch of the singles Sex Music, Celebration & Emergency there isn't one song on this CD that needs to be skipped over. This is an album for people who appericate real R&B and it's a testament to an artist's talent to have an album with all slow jams which never becomes boring. The central theme of this CD is sex which is evident in the songs Sex Music, Foreplay, Can I and Emergency. However Tank does touch on relationships with Keep it 100 and his excellent cover of I Can't Make You Love Me.

{"text": "Throughout his ten year career as a performer, songwriter and producer, Tank has been both underrated and underpromoted. While he scored a huge hit in 2001 with \"Maybe I Deserve\", his debut album \"Force Of Nature\" was slow to catch on with audiences. On his next album, 2002's \"One Man\" in which he had a repeat of the same occurences. It didn't help matters that he had more success behind the scenes as a writer and producer. After 2003, he decided to put his career on hiatus, then later deciding not wanting to make music anymore- until a talk with actor/fellow musician Jamie Foxx made him change his mind. in 2007, he released his third and final album on the Blackground Records label- 2007's \"Sex Love And Pain\".In 2010, he released \"Now Or Never\" his first on the Atlantic Records label. The production of the album is largely handled by Tank and his production team Song Dynasty. Outside production comes from the Stereotypes (best known for Raheem DeVaughn's \"I Don't Care\") on \"Celebration\" with a scene-stealing guest spot from Drake. Jim Jonsin produces the ballad \"Scream\" while Kevin Barnes hands in the Chris Brown assisted \"Foreplay\". The song \"Emergency\" sounds dangerously close to Pleasure P's \"Under\", a song ironically written and produced by Tank. On most of the songs, the songs are sexually charged- something that sounds awkward on his behalf. Truth be told, Tank's strong point as a singer and songwriter is when he sings about heartbreak- whether he's the victor (See: The ballads \"Keep It 100\" and \"You Mean That Much\"), or the victim (See: His show-stopping cover of the Bonnie Raitt classic \"I Can't Make You Love Me\"). Even though it's nice to see him with a new album, the songs feel rushed and out of focus, which make for a somewhat underwhelming listen. In short, this album could have been a lot better than it was.\n", "val": 5.4343181545846164e-05}

{"text": "I don't know. Maybe my ears been starving for some music like this I dunno. I've been a Tank fan since Force of Nature. I have to say throughout his career he's kept up the consistency. He's always made songs to me that can not only be radio hits or something to dance to in a club, but something you can lay back and unwind to. Music is becoming so, how do i put this, manufactured maybe? Where good artists aren't sticking to what made fans gravitate to them. They're trying to be like the next artist because that artist is currently getting all the radio play, etc. I'm happy to see this guy stick to his guns and continuosly put out a good album. And did i mention no Auto-Tune? I know I say that in all my reviews. Believe me I have nothing against auto-tune. I just think its slowly starting to play out. You know where you sit down and listen to an album and you can't tell the difference from track 1 to 12 because they all sound the same?

I've been kinda fed up with the R&B/Rap collabos; it seems to be all people are doing these days.  I love rap just as much as the next person, but I don't want to hear a rapper on every R&B song or album.  I also don't want to see a special guest appearance on nearly every song on an album.  Tank has put together an album that is as sensual as it is sexual, showing that he can be sexy/explicit while at the same time deliver lyrics that are heartfelt/heartwarming.  \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is already my fav song on the album.  Perhaps some of these other \"artists\" will follow his lead and get back to making some real muzik!\n", "val": 0.0005011977627873421}

{"text": "Tank has always been one of the most overlooked and underrated R&B singers since the 2000's. Though he is an exceptional contemporary R&B singer that has had a small handful of solo hits and modest record sales, he is probably more know for his excellent songwriting and production of other major R&B artists. In a lot of ways, I like to think Tank is kind of like a very very poor man's R. Kelly (Just Speaking in terms of chart success, not Poor Man in terms of talent). Much like R. Kelly, Tank normally writes, produces, plays and sings his own music along with the music he contributes to other artists. He has worked with a extensively long list of grade A R&B singers over the past five years, like Jamie Foxx, Omarion, Donell Jones, Joe, Keith Sweat, Marques Houston, Pleasure P, Fantasia, Keri Hilson, Toni Braxton, Chris Brown, Monica and Day 26 just to name a few... And while Tank has never been a truly standout artist/producer/songwriter, he should be a lot more popular as he makes some of the best modern day R&B music out, weather its his music or someone elses. And while I do think he is very underrated, he has managed to have 4 successful singles, 900,000 records sold amongst his first three solo albums, and he's gotten nominated for four grammy's, two of those nominations were for his own solo music. But even with that very impressive resume, he still tends to get overlooked quite often, and unfortunately I think that trend will continue on this long awaited Now Or Never album...While I'm sure he will have a decent first week sales (His last album, 2007's Sex, Love & Pain managed to move 100,000 in the first week surprisingly), Now Or Never will most likely fall off very fast much like his last album. But never the less, that doesnt detract from his super talent.Like I stated above, Tank has never really had that \"Breakthrough\" success in terms of his solo career. He's one of those artists who has a hit here and there and sells a decent amount of records (Enough to keep him afloat), but never truly breaks into the mainstream for good. The first time people really remember hearing Tank, was probably with his first solo hit, the slow jam ballad \"Maybe I Deserve\", which ended up being his first and only top 40 hit and probably his biggest hit to date. The single was lifted from his 2001 debut album, Force Of Nature, which managed to go gold, probably due to the success of that hit. Now though, Force of Nature has slipped out of print, and is considered a rare collectors item if you can manage to get your hands on a copy. Force of Nature itself though, was honestly a pretty miserable album, which is probably why it only had one hit. It was very awkward and it sounded like Tank didn't really know what he was trying to accomplish with the record. The production was bad, the songwriting was sub-par at best, and the songs were just kind of boring, which is why I'm kind of surprised people are willing to pay upwards of 50 dollars for the album. Besides the two singles and maybe one other track on the album, the rest of the album was very bland. So when it came time for round two from Tank in late 2002, people were definitely skeptical. His second album, 2002's One Man, was unfortunately much to similar to his debut. Again besides the singles (the title track and a party track titled \"Let Me Live\"), there wasn't a whole to offer on the album. Although I will admit, it was a step forward from his last album, as there were at least a few tracks on the album that were worth listening to more than once. But overall, One Man still wasn't up to par with other contemporary R&B albums being released at the time, not even close really. Not to mention the album failed to have even one single achieve chart success, causing the album to flop even harder than his debut. So after his first to albums failed to meet expectations (Critically and Commercially), Tank disappeared for quite a lengthy period of time, although he was still producing and writing for other artists, but he wasn't getting a whole lot of attention for it. Tank didn't resurface in the music industry as a singer again until 2005 when he released a promotional single titled \"I Love Them Girls\", which also went unnoticed, though it was a fantastic stripper anthem lol So in early 2007, when he finally started to make his official comeback as a solo artist with his first single from his third studio album, Sex, Love & Pain, it had felt like he was gone for more than five years, especially since a lot of people didn't even know he released an album back 2002. So needless to say, the anticipation for Sex, Love & Pain was high. Especially since he finally started to get more recognition for his production credits on other artists records, most noteworthy his work on Jamie Foxx's Unpredictable album which ended up being one of the best and most successful albums of 2005/2006. So like I said, expectations were sky high (Including mine). The Sex, Love & Pain album ended up being a pretty successful album for him, especially since the first single \"Please Don't Go\" ended up being one of the more popular R&B singles of the year, and serving as the true comeback record for him earning him two grammy nominations. All in all, Sex, Love & Pain was by far his best album at the time, mostly because his production and songwriting had gotten sooooo much better over that five year gap between albums, probably due to how in demand he was during that time as a producer for other big name R&B artists. Not to mention he was taken in as part of one of the best R&B production teams of the past 10 years, The Underdogs. But with that said, and even though SL&P was his best album, I still can't deny that it was disappointing somewhat. It could have been the sky high expectations, or it could have been the fact that the album itself just wasn't that great still. Don't get me wrong, it definitely wasn't nearly as bad as his first two albums, it wasn't bad at all, but it still felt like it was missing something that made it a truly good or great standout R&B album...So now, three and a half years later, we are in kind of the same spot with his newest album, 2010's Now Or Never. Tank has had a tendency to take his sweet time with his albums, especially his two most recent albums. So if Tank has perfected anything in his 10 year run in the music business, its that he has learned how to form very high anticipation for his albums. Just like Sex, Love & Pain, Now Or Never's expectations and anticipation was sky high after a three and a half year wait for the album, and over two years worth of push backs and leaks. This album has gone through it's fair share of modifications, in fact, its probably nothing like what the first original tracklisting suggested it to be. Now Or Never's original title was Sex, Love & Pain II: The All Night Experience, and it was intended to be released on his original label Blackground Records. But with almost the entire album leaked to the net before there was even a single released for the album, and a decreasing album budget with an already sinking label in Blackground, in early 2009 Tank decided to jump ship and take his talents to the SUPER label Atlantic Records, which i fully supported seeing it as he would probably finally get some good promotion and a good album budget (I mean have any of you seen the music video for his huge 2007 single \"Pleas Don't Go\" from Blackground records??? Talk about a low budget video). So he scrapped the entire Sex, Love & Pain II album in summer of 09, and started working on a totally new record, to be titled...you guessed it, Now Or Never. So in summer of 2010 when the rare up tempo banger/baby maker \"Sex Music\" was released as the first single to lukewarm ratings and chartings, the album was again pushed back from it's September 21st release date, to a November 2nd release, making the anticipation grow even more. And I honestly don't understand how \"Sex Music\" was such a flop on the charts, because it had everything Tank would have needed to have a radio smash...it had banging club beat, seductive lyrics, and instantly catchy hook, not to mention the song was just flat out great and super addictive. So honestly I was glad that the single floppped, because I just didn't want it to get over played on the radio, and \"Sex Music\" ended up serving more as a promo single than an actual single. But then unfortunately, the album got pushed back yet again, this time to a December 14th release date. The second single released was a typical Tank ballad about heartbreak in \"Emergency\", which was another great classic Tank track, that reminded a lot of fans and critics alike of Pleasure P's baby maker \"Under\", which coincidentally was also produced by Tank. And again, similar to \"Sex Music\", \"Emergency\" never really gained any steam on the charts, so far peaking at number 47 on the R&B charts, which signifies another failed single for Tank's Now Or Never album...But at least it didn't get pushed back this time, and now the album has finally arrived. And after just one listen I could immediately tell that it was by far Tank's best album. What seperates Now Or Never from Tank's previous albums, is the production and the vibe of the album. On Tank's previous records, like I stated earlier, the production and songwriting had a tendency to be bland at times (Actually more often than not), causing his previous albums to drag in some parts. But on Now Or Never he steps up not only his production, but his contributors also bring their A game. Like on \"Scream\", the Jim Jonsin produced piano tinged ballad about screaming, and not just sexually, is definitely a standout. And on the smooth babymaker \"Amazing\", Tank uses his soft falsetto to caress the gentle beat, and what Tank claims to be his favorite track on the album \"Can I\", is also another extremely steamy baby maker and probably the best song on the album, which if played at the right moment it's promised someone will become pregnant. And the mid tempo acoustic driven \"Keep It 100\" is another standout heartbreak ballad, produced by Tank and his production team Song Dynasty, who dominates the production on the record. And the Drake assisted mid tempo club banger \"Celebration\", produced by R&B duo The Stereotypes, is probably Tank's last hope for a hit single on this Now Or Never album, as its probably one of the more catchy songs on the album. The cover of Bonnie Rait's love ballad \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" is also surprisingly another standout, as Tank makes the track his own with his amazing vocals on the track. Thats another thing I want to point out about this record, is that vocally Tank has never sounded better than he does on this album. His smooth vocals just glide across all of these tracks almost effortlessly, making it very clear as to why I have always thought Tank has one of the best most mature contemporary R&B voices among the rather large group of modern day R&B singers. All in all, Now Or Never isn't going to be the best album of the year by any means, nor will it have any sort of tremendous chart success either, but it's the first Tank album that there isn't an ounce of disappointment in me about the record. It's the first Tank album to truly meet and exceed my expectations, which i was honestly starting to become skeptical if he would ever be able to give us a truly great or even a solidly good contemporary R&B album, after his first three records were mediocre at best. But it's finally happended, and Now Or Never proves that Tank is more than just a excellent producer/songwriter, he is also an excellent solo R&B artist.Grade:B\n", "val": 0.0005541437421925366}

And he's not alone, he brings along the current cats Drake, Chris Brown, and his own cat, new artist J. Valentine for the ride.The opening track, \"Showtime\", starts it off by Tank getting the listener ready for what's about to come.\"Sex Music\", the first single, delivers with a sexy bassline for the party people, Tank proves that he can be current here.\"Celebration\", the next single, with its smooth beat, finger-snapping, telling to celebrate love-making with your loved one. And of course, Drake is featuring in this track, too (since Tank is one his favorites)\"Emergency\", the second single. In this song, Tank saving a woman in distress before it's too late.In \"Scream\", Tank shares different ways to scream; when you're fed up or when making love.\"Keep It l00\" - a phrase meaning \"keep it real with me\", \"tell me the truth\". Tank sings about telling the truth.In \"Foreplay\", this is when Tank shines. Seductive beats, sensual lyrics, this track has it all with Chris Brown assisting.There's a burning desire, heat and passion in the next track, \"Can I\". Tank delivers what the listener wants to hear without being too cheesy, too corny or too perverted - just sensual and raw. It'll be reminiscent of what Teddy Pendergrass, Ron Isley, Marvin Gaye or Barry White used to set the mood off right.\"Amazing\" is a beautiful track and one of the highlights. With Tank's lushful vocals soaring through the listener's ears, this track is suitable for a night out with a loved one.\"You Mean That Much\" is stripped-down R&B at finest.His version of \"I Can't Make Love Me\" - another stripped-down R&B track - is beautiful, a well-done version of the track.Bonus Tracks:\"On My Way\" is solid as well and J. Valentine isn't bad either. He reminds me of Bobby Valentino when he first came out.The beginning of \"Let Me Know\" might confused you at first with its bass thumping but when the music stars, it makes sense.

{"text": "This is a great & fantastic CD release by the talented, prolific singer-songwriter & King of R n' B, Robert Kelly, titled, \"Love Letter\". This Great CD opens with \"Love Letter (Prelude)\", a beautiful & soulful 'al cappella' track, voicing being greatful for the support he received during his recent troubles with the law & as well as more about the great music in this CD. \"Love Letter\" is the next great track : great drum kit sound, laid-back track with great vocals (title track). \"Love Letter Christmas\" is great remix of the title track. \"Number One Hit\" is another great track (electro-R n' B track, great bass/drums combination & great clear vocals). Other great tracks include \"Just Can't Get Enough\" (soul sound & soulful vocals), \"Radio Message\" (Great vocals & very persuasive lyrics, singer pleading very convincingly, \"Baby come back\"), \"Love Is\" (great vocals & harmonies, featuring K. Michelle) & \"You Are Not Alone\" (a hidden track on my CD, great effort & interpretation by Robert Kelly of the classic song he wrote for Michael Jackson, a well fitting tribute to the great fallen musician. His vocals don't fully match Michael Jackson's, but is nevertheless a great effort, tribute & his own interpretation of the this great song). Good tracks include \"Not Feelin' The Love\", \"Taxi Cab\", \"Just Like That\" (great guitar intro & bass/drum combination) & \"Music Must Be A Lady\" (great orchestral intro, the track starts quite greatly but does fail to keep its greatness as it goes on). \"Lost In Your Love\" is a solid track/gem : a beautiful grand piano sound, fantastic melody, wonderful bass/drum combination, great chorus, harmonies & lyrics. He declares \"Baby tonight I wanna be lost in your love\", very convincingly. \"When  A Women Loves\" is another solid track/gem : probably inspired by Percy Sledge's classic, \"When A Man Loves A Woman\". The song has a beautiful melody, great high pitched vocals & persuasive lyrics. He proclaims a woman, \"She loves for real... She fills my soul\". \"How Do I Tell Her?\" is a masterpiece of a song : beautiful orchestral background/base track, very melodical, 'heartbreaking' lyrics & vocals. The song also has well matched rhythm guitar, grand piano & a nice saxophone near the end. The singer fading singing, \"Bye bye baby...bye bye baby...\", what a gem of a song! This is my favourite track from this fantastic CD & hence the title of my review. This great CD has no weak track to really talk of.

{"text": "This album feels like sincere conversation with good old friend who has gone through series of great romantic relationships, great sexual experiences and some hardships of the break-ups. All you gotta do is sit down, listen, enjoy and live vicariously through the stories ... and of course admire this amazing talent. It's very exciting, FUN - FUN - FUN and up-lifting \"conversation\". The tone is awesome. Love-songs can be dull, desperate and boring at times. Personally I was never fan of a over-the-top romance. It comes off as cheesy at times. These songs are far from that. They are pure fun and JOY. It's not an easy thing to pull off. I can't imagine skipping a song - I play album from start to finish everytime. Every single song has its own \"personality\" and different from each other. Album inlay has Mr. R. Kelly credited for words, music and production for every single song. If that is not the talent, I don't know what is. Hat's off to His Excellence.001. Love Letter Prelude - Cool intro and great set-up for the mood the rest of the album.002. Love Letter - Title track, great love song and solid single.003. Number One Hit - True gem and my personal favorite.004. Not Feelin' The Love - Hint of \"hot getting cold\" and beautiful melody.005. Lost In Your Love - Love-song with lower tone.006. Just Can't Get Enough - Love-song with up-beat tone.007. Taxi Cab - Clean version of sex story told in 4 minutes.008. Radio Message - Another great single! This is the song that radio station has played and got me interested in hearing the album. I love powerful vocals. Another one that is personal favorite ...009. When A Woman Loves - Great single, amazing vocals and lyrics.010. Love Is (featuring K. Michelle) - One duet-treat and great choice of female vocal. It has Motown-sound feel to it and it's a great tribute to that era.011. Just Like That - Pure fun - very up-beat and in-the-moment ... just great song.012. Music Must Be A Lady - Classic and timeless feel to this one - definite highlight on the album.013. A Love Letter Christmas - Great Christmas version of hit title song. It's same track with same choruses but verses are completely re-written to fit Christmas \"sound\" with really cool \"free-style\" rap. New Christmas classic is born here.014. How Do I Tell Her? - I love this song. The guy singing the song is man-in-charge. Another personal favorite ...hidden track: You Are Not Alone - Greatest homage to MJ and brilliant way to close the album. This was MJ's number one hit and was always indisputably song written by R. Kelly. Song isn't changed too much from what we have heard from MJ previously. In the line \"Everyday I sit and ask myself ...\" R. Kelly uses \"aks\" instead of \"ask\" - great substitute that seems spontaneous and ultra-cool.The album has classic and timeless quality - from the cover to the sound. The whole package is done really well with coolness and good taste. It also kicks a$$!!! We can hear a guy who is full of emotions, he is all man and he is in the charge of this love affairs.

{"text": "I remember being so excited when this album dropped. I can't believe I forgot to write a review; I could've sworn I did... Anyway, this is so refreshing to hear. A throwback album full of great soul/R&B (that isn't just full of covers... sorry Boyz)! People must have forgot or been turned off by all the media hoopla, but R. Kelly is one of the best R&B artists ever! He makes this sound classic, yet I still feel like its clearly fresh, new music. I love how he pulled that off while paying tribute to greats such as Otis Redding, Stevie Wonder, up to Michael Jackson. And he still did it his way. Hey, who better to sing \"You Are Not Alone\" (a bonus track) than R. Kelly? He wrote and produced the original song anyway! \"When a Woman Loves\" is a fantastic display of his voice and appreciation for women. Seeing him perform it live is even better... SMH... I can't believe it. One of teh best male vocal performances I have ever heard. Despite me being a big R. Kelly fan, I don't even think I'm exaggerating. The title track is a great dance song that also has (OMG) MEANING to it. The rhythm and melody to Love Letter is infectious and soulful. \"I'm Not Feeling the Love\" is a sincere, poignant song about what it feels like when you think you've lost the love and romance in your life and relationship. There are so many good songs here.Man, the instrumentation, the rhythms, the lyrics, production and vocal performances on this album are top notch. Also, in case you didn't already figure it out, it's not full of garbage \"R&B\" that tries to cater to young, immature rap fans. R. Kelly has put out some lackluster material the past few years, no lie, and it would kill me every time. Aside from a few highlights, forget TP3, Double Up and the like. The man is better than trying to get high, drunk and silly with all these new jacks as if he were 21 years old. He proved it with this album. He's better. He's back. He can make seriously touching music that will make you want to dance, reminisce, cry, feel romantic, and... just anything associated with real R&B/soul music. I can't go on enough about this album. This was really great, and it deserved a much better reception and more anticipation than it got. This is the realness right here. This is R. Kelly. Love Letter. GET IT.P.S.

He is such a talented artist, but never would I have expected a recording like this to come from him!  From start to finish, this disc is awesome!

{"text": "R. Kelly's late 2010 release is quite spectacular. The vibe, the lyrics and the lack of his lusty rhymes prove to be the ever more sexy. The track \"Music Must Be A Lady\" (the true highlight of the bunch) proves just that and attracts me like no other track on the album. It has a certain innocent sparkle to it and makes you truly feel as if you're a fan trying to look in on one of your favorite singers. The delivery is that clever. Other mainstays are \"Love Letter\", \"Just Like That\" and the bouncy, Christmas-y \"Love Is\". Likewise, Robert also ambitiously (and quite successfully) covers the late Michael Jackson's classic single \"You Are Not Alone\". It's no surprise that it sounds just as (if not more) inspired because R. Kelly wrote it for Michael to record. The only misstep on the album is the boring \"How Do I Tell Her\" which is four minutes and twenty-three seconds too long.

Several songs are entirely carried along by his voice only, otherwise would have been modestly received as nothing special.  A few obvious hits also deserve lots of praise.  The production is quite smart and lets Kelly rule which is spot-on.  Minor objections: the message is somewhat forced (incessantly insisting on the `love' aspect), the lyrics is occasionally from time past (`love letter'), and the cover is sort of stupid / misleading.  Although this sound is not what I would normally be so interested in, I strongly recommend this piece and consider it overall one of best releases last year.\n", "val": 0.018309298902750015}
{"text": "I had never listened or payed enough attention to this awesome artist by the name of R. Kelly. It was not until 2010 that I bought this CD and 12 Play (12 Play came to me in the mail) that truly understood what I was missing by just listening to that un-experienced but skilled Trey Songz guy. Only to discover the awesomeness of Kells. This is alittle different in sound and mood than his older albums, it has a vibe to that seems appropriate for a coffee shop/open Mic night rather than a rowdy club or a large concert, what I mean is it's tempo sounds more adult-contemporary than that of thumping hip-hop beats. My very favorite songs are \"Number One Hit\" - catchy, nice vocals, \"Not Feelin' the Love\" - slower in pace than Number 1 Hit but very listenable, \"Just Can't Get Enough\" - one of the best tracks, \"Just Like That\" - catchy and great for jamming to/it is not a slow jam/ but a smexy fast jam instead/, and \"Music Must Be a Lady\" - is this Marvin Gaye? great song.\n", "val": 0.020413976162672043}

{"text": "R. Kelly is the best R&B artist of our time, hands down. Just when other artists steal his style and try to call it their own, he reinvents himself and takes us on another trip in his whimsical, diverse and elaborate musical world. He is so talented and this album is a testimony to that fact. This is a CD that you can pop in the CD player and drive. Or you can have a glass of wine and sit back and chill. My favorite tracks are #1 Hit, Not Feeling the Love, When a Woman Loves, Love Letter, etc. It's great. I hate that his reputation has been tarnished but even still, he will go down in history as one of the greatest recording artists of all time off of sheer talent alone. Unlike so many artists today, he can write, arrange, produce and sing. He's not just a mic holder. Kudos to the R in R&B for keeping it moving and keeping us coming back for more.\n", "val": 0.0420820415019989}

{"text": "There are a lot of things that I can say about this album, but I will try to keep it as short as possible, but I can't make any promises. Here we go.Love Letter, for me, is just a beautiful album all around. There are no wasted tracks on this CD, and for good reason; this CD has CLASSIC written all over it. It has a mix of old school R&B sound with new R&B sounds. It's hard to mix old school and new school; it can be done, but it has to be done right; Mr. Kelly got it right.Every single track is just beautiful; from Love Letter to How Do I Tell Her? (there is also a hidden bonus track), and every track is perfected with Kelly's vocals, perfected sound, and message. It is not filled with standard pop-beats, pop-sound, or pop message; everything is laid-down to perfection to create not only the best R&B album of 2010, but also the BEST R&B album of my generation.R.Kelly definitely pays tribute to people that have come before him; Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, Luther Vandross, and the list goes on. It shows here with tracks like 'Radio Message', and 'When A Woman Loves'; both of those tracks have a old school feeling to it, and I can't tell you how good it feels to listen to a song that came out in 2010 that has the old school sound to it, and done right.R.Kelly has been in the music game for 20 years, and he has definitely re-invented himself with this album. Everything about this album is just classic. R.Kelly breaks away from the crowd and makes an album that blows away the competition; he is the best of the best in R&B, and it definitely shows. Can't recommend it enough.\n", "val": 0.0406583771109581}

I purchased this album after seeing a 1 hour special on the making of the album and was compelled to buy it. 2 of the songs are reminiscent of Michael Jackson and I have to wonder if he wrote them for him prior to MJ's death.

And his style is usually distinctive.The more i listened to this new release, the more i liked it.If you like \"old school\" and romance, you'll like it.

There was only one song \"Taxi cab\" thattruly focused on sex, and it's  not really explicit. But, i gave this cdfour stars rather than five because Kelly held back. He did not put his allin to the songs. They are really good! But, he is not the Kelly of old.His heart, soul, full spirit was missing. Perhaps because of the legalwoes he's endured. That may be why he focused on romance, and shyed awayfrom the sexual. My very favorite song is \"Just like that!\" I could trulyhear the \"old\" R. Kelly!

Perhaps this white-boy is living vicariously, but.... That said, \"Love Letter,\" his new CD is a wonderful \"PG\" collection of love songs (wow, what a clever title, hum?) Mr. Kelly is not verbally undressing, caressing or sexing this time. Instead, he is poetically making love through smart lyrics, cleaver music and the emotions of a life lived with other souls.I cannot imagine a song better than, \"When A Woman Love.\" Musically simple, the words define the pain of love and the joy of love. Could this supplant \"When A Man Loves A Woman?\" Do Al Green and Marvin Gaye have competition? Are couples, coupling each time this disc is played? To paraphrase Sarah Pallin, \"You betcha!\"R Kelly's CD photos are a compellation of Ray Charles and Frank Sinatra. A more innocent 1960's is suggested when sexual conquest was unadvertised, but nonetheless ever-present. Forget the literal panty dropping of his previous efforts or the graphic verbosity of his piers Lil' Wayne and Drake and step back a few decades to learn how a real woman could be seduced by a line, a note and a gentle voice.What a joy that I can finally admit to friends and family that I like the new R Kelly disc.

I agree it's worth purchasing, but new fans should see the R. album or TP-2.com, or otherwise, the self-titled `95 CD or finally Chocolate Factory...or even Happy People/U Saved me. Yes He has that many great releases, you're afforded such wide selectivity in your introduction, that it's literally YOUR CHOICE!...and frankly I had yet mentioned 12 Play. Kelly Rocks! He's an incredible artist. Any ways On \"Love letter\" his vocals show TOO MUCH AUTO-TUNE, it's really a distraction (if not detraction). There also are not as many standout songs as these crazed reviews from obviously delirious fans (probably casual fans who are suddenly amazed, or desperate ones...one or the other) The songs \"Radio Message\" is great, as well as \"When A Woman Loves\" & \"Love Is\". The song \"Just Like That\" trails in the very order I mention each and ironically, it shares the title to an earlier R.Kelly song featured on the `01 era release TP-2.com (this song is much better than the song of the same name on Love Letter). The concluding song and bonus track is the re-recorded version of The Royal One's \"You Are Not Alone\" (although well-documented, R.kelly wrote the song), and let me just say that the best thing Robert did with this song is send it to Michael. This is not a good cover, but it's so connected to Michael...NO ONE COULD MAKE IT SOUND GOOD, SO MUCH. What would've been interesting is R.Kelly offering us the original now very-historic demo that he used to pitch the song to MJ!!!!So I give the CD a 3/5, maybe it will age better but I don't believe so.

{"text": "I remember when R. Kelly first appeared with Public Announcement back in the day. I almost wrote him off as a second-rate Aaron Hall clone (of the group \"GUY\") since they both came out during the height of the New Jack Swing period of 90's R&B. From his second release \"12 Play\" onward, as an artist R. Kelly has confounded and sometimes aggravated me deeply. On the one hand there's that Bump-&-Grind, Thug Playah persona, which appeals to most R&B fans who came of age in the 90's and then there's that persona that can craft a gospel-tinged tune like \"I Believe I Can Fly\", a club bouncer like \"Home Alone\", steppers classics like \"Step In The Name Of Love\" & \"Happy People\", or classic old-school flavored songs like \"When A Woman's Fed Up\", or a contemporary \"begging\" anthem such as \"I Can't Sleep\". As an artist he didn't appear so much as versatile, but a musically schizophrenic shill pandering to the buck. For example, Prince, before his Jehovah's Witness conversion, could seemly transition from a licentiously dark sex freak to a metaphysical musical wonder and you could still sense the Prince's integrity and commitment to musical craft. the worse you could expect from Prince is him going off on some abstract tangent that nobody but Prince could comprehend. Up until lately, you often had to wonder just how low R. Kelly would sink, before he'd crank out another anthemic song in an effort to convince you he wasn't the child-stalking pedophile his court cases insinuated he was.No doubt, the man has an almost unparalleled sense of hip-hop/pop craftsmanship and what will sell. But his music ... from TP2.com forward seemed to be just a little too calculated for my tastes. The contradicting irony is that I either have entire CDs or tunes from every release he's done up until Double-Up. And while most people would crown him the \"King of R&B\", I won't ... despite his obvious sales and track record. I will concede that his influence on 90's and first decade 2000's R&B is undeniable. I admit that having been weaned on the real masters of R&B: Marvin, Smokey, Sam Cooke, Luther, Peabo and groups Like the O'Jays, The Tempts, The Stylistics, The Spinners, The Dramatics ... people with a level of elegance, sincerity and class. R. Kelly and his hip-hop infused, thug-flavored  brand of R&B seemed to be the antithesis of what I consider REAL R&B was all about. In the 90's, it was as if any male R&B singer who wasn't singing in an R. Kelly vein, he was considered \"soft\" and unmarketable. And in truth, with a few exceptions, most of R. Kelly's \"soft\" contemporaries during that period ... with a few notable exceptions (Joe, Gerald Levert, Keith Sweat, Usher) ... their careers floundered and they disappeared from the scene.Too many times R. Kelly ... IMO ... appeared more concerned about commercial sales than any heartfelt commitment to high-quality musical content. Even though R. Kelly had some admittedly memorable and enjoyable stellar departures from his standard modus operandi of gangsta-seasoned bedroom music. But to me they were finely crafted, million-selling hiccups. From where I sit, the whole \"neo-soul\" trend producing Musiq Soulchild, Maxwell, and Raheem Devaughn was a direct retort to the salacious Bump-&-Grind, Sex-Me road of \"Rubbish & Bullcrap\" R. Kelly and his clones had steered the genre down and almost killed it. And all of that flack with his sex crime charges certainly didn't endear me to his music. By the time \"Double-Up\" came out, I declared I was done with R. Kelly. It seemed like all he was capable of producing were thug anthems fit for strip clubs. Kicking Ne-Yo out of his tour back in 2008 really ticked me off ... I was done with the \"Peed Piper of R&B\". When his \"Untitled\" released came out 2 years ago, I listened to the \"Religious\" cut with amused contempt; typical calculating R. Kelly single!But at this point in my long-winded polemic (seemingly) hating on R. Kelly, I have to say that \"Love Letter\" is a release truly deserving the 4-star rating I'm giving it. The obvious calculated decision to hearken back to and pay homage to 60's & 70's soul is why I'm stingy with that 5th star. I have plenty of 4 & 5-star rated R. Kelly singles in my music collection, but as far as whole CDs, only his first four releases (\"Born Into The 90's, R., & R. Kelly\") were worthy of a rating from me higher than 3 stars.\"Love Letter\" is probably the first R. Kelly release I can say I like without qualifying it. It's also the first R. Kelly release in a long time that I don't have to wince at if my teenaged daughter were have it on her mp3 player. The title cut and \"Love Letter Christmas\" radiate with authentic sincerity. I have only 3 criticisms of this CD. #1. The cut \"When A Woman Loves\" though good as a \"testifying\" tribute to a woman's devotion, does sound a bit contrived. Anybody old enough to have heard Gene Chandler's live version of his 1965 cut \"Rainbow\" or Marvin Gayes' 1974 live version of \"Distant Lover\" will know what I'm talking about. Those R&B icons practiced a level of on-stage authentic testifying and begging R. Kelly has yet to achieve ... athough ... R. puts out a great vocal facsimile of their intensity. #2. If I didn't know better, I'd almost swear R. Kelly looked at/listened to Raphael Saadiq's 2008 release \"The Way I See It\" and said \"hmmm ... that's what I'll do next... a retro-release!\" And while Raphael Saadiq's \"The Way I See It\" sounds more organic and true to the period it pays homage to, \"Love Letter\" oozes with R. Kelly's slick studio production technique, though still evoking the era in a very admirable fashion.Thanks to \"Love Letter\", I'm (temporarily) suspending my epithets of \"The Peed Piper of Rubbish & Bullcrap\" where R. Kelly is concerned. That is ... until he pi$$e$ me off with another set of thug-nificent ghetto anthems. I sincerely hope R. Kelly continues with this level of artistry.\n", "val": 7.738808926660568e-05}

Now he's grown-up (one would hope-it's past time) and created material  that best showcases his God given gift that will endure until 20 yrs. from now some reviewer of advanced age writes \"well,this new kid is okay...but he ain't no R kelley!\"\n", "val": 0.02696250192821026}

{"text": "R Kelly's Love letter can be summed into one word. \"Revelation\". Many people for a long time have been waiting for R Kelly to make an album like this where he shows some substance. On this album he just does that. This by far has been his most substantial album of his career and the lyrics along with the fine production prove just that. But this by no means is no nod to classic albums and should not be compared to thoseThe production says everything and the instrumentation says everything. Albums back in those days were done with live bands and real instruments, not with Midi instruments, drum kits, and sound effects. Also keep in mind the rhythm and the melodies are also different as well. But Kelly makes a great attempt at trying to bridge the gap between the past and the future with this album. But most of the songs on the album don't show that comparison. All I hear are his usual beats and sound laid down with different and more heartfelt lyrics. But Like I said this is by far the best album of his career. This album will appeal to the younger crowd because of it's familiarity in the production. But I have always said that Kelly has an average voice but he is a great producer and writer. No one can take that away from him.\n", "val": 0.025711193680763245}

{"text": "\"Dear Ladies it's your boy January\"... thus begins the introduction of his love letter to the ladies and to the world. Returning back to the roots of R&B this album embodies the art of love, the act of loving, and sinful decadent orchestration of falling in love through music. No cursing, no dogging out each other, no vulgarity, no offenses, just plain loving rapturous music. Every song on this album represents the music that R.Kelly grew up with such as, the Isley Brothers, Michael Jackson, Sam Cooke, Sade and others.  I noticed that there were a few negative comments about this album but let me put your fears to rest. If you are a true fan of R&B and have experienced its triumphs and losses and lately within the past 7 years there have been many loses than this is an album for you. Give it a chance after awhile it does start to sink in it is very relaxing especially if you are at the office or on the way home from a long day at work.  For the young generation this music might not be to your taste I too am from this era and will listen to Trey Songz, Ciara, Beyonce, and others however the music of R&B is sorely lacking and it is because we do not have artists that can sing but importantly create love songs. And that is because we are young and don't really understand love. Our interpretation has been sullied by the media and class less hip hop and gutterly R&B for the past 7 years we can't even tell what is good music anymore. But I urge you to listen to how R.Kelly sings, how he talks about loving a woman and loving your man without the stress of greed and selfishness. Every song in this album is excellent and I encourage you to listen with an open mind and heart. I can't wait for him to go on tour.\n", "val": 0.00853230245411396}

If you really want to know, listen to two classic R&B albums by him: \"Chocolate Factory\" and this very album I am reviewing, \"Love Letter.\" After listening to these LP's, I guarantee you will be blow away as I was. He is gifted in every sense of the word. He reminds me somewhat of Prince because he writes, produces and arranges his music and he plays instruments. He and Prince have mastered the art of music. They have taken each aspect of it, studied it and mastered each aspect effortlessly.\"Love Letter\" is certainly one of those \"just press play\" records. There is no filler and these are not just songs, they are hits. Worth mentioning is the fact that these songs sound like they could have been included on Kelly's \"Happy People\" LP. The songs just sound a lot like the tracks on that album. \"When a Woman Loves\" was the first song released to radio. It was a fine choice because, if nothing else, Kelly's vocals will command your attention. The lyrics are heartfelt and honest. The lyrics are profound without being esoteric. The chorus says, \"when a woman loves, she loves for real.\" Indeed, R. Kelly, indeed. \"Number One Hit\" is another hit with replay value. What great production, smooth melody and nice lyrics. Undoubtedly, the most special moment on this LP is the last track. The song is called \"You Are Not Alone.\" Kelly had written this song for Michael Jackson and he performs it here. One can't help but to get choked up. Kelly does a fine job with his rendition.Do yourself a favor and add this to your collection. A lot of the music that is out there currently is trash that will not last beyond this season. R. Kelly easily transcends bubblegum pop and brings us real R&B. *Sigh of relief* At last.Mikeisha's Top 51. \"Number One Hit\"2. \"Just Can't Get Enough\"3. \"You Are Not Alone\"4. \"Love Is\"5. \"Love Letter\"\n", "val": 0.03146093338727951}
{"text": "R. Kelly stated that when he turns the radio on, he hears a lot of artists that are influenced heavily by his style and have taken on his style as their own. So his concern when working on his 11th studio album was that when the younger generation heard his music, they might think that he is biting the style of the younger artists instead of knowing that it is actually the other way around so...he went in a totally different direction with \"Love Letter\" and it was a genius idea!\"Love Letter\" is a classic soul/R&B album!  From track one till the end, you will hear the undeniable influence of Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Motown, all wrappped up in the \"6-1' vessel named R. Kelly.

{"text": "Hard to believe this guy is already in the middle of his second decade in music! In his some eighteen years of recording history he's taken us down some very interesting and often innovative roads and,unfortunately some controversial ones as well. When it seemed that he'd gotton lost on his musical path on the releases following his excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Chocolate-Factory/dp/B00007E8J1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chocolate Factory</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Happy-People-U-Saved-Me/dp/B0001VOHH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Happy People / U Saved Me</a>,both albums that were able to effectively blend some of the modern musical stylings with the melodic and rhythm textures of 70's and early 80's funk/R&B/disco he released this album that shows in every respect that the muse that inspired the creation of those two excellent albums is not only very much still there but still has enough room within it to grow and develop.  From the cover art to the music this album actually is a fitting tribute not only to \"retro\" styles of R&B,funk and soul but has the advantage of maintaining that flavor throughout,without the addition of hip-hop guest stars and any variation of that \"\"WHOA HO WHOA HO\" chant over a digitized beat\" style of contemporary R&B that has long since become overused even by Kelly himself. The title song,\"Lost In Your Love\",\"Just Can't Get Enough\",\"Radio Message\" and the Chrisette Michelle duet of \"Love Is\" all are heavily indebted to that sound that bought the \"stepping\" revival into play during 2003/2004 and represents a style that works extremely well for R.Kelly's style of singing,writing and lyricism-which here represents a turn toward elaborately chorded melodies and passionately sung lyrics that showcase a great deal of maturity and outward realization about love and life that the typically lustfull R.Kelly often skims over and/or ignores. The only time that (sort of) shows up is on the lusty \"Taxi Cab\" which is also the closest thing this album gets to contemporary.  Another highlite of this album is the light jazz-funk flavor of \"Number One Hit\",which finds Kelly in his classic style comparing a lady to music by Michael Jackson and Sade and (even though not credit) the harmony vocals of the hook sound a lot like Sade in fact. The latter half of the album showcases Kelly putting a spin on the 60's Motown/Vee-Jay style of soul balladeering (with the JB influenced mixed in) on \"When A Woman Loves\",\"Music Must Be A Lady\" and \"How Do I Tell Her\". Even though this style of R&B would've seemed retro even in the 70's they showcase a very decent and human outlook on romance that speaks to Kelly's more mature state of mind at this time and aware as I am of the duel sides of his romantic/sexual outlook I can only hope that this is more an outlook on the future than yet another sidebar. The album ends with his own version of \"You Are Not Alone\",a song so linked with Michael Jackson that people tend to forget R.Kelly wrote it.  So all and all,considering the high level of musical and production quality that went into it this album might be looked at as a runner up for R.Kelly's most impressive overall album. Now fans of his more sexually aggressive hip-hop/R&B style of music will not find exactly what they're looking for on this album. But this album actually eludes lyrically to the fact that what constitutes for radio airplay has grown steadily more shallow over the years which,of course leads to a certain amount of self commentary in this case. One can only hope that the twin sides of R.Kelly's nature have reconcilled themselves to the point where him producing music of this quality can become the rule as opposed to the exception but we will just have to see what happens when his next album comes out.\n", "val": 0.006330385338515043}

It's funny how even \"Taxi Cab\" with its featured electric guitar fits well on the CD as he dips his toe in rock music. And his dedication to Michael Jackson with his rendition of \"You Are Not Alone\" is beautiful. With 'Love Letter', R.

{"text": "There's no doubt that R. Kelly is in a class by himself when it comes to R&B music. I can still recall being twelve years old and slow dancing to Honey Love. R. Kelly has always had a central theme in his music which his sex, however every album is his catalog would always truly show his vocal talent.  After Chocolate Factory, R. Kelly began to release mediocre discs which would only have its share of good songs. This was most evident on Happy People , TP3 & Double Up and most recently Untitled. I almost wrote R. Kelly off as someone who would never reclaim me a diehard fan since or starters,  Kells is 44 and no one wants  to hear him singing auto tune. Now R. Kelly has released an album that I can let play from beginning to end. Love Letter is the type of album that R. Kelly should have started making a while ago.  Love Letter is the best R. Kelly album since Chocolate Factory and it features songs about love and not just sex.  As a matter of fact, the only sexual song on the disc is Taxi Cab which has more in common with The Greatest Show On Earth from Happy People then say Feelin On Ya Booty from TP2.  Two of the strongest ballads Radio Message & the lead single When A Woman Loves would make the late greats Sam Cooke, Luther Vandross and Marvin Gaye proud. While Love Letter, Number One Hit and Music Must Be A Lady just make you want to grab your lady and dance. I do wish that Kelly had included some of the outtakes from the aborted Loveland disc of 2002 such as Somethings Never Change, Kiss You In The Places & You Bring Me Joy. In addition  two of the strongest songs from Untitled disc, Religious & Elsewhere would be welcome on this disc. All in all this is a great album and along with the recently released  Eric Benet disc Lost In Time and 2008's Raphael Saadiq The Way I See It that pay tribute to R&B music. The only song I didn't care for was his cover of You Are Not Alone.

I will say I wasn't too excited about the release of Love Letter, Kelly can get lost in all the teenage drama (sexing in the club and feeling on bootys, etc) but I was very pleasently surprised with this release. This is his thank you to the fans that have sustained him and he treats us right.  I disagree that this album is his best EVA, I don't even agree that it is better than Chocolate Factory / Loveland but I will say this is the first album that I believe he pulled off a nice mix of music to fulfill both his young and young at heart fans. I put this CD on repeat (though I skip Taxi Cab)and I can just go for hours and never realized it has started over several times.

{"text": "It is amazing that R. Kelly has sustained himself for twenty years.  He definitely understands what it takes to make music that is not only trendsetting, but also food for the soul.  With his new cd, \"Love Letter\", R. Kelly has taken the time to give us a feel good cd.  It is the type of cd that you will want to bump from the beginning to the end.  I know I cannot get enough of \"Number One Hit\" or \"Not Feeling the Love.\"  Those two tracks makes me want to get on the dance floor and grab a partner and two step.  Though \"When a Woman Loves\" gives me a piece of Sam Cooke and \"Love Is\" feels like Marvin and Tammi are back together again. \"Taxi Cab\" unleashes a little of R.Kelly's freaky side, but with a lil discretion. And, \"Love Letter\" has the original and Christmas versions which will get you on the floor.  Last but not least, \"Radio Message\" is giving a dedication to his baby..only Kels.  All and all, R.Kelly has done it again.  He has given us his metaphoric talent, lessons in love and life, and how to feel good.  If you ready, then definitely go out and buy this cd.  It is not the freakiness of 12 Play or TP2, but his re-edition of old school with a hint of stepping and a whole lot of Kels is worth every bit. \"Dear ladies, dear ladies...it's your boy R.

{"text": "I always loved R Kelly, and have always considered him an extremely gifted artist. His albums have been great over the years, and he has shown himself to be a truly gifted singer aswell as musician, writer and producer. So who would have thought that with this latest album he would not only cement himself as a true genious in the same catagory as Prince or Michael Jackson, but deliver not only the best work of his career but quite simply the most amazing album of the last ten years. Yes people it is that good! This album was a revalation to me on first listen. I haven't felt an album on this level since I first heard `Purple Rain' or first heard Marvin Gaye sing!In a climate of `American Idol' karaoke singers, and endless artists doing cover albums and somehow trying to pass it off as inspired, R Kelly has done what none of them have. He has delivered an album which lends a nod to the likes of Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, but with his own flavour and which never once sounds like he's trying to imitate. There are songs, like `Music must be a Lady' which were obviously influenced heavily by Marvin Gaye's `Just to keep you Satisfied', but not once does it ever sound forced.And that voice! R Kelly has never sounded better. The truly classy vocals and harmonies are quite mesmerizing. And every now and then you could swear you hear Marvin or Michael or Stevie, but the difference between this and an idol ripoff is that R Kelly breathes this sound!In a long career that has had a mix of great albums and, quite frankly, bloated self serving material, who ever thought that he would deliver this incredible album at this stage in his career? The last time I felt this affected by music was when I was at school and first discovering the sounds I loved. This is straight into my top ten of life altering cds.\n", "val": 0.03458782657980919}

For those who believe that this is \"real R&B\", I suggest you listen to all the folks who influenced R. Kelly: Marvin Gaye-who by the way is the REAL KING OF R&B, Lenny Williams, Sam Cooke, and others. I wish I could return this, but unfortunately I can't.\n", "val": 6.122543709352612e-05}

{"text": "Throughout R. Kelly's career, he has flipped-flopped back and forth between being `reserved' and being `cutting-edge.' 2009's underwhelming selling&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Untitled/dp/B002LLDT86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Untitled</a>&nbsp;(a solid, Grammy-nominated R&B album) found Kelly assimilating to new trends and rehashing classic moments. Even when `Untitled' was more `reserved,' it still managed to sport a `parental advisory' label. 2010`s&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Love-Letter/dp/B0048LDTKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Love Letter</a>, on the other hand, finds Kelly on the more `reserved' side. That said, Love Letter is a solid, enjoyable R. Kelly album, sexual, profane references or not.  No one would cite `Love Letter' as Kelly's best necessarily, but it is certainly one of his stronger effort in recent times. Critics who prefer the more overt, `over-the-top' persona will no doubt consider this album `too tame' or even `bland.'After the typical `corny' R. Kelly interlude (\"Love Letter Prelude\") which finds the singer ascending up a scale in thirds at one point, Kelly breaks into the pleasant, enjoyable \"Love Letter,\" which is a direct contrast to the `party-it-up' themed \"Crazy Night\" from `Untitled.'  The chorus is simple, yet memorable: \"Did you get my card/did you read my love letter/ did it touch your heart/when you read my love letter.\"  Subtle it may be, Kelly sounds solid and \"Love Letter\" proves an appropriate, enjoyable opener.  \"Number One Hit\" keeps up the feel-good, low-key vibe. Kelly's vocals sit atop the restrained production well, supported by strings (pads), piano, and synthesizers.  The dramatic turn of the performance at the end is a very nice touch making \"Number One Hit\" feel like a genuine `hit.'\"Not Feeling The Love\" is nearly as enjoyable, featuring the archetypical electric-piano laden production not dissimilar from 1980s R&B.  Kelly barely breaks a sweat on the verse, but heightens the emotion near the end of the cut.  \"Lost In Your Love\"  is solid enough, though it is a cut where you would like for Kelly to `push himself' more as a songwriter.  Even though it is safe and could stand more direction, it is still enjoyable and by no means `filler.' \"Just Can't Get Enough\" is a better cut, clocking in at an incredibly brief 3:10.  The only quibble would be limited songwriting, but much like \"Lost In Your Love,\" it still remains a pleasant cut.\"Taxi Cab\" does a fine job of differentiating itself from anything Kelly has done up to this  point.  While \"Taxi Cab\" does fall into the `hole' of employing some of modern R&B's `bag of gimmicks,' Kelly makes the end result one that is much more positive than negative. Again working with a narrow scope of songwriting, Kelly makes this cut exciting, if for nothing else than comparing the `taxi cab' to the `hotel room.' Now that's our R. Kelly!\"Radio Message\" is one of the album's best and most dynamic cuts, changing the groove from a straightforward four patter to a six feel, channeling classic R&B (think 50's and 60's).  Kelly also allows himself to stretch out vocally.  \"When A Woman Loves\" keeps up this `Kelly transformation,' finding `Kells' achieving some excellent vocal nuances.  The biggest quibble is that \"When A Woman Loves\" is too lengthy, clocking in at over five minutes.\"Love Is\" featuring K. Michelle keeps the momentum high, with the only quibble being the questionable vocal mix (K. Michelle could be mixed a bit closer to the forefront of the mix).  \"Just Like That\" lays well, though \"Music Must Be A Lady\" is most definitely a show stopper!  Why is it when Kelly compares women to the inanimate that he has the most success as a songwriter? The best line - \"Hey sweet soprano, I want you to meet Mr. tenor...\" \"A Love Letter Christmas\" is appropriately place in a timely manner for the holidays, while closer \"How Do I Tell Her\" ends the album as strongly as it began.Essentially, Kelly `knocks it out of the park' on this effort, albeit more conservative than say his Twelve Play albums or his assimilation to hip-hop, 2007's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Double-Up/dp/B000P29B3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Double Up</a>.  Regardless, Kelly has always and will always be a musical chameleon; he always pulls off whatever experiment he tries whether it is songwriting that compares ladies to any and everything or \"Trapped in the Closet\" with it's millions of chapters.  `Love Letter' is a must for any R. Kelly fan.\n", "val": 0.009864229708909988}

But with his first single from Love Letter, he really came out with a big bang. When A Woman Loves is really a great old school soul-driven song. It really is definitely R. Kelly's best as a singer in a long time, since I Believe I Can Fly flew up, up and away for all to hear to heart's delight. I really like the song. It is really a great return to form for him, and I hope that there are more great songs from him to come, as a soulful singer. It really is up there with crooners like Maxwell had shown last year.

{"text": "I never considered myself to be a big R. Kelly fan, although I do own several of his CDs. I can honestly say that the last song that he made that I liked was \"Ignition\", and everything else was straight up crap, with Kelly trying to be a rapper and singing about hanging out in strip clubs and \"doubling up\"...I mean, what the hell was that all about? Some 40-something year old guy going through a mid-life crisis or something?  It was definitely a turn off to me. And Kelly using autotune?? Ugh. He can sing, he didn't need it! I was like, okay, that's it, this guy is done. It was nearly enough to make me forget the excellent material Kelly had turned out in previous years. No question that I gave up on his ability to produce quality music because it seemed that he was trying TOO hard to fit in with the so-called \"artists\" of today and the electronic, computerized junk they have the nerve to call \"music\"! And those allegations...well, I doubt if anyone's going to forget about that.But I've always believed that the music should speak for itself, and on Kelly's last few offerings they weren't saying much, at least not anything that I wanted to hear. But on LOVE LETTER, he comes back for the fan base that he captured at the start of his career, and says, \"I haven't forgotten about yall!\" This is GROWN FOLKS MUSIC, the kind of CD that I've been waiting for YEARS for Kelly to get back to making, and he does it only as he can. I knew he had it in him, and I'm glad he got back to the kind of artistry that we expect from him....good, heartfelt R&B, meaningful and romantic love songs, some with a cool Michael Jackson/Marvin Gaye/Jackie Wilson/Sam Cooke/Otis Redding kind of vibe to them...I could go on in naming artists, but I will just say that just about any significant R&B male artist that has made any real impact in the industry in the past 50 years is pretty much represented here, but channeled through the genius of R. Kelly! LOVE LETTER does have an old school feel to it, so I guess that's why it appeals to me, but yet it's fresh and contemporary. Love the man or hate him, but you cannot deny his talent. This is why he IS King of R&B, for real. Youngun's, take note, because THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE.I don't even have a favorite because all of the songs are on point. Plus there is a hidden track - Kelly's version of the hit song he wrote for MJ: \"You Are Not Alone\". It's a beautiful tribute to his \"hero\" and friend as he says in the intro of the song. For those of you who enjoyed the earlier works of Kelly, this is a CD you should definitely own. Get it, you won't be sorry! Happy New Year!P.S. - I have to add that the music for \"Music Must Be A Lady\" sounds like an EXACT duplicate of the Marvin Gaye song \"Just To Keep You Satisfied\" (1973) from the LET'S GET IT ON album. I'm surprised that no one else noticed this, but I'm guessing that the majority of reviewers here aren't as familiar with Marvin's music as they claim to be. Let's hope Kelly worked his way around the legalities of using this tune to base his song on.\n", "val": 0.0005259018507786095}

If anything Trey bit off quite a bit of what R. Kelly the artist has accomplished.  Singles like \"your body is calling\", \"Bump & Grind\", \"When A Woman Is Fed Up\" and many others not even to mention \"I Believe I can Fly\" Songz has yet to come close to.This album is musical masterpiece that has shown how R. Kelly has come full circle as a artist.  He lost a lot of his loyal fans during his time of trying a little too hard to appeal to the younger audience by making records that lacked substance.  From the beginning of the album to the very end there there is no record on the album that would fit under the \"filler\" category.This album ranks amongst my favorites that Kelly has released.

{"text": "With all the controversy that sorrounds him, plus a roller coaster personal life, I wonder, how on planet earth does he continue to produce these kind of records for himself and others?. I think the blessings of GOD himself is upon him!!!.I own all of R.KELLY'S albums and this one is one of, if not, the very best of them all!!. From the instrumentless \"LOVE LETTER PRELUDE\" to \"YOU ARE NOT ALONE\" a tribute to MICHAEL JACKSON, the album is perfect from start to finish!!.Stanout songs are: \"LOVE LETTER\", \"NUMBER ONE HIT\",\"LOST IN YOUR LOVE\",\"I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH\", oh I realy love this one, it have a MARVIN GAYE effect!.\"TAXI CAB\" didn't fare too well with me, \"RADIO MESSAGE\" is so pleading in it's essence, great work!. \"WHEN A WOMAN LOVES\" is in a school by itself!! it gives a PERCY SLEDGE effect, wow!! KELLS was singing his heart out here!!. I love this song with my entire bieng!!. \"LOVE IS\" with K MICHELLE is so heartwarming so classy, I love it too. \"JUST LIKE THAT\", \"MUSIC MUST BE A LADY\" are both supreme efforts, each song is absolute!. Oh my let's not forget \"A LOVE LETTER CHRISTMAS\" and \"the painful \"HOW DO I TELL HER?\" again, absolution abounds!!.After ten years, some artists vanishes or simply burn out, but for R.KELLY,after twenty years,like fine wine, he keeps getting stronger!!. I highly recomend this modern classic to all who want to feel great music!.It will take you way back,then brings you to the front!!!.\n", "val": 0.02404167875647545}

{"text": "I'm sure we can debate for some time the number of albums Kells has dropped that can be considered classics...(12 Play, R., TP-2. Com, The Chocolate Factory), but with the ever changing styles that have emerged in R&B music today, he has managed to stay relevant, even with a couple of sub-par albums in a precedent that he previously set. Love Letter is a CERTIFIED CLASSIC! There is no argument there. This is the type of album your 7 year-old will groove to, a college student, a 30-something hipster, your mother and even your grandfather. It is an album that you want to listen to over and over again. I always say that music should have the power to envoke a feeling, an emotion that makes you feel connected to it. Love Letter accomplishes that. There are songs on this album that will make you wave your hands, sway, slow dance, and think. R. Kelly has yet again proven that he gets it. God has given him talents that he has used to the fullest on this record and created music that will no doubt - last a lifetime!\n", "val": 0.041193585842847824}

{"text": "This is my first ever review and it's fitting it would be for Robert (I've called him that since the scandal just because LoL). I'm an R&B fanatic, always have been, always will be. I'm 25 and I've heard a little bit of everything from the best to ever do it from every decade 60's and up. R. Kelly in my opinion has been and continues to be the best male R&B singer period at least of my generation. I was right there with from \"Your Body's Callin\" and me reminding him of his Jeep LoL up until \"Feelin on Yo Booty\" and him sticking his key in the \"Ignition\" and it was all hot. Yes, Trapped in the Closet was the most ridiculously EXTRA series ever,and I've never wanted someone to open a closet so much in my life LoL but every artist does too much at some point. While I love the bump and grind Robert I feel like \"Love Letter\" exposes the mature, grown-man love and romance that artists like Teddy P. and Marvin Gaye exuded but still sounds current. People wanna say he fell off, but he never left. This man is 2 decades deep in this industry and he is still completely in his own lane and well above a lot of the mediocrity out there today including wannabe's like Trey Songz who will definitely be forgotten in the near future. R&B has pissed me off lately with so many artists going pop and becoming generic, almost lazy (love Chris Brown Though). That's why I haven't bought an album since 2005, until today. That's why I always come back to R. Kelly. He can't take you to church or put you to bed. He can do it all and that is why he remains so consistently relevant. Chocolate Factory, R. Kelly, 12 Play, TP-2.com still get rotation, and this one will get worn out too. Don't forget we're not just talking about an amazing singer--he's also a producer/songwriter/arranger of every piece of work he's ever created. Who's doing that now? This man is a legend, often imitated, NEVER duplicated. My faves are: Love Letter, Number One Hit, Not Feelin' The Love, Lost In Your Love, and Radio Message but the whole album is beautiful. Please support TRUE, REAL R&B and buy this. Take it from someone who hasn't purchased a CD in 5 years. It gets no better. Who's hotter than him--seriously.

I have to say that this project has to be one of the best projects that he has created since the Happy People project.  I understand that as we get older the music industry is evolving everyday, but I have to say that R. Kelly doesn't have to be a statistic of the industry.  Unlike other so called artist today, R. Kelly allows his total and complete talents that the almighty God blessed him with and allows us to be re-invited to real R & B music once again.  I am avery big R. Kelly fan, but I have to say there has been some projects of lately that I really wasn't feeling and only knowing that he wasn't using his full potentials on some past projects just trying to cater to the kids today, when all along when he sticks to what works for him, such as this project \"Love Letters\" you can clearly hear the difference.  I highly recommend this project to each and everyone that loves great R & B.  Highlights on this project: Love Letters, Number One Hit, Not Feelin' The Love, Just Can't Get Enough, When A Woman Loves and A Love Letter Christmas.  R.

Few will deny that he is the father-in-style to several popular male vocalists over the past decade.

Kelly captured on his Happy People disc. The only difference here is many of the songs are slower pace. As for the three or four 50's-feeling songs, R. Kelly simply mastered the genre as only he can.

{"text": "There are so many reasons why I call R. Kelly the undisputed King Of R&B. One of them being the fact that the man's talent is unmatched in this ever changing music industry. Weather we are talking about his exceptional vocals, or his amazing swagger, or his ability to make every track he's a part of his own track. Another reason I call him the King of R&B, is because he is a true musician in every sense of the word. He writes, produces, sings, and plays instruments on all of his own records. He rarely lets other people produce or write for him, with the exception of his last album Untitled, and his '98 record R. And not only does he produce/write the majority of his own music, he also does so for other artists ranging from the legendary Michael Jackson to the lesser know R&B singer Joe. And another thing that has to be acknowledged about R.Kellys resume, is that he has been able to maintain relevance for almost 20 years, and not only maintain that relevance, but also dominate the R&B genre for almost that entire time. He helped change R&B into what it is today. Without R. Kelly, there wouldn't be any Usher's, or Chris Brown's, or Trey Songz's. R. Kelly paved the way for all of those artists, and not only that but he's also sold 40 million records and had a over 20 hit singles along the way. Needless to say, R. Kelly is easily the best modern day R&B singer of our time. He's like the new Marvin Gaye, which R. Kelly considers Marvin to be one of his biggest influences, and some would argue that Kells is better. He's won Grammy's, Soul Train Awards, Lifetime Achievement Awards, graced covers of several magazines, produced his own mini movie... I mean honestly, what has the guy not done in his 20 year stint in this entertainment business?One of the things that I admire most about R. Kelly, is his diversity. He is such a unique artist that has so many different sides to his musical genius that it almost make it hard to tell what kind of artist he truly is. I mean obviously he is a bonafide R&B singer, and there is no doubt about that. But the thing I love about R. Kelly, and this is probably one of the biggest reason's why he's been able to stay relevant all these years, is that he is always changing. And I don't know if \"Changing\" is really the right word im looking for, but he is always tweeking and adding different styles to his craft. Like I said there are so  many sides to R. Kelly's artistry, there's the partying \"Ignition\" and \"Fiesta\" R. Kelly, there's the club goer \"I'm A Flirt\" and \"Supaman High\" R. Kelly, there's the sentimental \"I Wish\" and \"I'm Your Angel\" R. Kelly, there's the inspirational \"I Believe I Can Fly\" and \"World's Greatest\" R. Kelly, there's the Thug \"Double Up\" and \"Playa's Only\" R. Kelly, and my personal favorite baby making time \"Echo\" and \"Bump and Grind\" R. Kelly... And of course there's the strait up, what I like to call the Loverman side of R. Kelly, which was mostly shown on his Chocolate Factory album, and now Love Letter as well... Like I said, the man is very versatile...Which is why he is probably my favorite artist of all time. It's because every one of his albums is different from the last or has a completely different theme than the last. R. was his radio ready breakthrough record, TP-2.com was his strait up baby maker, Chocolate Factory was a love album, Happy People/U Saved Me was stepper's music/gospel, Double Up was a hip hop record, and Untitled was a collage of contemporary R&B. Now I'm not saying that those album's are strictly in those themes, obviously it can vary a little bit, but generally speaking his albums do tend to have a specific theme for the most part.Now if I had to compare Love Letter to any of his previous albums, it would be without a doubt in my mind compared to the love album Chocolate Factory. As a matter of fact, after the first listen to Love Letter, I was calling it the poor man's Chocolate Factory, because sonically and lyrically, both of the album's have the same warm, lovey, romantic vibe. With Love Letter he does have a strong throwback 60's/70's soul vibe, which was only sprinkled on Chocolate Factory, where as with Love Letter the throwback vibe does tend to dominate a little more, which is why the album is garnering strong reviews most likely. The problem with Love Letter, and what's keeping it from being a classic like Untitled, is that although it is nice and refreshing to hear that 70's  throwback style today among all the pop/r&b thats dominating the charts today, Love Letter does drag a little bit and at times kind of starts to sound bland and a bit out dated. I'm not saying its a bad album or even sub par, but it's not one of his best albums. I understand what he was trying to accomplish with this album, but there's just not many songs at all on the album that have that aggressive, carnal tones that have made R the legend he is today. R. Kelly has always been known for his raunchy overly sexual baby makers, which is where he most successful and most dominant. And for me personally, the baby makers are my personal favorites from R. Kelly, because he does them the best...But there is little to none of that on Love Letter. Much like Chocolate Factory, on Love Letter the song's that do have any sort sexuality, which isn't much at all, but when there is that little bit of sexuality it's more in the form of romance than the typical raunchy style R. Kelly brings most of the time. Like on loud and roaring \"Taxi Cab\" or the mellow slow jam \"Lost In Your Love\", which are both standouts. But where R. Kelly really dominates on this album is the throwback soul slow jams, like on the smooth title track, and the old school \"When A Woman Love\", and on the groovy slow jam \"Number One Hit\", he compares his the love of his woman to that joy of a number one hit. \"Number One Hit\" sounds sooooo much like a track from Chocolate Factory that I almost wondered if it might have been from the Chocolate Factory sessions, the way he just smoothly glides across the mellow instrumental. It's for sure one of the standout cuts from the album, along with the catchy desperate I Want You Back anthem \"Radio Message\". And Mr. Kelly also does a pretty great cover of MJ's \"You Are Not Alone\", which isn't surprising since he wrote and produced the track for MJ. Overall, it's not a surprise that this album is getting the great reviews it is, and it will likely be looked at as a comeback record for R. Kelly even though he has never really left, as his last album Untitled was also great, but it was also a completely different style. The thing that will win a lot of people over with this record is it's soulfulness, and its throwback 70's soul vibe, which is rare these days from contemporary R&B singers...It's not his best record, and I definitely do prefer Untitled over this one, but it is still a strong album...But if anyone can pull off this type of style change, it would be the extremely versatile Mr R. Kelly!Grade:C+\n", "val": 0.021985501050949097}
{"text": "This CD is ridiculously excellent.  There is not one throwaway track on the album. No, not one. It is all good from beginning to end.  R. Kelly sounds as if he was heavily influenced by Michael Jackson's voice and Michael's style of singing as well as Michael's musical composition throughout the album.  I hope it was to pay homage to him and, if so, I hope and pray that R. Kelly says it publicly so that there can be no ambiquity. I don't know if it was happenstance that both of their respective CD's were released on the same day but you cannot mistake the connection between the two CD's.  There will never be another Michael Jackson and if R. Kelly keeps this level of RESPECT to music high and in front of him always, then one will say...there will never be another R. Kelly.\n", "val": 0.023131823167204857}

From then on in, you are caught, hook, line and sinker.The vocals, instrumentation, and production are simply the very best from the undisputed 'King of RnB'. Oh, and let's not get this twisted people R. Kelly has no competition, other than himself.On 'Love Letter' Rob has challenged himself to create an album that is:a) Real RnBb) Pays homage to the Greats who have went before himc) Fund) Somehow feels fresh and fits in with life in 2010An impossible task for most, but not a musical genius and true living legend.From the late great Michael Jackson, to Ottis Redding, to Sam Cooke, to Marvin Gaye, to Jackie Wilson, to the aforementioned Stevie Wonder, and more - they are all here saying hi, but channelled through the brilliance of R. Kelly.Many might think that Rob has been quiet over the last 10 years, but when you have 4 classic albums in a decade (TP2. Com, Chocolate Factory, Happy People/U Saved Me, and now Love Letter) that is no mean feat. Some people cant even release 4 albums in their career let alone in that period of time, and for them to touch 'classic' status is merely a dream.We don't even have to get into what dude did in the 90's, because we'd be here all day.People like to pigeon hole R. Kelly but he encompasses all genres of music, and really has no limits. Critics in the media often want to make fun of him, but when it comes to this music - R. Kelly is as serious as they come!'Love Letter' is a testimony to his 20 years in the game, and a gift for all people. Music is a beautiful thing when done right, and R. Kelly really did right with this LP.Don't sleep, don't talk, don't hesitate...Pick this up, and let this 'Love Letter' transport you to Musical Heaven - 'Real Talk'.\n", "val": 0.02457253448665142}

{"text": "If Dick Clark is the world's oldest teenager, then Redman is the world's oldest ten year old. In his 20 year history, he has amassed a long and respectable career as a rapper- sophmoric humor aside. His first three albums are widely considered classic albums- starting with his 1992 debut \"Whut? Thee Album\", the rather dark sophomore effort \"Dare Iz A Darkside\", and 1996's \"Muddy Waters\". He experienced his biggest success with 1998's \"Doc's Da Name 2000\", an album that garnered him his biggest radio hit as well as a platinum album to boot. Over the years, he has released other solo albums, dabbled in films and done a couple of collaborative albums- notably with Method Man as well as his Def Squad project with Keith Murray and mentor/producer Erick Sermon. While those albums were critically acclaimed and well received, it seemed that Redman was playing it safe, not branching out from his comfort zone- that is until now, when he released his new album \"Reggie\".For those expecting a typical Redman album, there are two things that need to be addressed. One: It's a very left of center effort without any songs produced by Erick Sermon. Two: The songs that preceded the release \"Lookin' Fly\" and \"Coc Back\" are not on the album. Save for the DJ Khalil produced first single \"Def Jammable\" and the Rockwilder produced role playing \"Mic, Lights, Camera, Action\", most of the production on the album is handled by virtual unknowns. While \"Reggie\" is billed as a \"pop record\", it's more along the lines of a mature record- look no further than the songs \"Lemme Get 2\" in which Redman extols in the virtues of travelling and seeing the world and the Faith Evans featured \"All I Do\", which he dedicates to his fans. While this album is devoid of any Erick Sermon production, the closing track \"Tiger Crane Style\" sounds very much like something he would have done. Lastly, no Redman album would be complete without the signature weed song. In this case, it's \"Lite 1 Witcha Boi\" featuring Method Man and Bun B- reprising his appearance with them after appearing on their 2009 album \"Blackout 2\". A couple of the songs on \"Reggie\" could have been left off- such as \"Lift It Up\" and the bland \"Whn The Lights Go Off\". \"Reggie\" is a project worth checking out, but it's not for everyone. It's going to take a few spins to truly get into this album- as it is completely different from anything Redman has ever done.\n", "val": 0.00016468542162328959}
{"text": "Overall, I give \"Reggie\" four stars because Red has evolved. Stop trying to listen for the Redman of the 90's...He's staying relevant and in doing so, remains totally overlooked and underrated...Like another reviewer said, you could put this album on and just go about your business...it's an easy listen...for me, it's putting it on my ipod and running a couple laps...the beats are there...Anyway, I am no rap or hip-hop officianato...I just always liked Redman's music, his beats, so here goes:1) Reggie (Intro): A pretty good intro song, nothing fancy...just something to start the blood flowing. 4/52) That's Where I Be: A nice beat as Red goes geographic...DJ Kool adds a nice touch...I like that high-pitch sound. 4/53) Def Jammable: OK, a statement about the record label, but done tastefully...I like the drum break. 4/54) Full Nelson: Man, I know many will disagree with me on this one. My favorite track on \"Red Gone Wild\" is \"Sumthin' for Urrbody.\"  Part of my bias is the collaborative effect. \"Full Nelson\" uses Ready Roc, Runt Dawg and Saukrates for the same goal. Nice hook. 5/55) Lift It Up: I just don't feel it. There's just nothing special. I like hooks and catchy breaks. 2/56) All I Do: If the album needs a change of pace, this is the time. I'm no R&B fan, but it is melodic. 3/57) Lemme Get 2: I love the (hesitation?) beats, and Saukrates kills it as his bass vocals collaborate well with Red's usual flow. 5/58) Mic, Lights, Camera, Action: Really poor lyrics. I wish Red wouldn't get political. 1/59) Cheerz: As you might have guessed, too slow for me...But Ready Roc blends in well with Red here and Melanie is spot on. 4/510) Rockin' Wit Da Best: \"Rock the house, yo!\" Now, we're talkin'...The drum beat gets my head bobbin' and Kool Moe Dee adds a touch to boot 5/511) Lite 1 Witcha Boi: Full disclosure, I don't smoke...so I can't relate...Typically good Red and Meth collaborative lyrics, but too slow for me 2/512) When The Lights Go Off: Where have I heard this sound before? Not bad for a slow song. Sounds a little \"forced.\" 3/513) Tiger Style Crane: What's not to like? Great beat, Red sound raw. To me, it sounds like a mixtape track, which is good considering Red puts out awesome mixtapes. Definitely gets the blood flowing. 5/5\n", "val": 0.0007418261375278234}
{"text": "OK, I've owned every one of Redman's albums. He's one of the few artists I still try to buy on or near the release date. Of course, it's tough with his albums - the date always gets pushed back months, years it seems!Relative to all the junk out there, it's not a horrible album, but I might be gracious giving this 3 stars, given what we are used to from Redman. Sadly, you see some sparks of brilliance lyrically at some points, but it just seems like he pieced together an album of a couple of great, but otherwise mediocre tracks. It's sad because Redman, in my opinion, is lyrically one of the best (and funniest) lyricists in the game and generally consistent. You just wonder what he could do, if he put more effort into it. Even the album artwork is last-minute.And, I'm pretty sure there's not a Supaman Lova track, like he usually features. That's usually one of my favorite trademarks, and he clearly had room on the album.\n", "val": 0.0008105052984319627}

This album is like a collection of throw away tracks that never made any albums or mixtapes.  Only two songs are good and the rest are just horrible. What is with the slow R&B tracks and the auto tune?  Most of the guest emcees aren't worthy and add nothing to the failure called an album.  I just can't see Redman giving the okay to drop this cd.  Something tells me this was an album owed to the record label and wanted out of his contract.  Not sure, the artist must still realize that his reputation and name is still on it.  Again, I am huge Redman fan and I really hated to do this to my boy.  But, if he is going to have the audacity to release this album, then why can't I tell him and others the truth?

This cheesy T-Pain auto-tune style is just not fitting for Red.Second, he needs to ditch the dudes from Gilla House.  They add nothing to the tracks.  They drag it down.Redman is not someone who needs to have other people rapping on his tracks.  But if you insist on doing it, at least bring back Keith murray.  These other dudes are just wack.I listened to this album on the way to work today and i skipped through several tracks, not even able to make it to the end of the track.I would say there are maybe 2 solid tracks on this album that I would listen to again.

{"text": "If you are a hardcore Red fan, pick this up,  there are good tracks on here.If you are a more casual fan thats hoping for another Muddy Waters, or something that sounds like any of his other classics, then skip this one.Redman is my favorite rapper of all time, hands down.  For nearly two decades hes been dropping classic after classic.  Whut was one of the first tapes I ever had and I been following his career ever since, and have not been let down once.  Who knows what the story is behind this album, but its out, and I'm glad to have another Red cd to add to my collection.  So what if after almost 20 years he wants to try something different?  Red's signature rhyming and gutter flow are still present on every track.  Whats mostly different about this album are the beats and hooks - and none of his classic funny skits.  Theres tracks on here I really like, and then some I cant get with.Intro - Great way to start it off.  Red doing what he does best - tearing it up over a good beat.  Leaves you wanting more.Thats Where I be - Its a club kinda beat, I been skipping over this one.Def Jammable - I dig this one.  Nice beat with good Bass.  His flow is a little different here, along with the chorus,  but it sounds good.Full Nelson - No thanks.Lift it up -  A Dirty South track,  I say leave that to the Southren rappers.  Not diggin it.All I do - Sounds like a R&B kinda song.  Not bad,  take it or leave it.Lemme Get 2 - The thought of Red doing a softer track makes me cringe,  but this isn't bad, I kinda dig it.  Red rapping about life and such.Mic, Lights, Camera, Action - No thanks.Cheerz - This has become my favorite track on the album.  Nice beat with soul and bass,  Ready Roc and Red trading verses and both nail it.  Melanie Rutherford on the hook and her voice is fantastic!Rockin with the best - Nice up tempo song,  Red kills it, and Kool Moe Dee with some light vocals in the background.Light 1 witcha boi -  Mef, Red, and Bun B come through with good rhymes but this beat is too light and soft for my tastes,  this would be a good track to remix over a harder beat.When the lights go off - Not feelin it.Tiger Style Crane - Now this is the Red we all know and love.  Closes out the album with a good banger, the flow and drums kinda remind me of Gilla House Check off Red Gone Wild.My advice is if you are a Red fan then pick this up and just bump the tracks you like.  After reading some of the other reviews I see people disagree about whats good and bad with this album.  Some hated Def Jammble, I love that track.  Another person likes Thats Where I be,  while I'm not feelin it. Take a chance and decide for yourself.  Its starting to grow on me more and more.  And Redman, we still love you, thank you for blessing us with another one.  Looking forward to Muddy Waters 2!\n", "val": 0.013325203210115433}

{"text": "I don't know, but to my ears this is a very 'by the numbers' disc, and while fun, barely anything distinguishable. Very surprised by the strong response for the limited number of reviews for this.The tracks are driving, riff driven,with some good rocking moments. That wraps up 90% of them. The attempts at catchy choruses takes away from a track or two and the rather basic style of the whole thing leaves something to be desired. Its a safe rock and roll record that's fun but unmemorable for the most part. I do like the sound but there are no real stand out numbers.I have listened at least twice and my feet tap a few times but then, I don't remember most of it. I wanted to like it, as I am a seasoned metal head in the 40 something range and like some of the bands the members come from (Anthrax, Every time..). Maybe they just wanted something to tour with in between main projects and if that's the real intent, then it serves its purpose. It will sound great loud in a club. As I said, It does have its moments. I won't toss it away or anything and will listen to some tracks repeatedly i'm sure.I would say its in the same vein as Hell Yeah. Not in sound so much as intent.

{"text": "The Damned Things are a super group consisting of singer Keith Buckley and Josh Newton from Every Time I Die, Joe Trohman and Andy Hurley from Fall Out Boy, and Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano from Anthrax.  A first word of caution: those expecting the melodic hardcore of Every Time I Die, Trash Metal from Anthrax, or pop-punk from Fall Out Boy will be disappointed.  In order to enjoy this album, you have to go in without preconceptions of these bands, which can often be challenging.  What you do get, however, is an nice combination of all three bands blended into an excellent rock album.This album is simply catchy, straight-up rock music with some clever lyrical wordplay us Keith Buckley fans enjoy.  The vocals are very much Keith Buckley, but it's predominantly clean, slightly restrained singing, mostly without the signature screams you'd be accustomed to as an Every Time I Die fan.  The guitar riffs are more memorable than most pop-based rock bands, also heavier in some parts, and the rhythm section matches up nicely.  The album doesn't dive into the seemingly mandatory ballad at any point, so it maintains a consistent, up-beat tempo.Anyone into addictive rock music listens from front to back should add this album to their collection.  It's one of my favorite 2010 releases, and I was honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.\n", "val": 0.02157796360552311}

You may have heard the riffs before, but not sung to these types of great melodies and some superb drum thumping.  Think Led Zepplin or Thin Lizzy, but a tad heavier.  If you are like me, the songs don't really sink in until the 2nd or 3rd listen and then you are hooked.

{"text": "Being a huge fan of Every Time I Die, I had to check this out. Keith Buckley and Josh Newton working on a sideproject? Oh Yes! However, I was given a quite different result. Me thinking, \"ok, just more ETID.\" But to no surprise, members of Fall Out Boy and the iconic Anthrax were also involved. With so many kinds of influences i was nervous to think about what kind of outcome The Damned Things would be. But to my liking, the result was nothing short of \"energetic.\"I am pleased that Keith takes a different approach to TDT with his vocals. He fluctuates his range on certian times for emphasis, the rest is quite strong. To the fans of Every Time I Die, when Keith reverts back to his \"strengths\" man does it shine. The ending of \"graverobber\" is a primary example of his forte, and it certainly feels welcome. Now, the instrumentals are a definetaly a treat. The overall sound of the album is energetic and very \"rock oriented.\" I actually grew to like this division. The drums (andy hurley) are some of the most diverse material on the album. Scott and Rob of Anthrax do their part on cranking the speed and adrenaline of the tracks. All together, the overall sound and perscussion of Ironiclast is something everyone can enjoy. Some songs surely play off their strengths and are sure examples of \"experimental.\"The Damned Things Ironiclast boasts ten songs of speed, rhythm and natural song-writing. I extremely appreciate their effort on bridging a gap between the atmospheres of blues, hard rock, and groove. It is a fun album to listen to with its blissful transitions between tracks. Keith's more prominent clean vocals are surely one of the elements i did not see coming, but now, feel natural to me.STAND OUT TRACKS*BAD BLOOD*FRIDAY NIGHT*LITTLE DARLING*IRONICLAST*BLUES HAVIN' BLUES\n", "val": 0.035976625978946686}

I cannot recommend this music when there is so much better music out there. There are too many 'throw away' songs on this album; simply boring songs.  Nicki Bluhm does not have a real strong voice and, for my tastes, she cannot produce a strong CD on her own, as evidenced by songs on this CD when she does it more on her own voice.  Suggestion: Check out Mia Dyson if you want a CD by an emerging artist, especially her, \"When The Moment Comes\".  Your mileage may vary.Edit: After seeing Nicki Bluhm in concert, I gave this CD a third star.  The show was good, but not great.Re-edit: After hearing this more on my stereo, I've again gone back to 2-stars, as I am rating the CD, not her live show.  Some of the songs simply lack any creativity and are typical of what you'd see from a bar band, trying hard to be a rock and roll stars, yet falling far short of the mark.  Some of the guitar work is amongst the most uninspired music I've heard on any of the over 1800 records and CD's I own.

It makes the most beautiful music of the very highest standard available to the masses, without the slightest hint of being dumbed-down. Saint Saens' reputation has suffered because of that attitude, and it is only now, at the dawn of the 21st century as classical music has been threatened by total marginalization, that the arbiters have finally given him his due and as the leading French composer of the romantic era. This collection makes that clear.I can see parallels with other composers. Just as Saint Saens has been criticized for not sounding French enough, Samuel Barber has finally overcome the rap of not sounding American enough, while Shostakovich, ironically long criticized for being too Russian, finally seems to be supplanting erstwhile Russian Stravinsky as the greatest 20th century composer of any nationality. Looks like old Saint Saens finally got the last laugh for walking out of \"Rite of Spring\" in trendy fin de siecle Paris, eh T. Fisher?\n", "val": 0.008740073069930077}
{"text": "It is a real pleasure to see the X5 \"99\" series coming to composers, like Edvard Grieg earlier and now Camille Saint-Sans, that are not on the forefront of popularity -- not the Beethovens, Bachs and Mozarts of the classical world. This is a great set and represents a remarkable bargain. Particularly with composers who are off the beaten path, there is a much better chance of really expanding one's collection and musical horizons with a set like this.Until now, for example, I basically owned only a copy of Saint-Sans numbered symphonies and the famous \"Carnival of the Animals\", plus a few stray tracks that were featured on earlier X5 sets. This collection adds fine performances of the \"Urbs Roma\" symphony, the Symphony in A major, three violin concertos, two cello concertos, two piano concertos, an orchestral suite, a handful of solo organ works, and a number of shorter works.Saint-Sans was a diverse intellectual and by all accounts the finest organist of his day, who played at churches throughout his career, culminating with a permanent job as organist at the huge neo-classical Madeleine chuch in Paris. He was was a real revolutionary early on, championing new music in a conservative French classical world -- new music at the time being especially by composers like Liszt and Wagner.But by the end of his career, he became an arch-conservative, almost reactionary. He railed against Cesar Franck, Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss, for example. He is also famously said to have walked out of the first performance of Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" in a huff over the \"misuse\" of the bassoon -- although Stravinsky himself insisted this was fiction and that Saint-Sans was not even in attendance. He also suppressed the publication of \"The Carnival of the Animals\", now his most popular work, until after his death, reportedly because he was afraid it would hurt his reputation as a \"serious\" composer.He shouldn't have worried too much, because he left behind a lot of great music. I'm happy to get to know a lot more of it here. The set includes most of the main works he is remembered for now, including Symphony No. 3 (the Organ Symphony), Introduction and Rondo Capriccio, Violin Concerto No. 3 and even selections from the opera \"Samson and Delilah\". One could complain it is missing some of the later piano concertos, but overall, the selection of works is really outstanding.The set is wonderful, but it isn't perfect. My main gripe is that the Carnival of the Animals is not an integral performance -- \"The Swan\", the most famous bit, is by the Stockholm Chamber Duo rather than the St Petersburg Radio Symphony, which performs the rest of it. This is a gratuitous change -- not to mention that the version of \"The Swan\" offered here has already appeared on four different previous \"99\" sets. In addition, tracks 65 and 66 are reversed -- or should be. I changed them in my library so that track 65 continues on into tracks 67 and 68 -- the rest of Piano Concerto No. 2.Buyers of previous sets will find only minimal duplication here. The following tracks have appeared on earlier \"99\" sets:- 2. Introduction and Rondo Capriccio (99 Most Essential Violin)- 9. Carnival of the Animals: VII Aquarium (99 Darkest)- 15. Carnival of the Animals: XIII The Swan (four different sets)- 17. Danse Macabre (99 Darkest)- 23. Havanaise in E major for Violin and Orchestra (99 Most Essential Violin)Also, the third movement of Piano Concerto No 2 was featured on the \"Allegros\" set, but in a different performance.The technical quality is very good, with nicely engineered recordings. Bitrates all variable, averaging in the 184-270 range. The 9.7 hour set has a total download size of 958 MB.As a previous reviewer said, many of these recordings were first put out on the Bis label.

{"text": "Being a new Brandon Heath fan... (Almost a year now), I was really excited to get his new album Leaving Eden.  Being an artist myself, I thoroughly enjoy Brandon's style of writing and painting a picture with his songs.  The haunting sound of the first song and title track \"Leaving Eden\" hits home Brandon's whole message for this project.  The world is sometimes a mess and we are sometimes caught up in it, but God in his infinite mercy and grace will always see us through.  No doubt that \"Your Love\" was his first release and the right pick.  It's been an amazing hit for radio and reminiscent of \"Give Me Your Eyes\" from his What if We album (he wrote this song with the same guy who he wrote Give Me Your Eyes). However, I think one of the best songs on the whole project is \"Stolen\".  This song is so powerful with the driving rhythm and the overwhelming message that Jesus has stolen our hearts and saved us.  What a wonderful place to be!!!!  The song \"It's No Good to Be Alone\" is a great song to put on while you're running around the house doing chores etc...It will get stuck in your head and you will be singing it for days....great song.

{"text": "I've been a big fan of Brandon Heath ever since first seeing him in concert with Third Day on their Revelations Tour.  Brandon Heath rocked it that night, featuring songs mostly from his second album, \"What If We\".  That, and his first album, \"Don't Get Comfortable\", were amazingly good efforts.  His third album, \"Leaving Eden\", is also quite excellent, but it has not yet grown on me as much as the first two.  Here are my thoughts on some of the better songs on the album:The album title track, \"Leaving Eden\", features a percussion heavy beat and some interesting lyrics.  The basis of the track is the sin in this world and the many problems we are faced with every day - all of which makes us feel like we are indeed leaving Eden, or in my interpretation, the presence of God.  Home, with God, is what we long for in this state.  Indeed the song ends with, \"I'm going home\", which is where we long to be.  This is a message of hope for a lost world.The best song on the album as far as I am concerned is, \"Your Love\".  This song has a classic Brandon Heath sound and feel - the heavy base in the background, the smooth and yet somehow slightly raspy at the same time vocals, and a great message.  When is seems like you've lost your dreams, and your innocence has been taken - take heed!  Not everything has been lost.  God's love is enough to light up the darkness.  This is another message of hope - which is indeed the message replete throughout the album.While the remainder of the album is quite good, it didn't quite measure up to me compared with his first two albums.  That said; if you are a fan of Brandon Heath, you'll really enjoy this album.  I think it is a slightly different twist on the style we saw in the first two albums; expanding his capability as an artist.  Most importantly, this album glorifies God as strong as his first two albums - so with that, any quibbles I have are minor at best.\n", "val": 0.01177690178155899}

{"text": "If I'm truly honest, which I resolved to be in 2011, I have mixed reactions to Brandon Heath's third studio album, Leaving Eden.  It could be that my standards are too high, but I thought Heath's third album was just good.  I wanted it to be great.Lyrically, the album is weak.  I mean, it's good enough for other artists, but Brandon Heath is an excellent lyricist, most evidenced in his first album.  Steadily, Heath's lyrics have fallen in line more with pop music standards as opposed to the depth offered by singer/songwriters.Don't get me wrong.  There are beautiful songs on this album, such as my favorite, \"It's Alright,\" which uses details from Jesus' life to remind listeners of Jesus' promise never to leave believers.  The title track, \"Leaving Eden\"proves that Heath can bring game to a third album.  Other songs like \"Only Water\" and \"The Light In Me\" rally Leaving Eden forward, and seem more true to the type of artist Brandon Heath seems to be.I wish the album had more flow, more transition, more...something.  To me the songs and message is repetitive--not in a way that creates a full picture of all that Heath is capable.  Rather, I find myself becoming bored with the constant percussion and lack of movement within the songs.  I believe Leaving Eden is supposed to have a progressive sound to show Brandon Heath's growth as an artist.  I just don't feel the sound works for Heath dulling his voice and overshadowing his vocals with too much extra noise.Would I buy this album?  Probably...because I adore Brandon Heath.

{"text": "Brandon Heath has always been adept at creating catchy, talented melodies while retaining a mellow Christian flair with his music. His latest release, \"Leaving Eden\", is no exception. Through eleven upbeat tracks, Brandon once again delivers an impressive contemporary Christian experience, though the end result may not be quite so memorable as his previous release, \"What If We\".The title track opens up the record--an anthem-style effort that, while occasionally indulging in cheesy songwriting (\"Old lady next door / Forgot her own name), remains solid in the end. Radio hit \"Your Love\" exposes listeners to Brandon's love of the Lord and passion for simple, honest songwriting.With this release, Brandon has for the most part opted out of the acoustic ballads which graced his previous records, in favor of a more contemporary, pop-influenced style filled with heavy drum-and-clap beats. You'll even hear a little autotune here and there, but rest assured that the artist's new approach hasn't gone to his head. Though most of the tracks, including a heartfelt tune entitled \"The Light in Me\", are upbeat and modern in their composition, others such as \"Only Water\" bring back memories of Brandon's past ballads.\"It's Alright\" actually made me cry, and there aren't too many songs out there that can do that to me. It's one of Brandon's more beautiful and emotional efforts, filled with a heartfelt message based on Christ's calming of the storm on the sea. From there we're led into \"It's No Good to Be Alone\", a fun track with an open and  inviting theme. The album closes with \"As Long As I'm Here\", a quieter sort of track that asks how well we will have loved at the end of our lives, when we pass from mortality into eternity.Overall, Brandon Heath has crafted yet another solid Christian release with \"Leaving Eden\". It'll please those who love modern pop and heavy percussion beats, while still satisfying devoted fans of the artist. It's not flawless, and it doesn't altogether reach the level that \"What If We\" did, but those who decide to pick this one up should find themselves uplifted and satisfied by the close of the final track.\n", "val": 0.013467960059642792}

{"text": "I've been an avid Will Ackerman fan for the past 3 years, but I only had a small selection of songs to listen to, including Visiting, Anne's Song, and The Bricklayer's Beautiful Daughter. Desiring more songs by Ackerman, I bought this album, and it was much better than I was expecting. Songs of special note:Anne's Song - possibly Will's most iconic piece, this recording seems to have a softer tuning, and you can really tell that Will put more effort, consideration, and patience in this production of Anne's Song compared to previous recordings of it.Hawk Circle - it was great to finally hear this song in a studio recorded version as opposed to live, as the live performance seemed incomplete and the recording quality was lacking. This is a song to listen to if you want to just be baffled by the skill poured into the piece.The Virgin Spirit, apart from the simplification of the name (it used to be \"The Impending Death of the Virgin Spirit\"), is still as good as ever and still conveys the emotional nature of the song.Zuzu's Petals does well for a late evening walk type of song. There are flavors of Kaki King's \"Night After Sidewalk\", or is it the other way around? Entrancing nevertheless.The Wheel and Driving are two songs that are very entertaining. They keep a good rhythm while being creatively written and are fun to listen to.Walk With Me does very well to convey the feeling of walking with your lover, beckoning them to spend some quality time with you. It's a very welcoming and easy listening song. Daydreamy and relaxing with the ambient guitar in the background.All in all, this is a fantastic album with a mix of musical styles and are excellently produced. This album is good for relaxing or while doing chores, indoors and out. I like to listen to this album while I'm riding my bike out on country roads, and it never gets old for me because the songs are so original and genuine. It is well worth the money for Will Ackerman fans, new and old alike.\n", "val": 0.03144454210996628}

The wait was worth it.  William Ackerman remains the most amazing talent. His music is healing, introspective, peaceful and sensitive. I will always be grateful for it being there to call on in difficult times.  It is never discordant or aggressive - it is chill out music without the electronica - everything sounds a little more authentic, a little more organic.  There's lots of variation so it's not just the solo guitar, but there are soulful voices, atmospheric violins, cello ...Don't forget to check out William's other albums Imaginary Roads, Conferring with the Moon, the Returning and on Hearing Voices there's a stunning cameo from one of the Rankin Family Sisters.

{"text": "I came across this today will browsing in a Target store while my wife was shopping. This is actually a repackaging of Ackerman's two most recent studio releases:  2008's MEDITATIONS and 2010's NEW ENGLAND ROADS. [Yes, these are Target exclusives (check out the Lifescapes kiosk) and are available in this 2-CD set for less than a Jackson. Of course, you have to pay more when using a third-party vendor.]There is no booklet, and the CD packaging is short on details other than providing the information as to which musicians appear on each track. Here's what I've been able to glean from Ackerman's website:MEDITATIONS contains seven new tracks:\"Zuzu's Petals\" (solo guitar)\"Believing in Miracles\"\"Up There Throughout the Skies\"\"Was It This Lifetime\"\"On One Knee\"\"When the Moon Sings\"\"West of Shoshone\"The other seven tracks  are \"previously recorded pieces with additional parts and orchestration,\" or in some cases, reinterpretations of previously recorded material. Among the latter are solo recordings of \"Pictures,\" \"Anne's Song\" and \"Processional.\" Of the former, Ackerman is joined by additional musicians including keyboardist (and former Windham Hill labelmate) Philip Aaberg. [Total Running Time - 72:15]NEW ENGLAND ROADS (Ackerman's most recent studio album) features mostly new recordings. One track, \"Driving,\" first appeared on 1998's SOUND OF WIND DRIVEN RAIN. None of these are solo guitar pieces. These songs include at times violin, percussion, horns and accordion. There is even a rare vocal (by Heather Rankin) on \"Walk with Me.\"  [Total Running Time - 50:20]I have been a fan of Ackerman's since his 1976 Windham Hill debut IN SEARCH OF THE TURTLE'S NAVEL. I was thrilled to (belatedly) discover these two releases at a reasonable price. Fans of Ackerman's guitar playing will enjoy the two-plus hours' of music contained on these two discs.

{"text": "I love The Birthday Massacre. I have been a fan for a few years now since I first heard of the band on a Cleopatra records compilation. Their song \"Video Kid\" was what got me hooked on the band. 4 or 5 years later, I find myself not saying that about the band's latest effort Pins & Needles. I never have been so disappointed in a band until now. Pins & Needles lacks the addictive pop hooks or originality that made me fall in love with them to begin with. I also found a few songs on the new album to be regurgitation of songs like \"Red Stars\" and \"Looking Glass\" from their previous full length album. Not very original IMO. I really did want to like Pins & Needles but sadly I did not nor can I recommend it either. I'll take the new Cylab and Unter Null cds over the new TBM cd any day.\n", "val": 3.78720105800312e-05}
{"text": "I happened to stumble upon The Birthday Massacre about three years ago.  I heard the song \"Happy Birthday\" and was instantly hooked!!  (Anyone born on the Ides of March, like me, can see the irony of that song) Needing more of that creepy, darkingly beautiful shoegazer sound, I went out and bought all the TBM albums.Nearly three years have passed since my ears first heard this amazing band and I was anxiously waiting for word on the next album.  Finally, a release date was set and I knew I would pre-order.  Of course, in the back of my mind I was wondering if they would be the same TBM I loved on first listen.  Hearing the samples of the songs, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.  I listened to the samples over and over waiting with bated breath until I got my hands on my very own copy.  The samples do NOT do the songs justice.Fans of The Birthday Massacre hear all the good aspects of past albums, but there is a great evolution in the texture and tempo of these current songs.  Stand out tracks for me are:  \"Always\", \"Pale\", \"Shallow Grave\", and \"Midnight,\" but EVERY song on here is impressive.If you are looking for new dream pop with a dark shadow peeking out from beneath the synths, then this album is well worth the money.\n", "val": 0.01832660287618637}
{"text": "It's been 3 years and Birthday Massacre is back!! The new album, 'Pins and Needles' is truly a solid effort and a solid album. I have been waiting patiently for Birthday Massacre to bring it with a new cd! After I fell in love with 'Walking With Strangers' I could not wait to see what direction the band would take. This album sounds a lot like the last one, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. This cd is truly a pleasant and very enjoyable album to listen to and it slakes my thirst for their music. This band is truly the best at what they do.The guitar sound has taken more of a forefront heavy approach and the melodic synth is present and is well done here. The recording quality of this album is slightly better than their last album \"Walking With Strangers.' The mix is very well mastered and all of the music sounds are there for the listening pleasure.Now I will say that this cd is not as catchy and doesn't pull me in as much as their last album. I was tempted to rate this cd as 5 stars because I really do enjoy and like the album, I guess I just have to be honest here. I hate this because I don't want to judge on their previous efforts but there it is. It'd be nice to give it a 4 1/2 stars because that's probably what I'd put.A few songs really just didn't stand out to me and I guess that's how it goes sometimes. Pale starts out really cool, and then just sort of drones on til the song ends. It's an ok song just not my favorite. 'Two hearts' is the only song on the album that I really don't like and I wish they would have removed it. It seems like there's no effort put in the song compared to all the others. It's boring, the chorus bugs me, and I skip it over almost every time. Other than these two, the rest of the songs on the album range from good to very good to \"I love this!\"I love the song 'Always!' It is so amazing! The album was worth buying for this one song alone. :) Pins and Needles is a great song as well!This album is great and I cheer the band's efforts although I'd like to see something a little different next time around. There is no doubt that I will continue to purchase Birthday Massacre's albums, for this band delivers a well placed feel, product, and unique sound.\n", "val": 0.011821123771369457}
{"text": "I only recently stumbled upon TBM's \"Walking with Strangers\" and instantly became hooked. A goth band with a punk presentation performing a melodic sort of 'Evanescence meets Gary Numan' wall of sound. There's nobody out there who does this better.'Pins and Needles' is an okay ride, but doesn't live up. The album as a whole sounds more like one long song than a collection. I'll keep listening to it and see if it ultimately sticks, but as far as I'm concerned now, 'Walking with Strangers' is TBM's signature effort.\n", "val": 0.0010328986681997776}
{"text": "If you like any previous Birthday Massacre albums, you definitely won't be disappointed by this one. It is a bit heavier on the guitar end, but I don't think the synths suffer for it. This is just as melodic as anything they've done before, though maybe not quite as dark. Also, while some songs are extremely catchy (Pins and Needles, for example), I'd say this album is less catchy overall. Some of the songs, while good, don't quite stand out. For that reason, I'm not sure I would rank this album above their last effort, Walking with Strangers. Still, this is a solid collection and I'm definitely glad I purchased it. The opener, \"In the Dark,\" is one of their best songs to date, while \"Shallow Grave\" and \"Control\" are a joy to listen to.If you're at all curious about buying this album, go ahead and do yourself a favor. Buy it now. If we don't support good music like this, it just might go away.*** UPDATE on JANUARY 12, 2010 ***After giving this album a few months' listening time, I have decided that it is not only my favorite Birthday Massacre album, but one of my favorite albums in general. It has remained in my car stereo for weeks. Every time I try listening to something else, I find myself missing this album. Seriously. It's good.

{"text": "For those that know The Birthday Massacre, this album will come as no surprise. You will like what is there and you will feel Chibi's voice take you to that happy listening place. For those who don't know it, it is Canadian exported gold in the disquise of music. It has all the stuff you want, too, ranging from a nice beat that can be electronic or heavy or somewhere in-between. It also has a dark feel sometimes and a light emotive feel other times - that's the lead singer's touch. With some female singers, bringing something is a problem. With others, feeling something is almost a sing. Chibi is a thing that exists in both places, making her mark in such a great way. Give the band a listen and really check out the lyircal work - everything is here from the style to the motions.I realy liked the feel of this new Birthday Massacre. I had feared it initially, hearing how the album would be heavier and how the symposium of vocals-instruments would change somewhat BUT it is still TBM. Pins and Needles shows you that right away, too, with some really great songs. In fact, there are some songs that rival a lot of Walking with Strangers on here, bringing back some of the darkness.When it comes to TBM, the thing that really does them service is the fact that they stay the same and change all in the same motion. You can see them in all their work - I am happy that I can say that - but you can hear them grow as a band as well. They have also stayed out of the manstream enough to be enjoyable BUT have some songs that would definately make them airwave darling. Sadly, the radio around here has no love for anything with a beat.There's no reason not to buy. In fact, just do it and be happy. I could say more but won't, knowing your ears are the one reviewing product that matters.\n", "val": 0.010018900036811829}
{"text": "Like the last reviewer said, this album doesn't offer anything new for fans of The Birthday Massacre but it is yet another top notch production with a few small differences. The music is more uplifting & less brooding this time around (which is fine by me regardless) AND the most obvious difference is the scary death vox which singer Chibi uses quite a bit in previous releases are not present on this release whatsoever. It seems obvious to me that The Birthday Massacre are trying not necessarily to evolve but to mature as an artist & honestly Chibi's voice is so sweet to the ears that the harsh vocals do her injustice so I'm not too disappointed that she is not using them on this CD. Fans go out & buy another EXCELLENT album from this band!\n", "val": 0.01889529637992382}
{"text": "On Pins & Needles, Birthday Massacre manage to become both heavier and melodic at the same time. Well, heavier in regards to their guitar sound anyway. Their trademark arpeggiated synth sound is still in full force as is their sense for melancholy lyrics. To put it simply, if Walking With Strangers had been a double album, Pins & Needles could have been the second disc. There doesnt seem to be any new styles approached on this record, rather it is another set of great dark and poppy industrial rock songs. Nothing wrong with that. The album has a cohesive feel and listeners will be starving for more after the last track. The only downside is that I'm partial to them ending their records on a solemn note like the last album. However, on this record the album ends with a more upbeat number, which gives the album an overall rockin' vibe. Great Alice In Wonderland-esque artwork as usual too. This album was made for the fans of the band and will definitely satisfy the music lover looking for some accessible pop that still retains a dark edge not found on the radio. Highlights include Always, Shallow Grave, and Secret, but the whole album flows as one piece of art which more than makes up for the short running time.Great album worth picking up. :)\n", "val": 0.014495842158794403}

Now, I wouldn't say that this album is any heavier than their previous album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Walking-with-Strangers/dp/B000UGG34G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Walking with Strangers</a>, but \"In The Dark\" is certainly one of their heaviest (and catchiest) offerings. The rest of the songs on this album are great as well (though my particular favorites include \"Sideways\", \"Secret\", \"Midnight\", \"Sleepwalking\", \"Pale\" and \"Always\"). Really my only complaint is that I wish they would have included \"Shiver\" on this album, since I don't want to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Looking-Glass/dp/B0016MJ2KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Looking Glass</a>&nbsp;for just one song. But I'd love to have it on a full album.I must also take this opportunity to recommend the band I mentioned above called The Panic Division (since they are tragically unknown) and I really think that fans of The Birthday Massacre would enjoy them as well.

{"text": "Like most people are saying - this is not a major departure from Walking With Strangers.  The band is certainly shifting the focus towards guitar more and more.  There is less of the fantasy type songs from their earlier efforts.Chibi has really come into her own vocally.  However, I do like the variety of vocal style on previous efforts, like her venom spitting vocals on Blue.  They do experiment with vocal effects on Control, which really end up highlighting her normal voice because it has a really cool way of cutting through.Always has a cool vocal melody that reminds me of 80's Rush for a second.  Not to say that this band is anything like Rush, but sometimes things just strike you out of nowhere.Shallow Grave spotlights Chibi's Madonna style IMO.One thing missing from this album for me is that there is no all out heavy song like Blue, Broken or Red Stars.  Pins And Needles and Sleepwalking probably come the closest.  I actually REALLY like Sleepwalking.  Cool mix of Chibi's little girl vocals, her powerful vocals, heavy industrial riff, and a nifty little drum flourish sound.  I would really love this song if I thought the drummer did that drum flourish live with double bass drums but that may be a little too metal for TBM.The only song that I am not particularly a fan of is Secret.  I think they could have left it off or done something better like they did with Movie.  I am not a huge fan of ballads anyway, so I would not have any problem if they had replaced this song with some a little harder.Overall, TBM fans will like this.  If you are new to the band, I would suggest starting with Violet which was their pinnacle IMO.  It was the perfect marriage of their fantasy element with their more straight up rock band side.  From there, I would listen to the earlier and later stuff.  Definitely do not forget to check out Nothing And Nowhere too.  I think getting these albums first will help put Walking With Strangers and Pins And Needles into better context.

A lot of their feel reminds me of something like the movie Dark Crystal meets The Nightmare Before Christmas set to an industrial 80s rock soundtrack... and I find that to be quite praiseworthy!So do these guys (and gal) still have it? Does 'Pins & Needles' measure up to their previous works? Let's jump right into some questions that may be floating around your mind about this release if you've reached this page and you're on the fence about whether or not to plunk down your hard-earned bucks on the new album:1). \"I'm new to these guys. I've heard the samples and they sound interesting. What should I do? Start here or look at their other work first?A: If you liked the samples, then you really can't go wrong with any of their releases. Although if you're looking for the best place to begin, I'd say check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Violet/dp/B000A2H7YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Violet</a>&nbsp;first and followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Walking-with-Strangers/dp/B000UGG34G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Walking with Strangers</a>, then proceed onto this one and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nothing-Nowhere/dp/B000PSJCMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nothing & Nowhere</a>. Both the former albums combined have a lot of memorable tracks with plenty of variety to them. Their sound is pretty much as I described above (80's style darkwave pop with metal guitars and an industrial edge). So if that all sounds like a good combination to you, I say go for it and take the plunge into the world of TBM!2). \"I've never liked TBM. Will this release change my mind?\"A: Sorry to say this, but if you didn't care for their previous works, then Pins & Needles won't really do anything to turn you into a fan. They still incorporate much of the same heavy synth backdrops with metal guitars and they still sing about nightmares, bedtime stories, lost love, & anything related to after dark. So if that's not your thing, I'd say save your money and look elsewhere. However, chances are most of you who reach this page are already fans of their other works, so this info is really only for the few who have never liked TBM to begin with and are hoping for a change.3). \"Nothing & Nowhere, Violet, and Walking With Strangers changed my life! I love these guys and have everything ever released by TBM. Is this still the same awesome band?A: Of course, no worries there! Chibi still belts out her same awesome style of goosebump-inducing melodic vocals. She doesn't use the whispering/growling that she had on past songs like \"Happy Birthday\", but other than that I feel her vocals have actually improved a bit. And the rest of the band is as great as ever. Lyrics are pretty much the same as always. The synths will have you recalling all their previous works all the while giving you more to love about their sound. Most likely, if you fall into this camp, you have 'Pins & Needles' in your collection already, so I don't need to tell you twice to go grab it!4). \"I enjoyed most everything TBM has put out over the years, and seeing as they're 3 albums in now, I'm looking for them to evolve and try something new. Rehashing leads to creative stagnation. Are we gonna get any real innovation this time around?\"A: Not really. TBM haven't done anything drastic like switching genres, selling out, going rap, adding extra instruments, writing longer songs, incorporating orchestras, experimenting with different song structures, and whatever else you can think of that sounds unlike TBM. Fact of the matter is, even though they've only had a couple of real albums, TBM have found their niche and as the saying goes: \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" The band doesn't seem to care about altering their sound, and as such they're sticking to what they do best. I think it would be cool for them to change it up a little bit, though I don't feel there's anything wrong with what they're making now, especially if what they're still creating is done REALLY well. I suppose the closest thing to innovation might be the drum beat they incorporate throughout 'In the Dark', which is unique for them. So if you're looking for something ground-breakingly different with 'Pins & Needles', you'll probably be disappointed. Nevertheless, I still say go check it out. I mean, what have you got to lose? At the very least, you'll just end up with \"another Birthday Massacre album\". You could honestly do a lot worse.5). \"I've heard that this album's songwriting isn't as strong this time around and these new songs aren't as catchy as before. Is this true?\"A: Well, yes and no. In terms of catchiness, this set probably won't grab you as immediately as the previous albums do upon initial listens (in other words, there's nary a song that hooks you in quite the same way as, say... 'Horror Show' or 'Weekend'... with the exception of perhaps the awesome 'Midnight'). However, I've listened to this album a good 10 times already, and each time I hear it the songs do get better and better. I've noticed that the guitars have bigger crunch, the production is slightly better than 'Strangers', and the melodies add more billowy texture and subtle sounds that you don't catch the first time around. So 'Pins & Needles' will take a little more patience to get into. There were 1 or 2 songs towards the second half that felt a little meh to me at first, but even those opened up eventually.6). \"So what are your thoughts on Pins & Needles?\"A: Overall, I quite enjoyed this new album. While it's not really innovative for them, seeing as how they've held this exact sound together for the span of their discography, that still doesn't bother me because it's all done extremely well. I've found so much to like about what's here -- gorgeously lush rocking melodies and solid songwriting that grabs you over time. Upon the first listen, I really liked \"Pale\", \"Shallow Grave\" and especially the faster \"Midnight\". That one definitely gave me the warm fuzzies! Other highlights that won me over are \"In The Dark\", \"Always\" and the ending ballad \"Secret\". It's not absolutely perfect, as there are a few spots that lose my attention here and there, but it's usually not for long. So do give it a few spins before you judge it.And there you have it, I hope this review has been helpful. I wish I had some other band/album recommendations, but so far I haven't found anything that I can honestly say sounds just like them. If anyone has any ideas, let me know and I'll post them here.\n", "val": 0.007700012996792793}

No matter what they did though, they've always had a very powerful sound...so, this album completely threw me off.My two best friends and I are Combichrist fangirls...but we found ourselves frowning through pretty much the entire album. This is a very watered down, depressed Combichrist. Boring, generic beats and Andy's \"singing voice\" makes me cringe. When I listen to old albums, I get excited. I feel like raging and dancing until I die, and it never gets old. Where with Making Monsters, I find myself to be indifferent through most of it. Throat Full Of Glass makes me feel like I'm sitting in a shobby bar, alone and miserable on a rainy day. I really hate to say all of those things because I don't want to believe that the same group that got me into the scene is the same one that made this catastrophe of an album.I love when a band or artist changes it up but, this isn't good.

{"text": "It's a good thing this band has a strong back catalogue, because otherwise this album would be invisible in the mountain of similar generic, unremarkable electronic music made by newbies. I'm sorry, but this is just not good Combichrist. Many of the songs are slow, plodding messes without any hooks or contagious sounds. Not interesting, not powerful, not threatening, just as bland as sonic hands-full of dough. Andy has an awful singing voice--it's weak, it's very much out of tune, and yet he tries and tries to sing on so many tracks! Andy's voice is made for industrial-strength shouting, like in \"Sent to Destroy\" and \"All Pain is Gone\"--THOSE are killer songs. Andy's sounding more tired here.There are a few stabs of harder songs, but they're not actually very interesting. F---machine is an un-creative as they come: heap misogyny and abuse on a woman, tell her she deserves it--that's the whole song. It's crap. It's trite. It's not rebellious, it's typical woman-hating sexism without even the benefit of any interesting music (just a bunch of loops piled on top of each other to accompany Andy's rather wretched and SERIOUSLY disappointing sexism). Hey Andy: abusing women isn't edgy. It's not creative. It's not sexy. It's not fun. It's not even shocking. It makes you seem like a tool. It's just dull.So there it is--the album I've awaited more eagerly than any other this year, and it's dull. Sure, some Combichrist fans will suck up to it, telling Andy another thousand times how awesome he is, but come on...they know. They *know* this album is weak. The songs are sludgy and so generic that only a couple are even conspicuous. They *know* Andy's singing voice stinks (but apparently nobody was brave enough to tell him that). This sounds like a gazillion other electro-industrial bands you've never heard of because they weren't noticeable, now forgotten in random COP and Cleopatra catalogues of 1994.\n", "val": 1.8822262063622475e-05}

This is a much slower album without the same raw aggression I have come to know and love from this band. In addition, I found myself thinking that the tracks sounded quite similar. Don't get me wrong, I am glad that I purchased this album even if just for the \"good\" tracks, but this is not the album you want to buy if you are listening to Combichrist for the first time.

It's pleasant-sounding, but not all that impactful.\"Healing In Your Arms\" is a brisk song. It deserves a mention, but I don't hear it on the radio anymore.My favorite has to be \"Come Home;\" it has warmth and good music, too. The lyrics are fresh yet familiar.Really, the next songs, \"What I Live For\" and \"All I Want,\" are skippable. \"Hope Is Rising\" sounds like \"Atmosphere,\" but the latter is better than the former. It has atmosphere and nice harmonies by Kate York.\"New Beginnings\" is the inspirational song on the album, saying \"Let's chase a new horizon,\" but I think I've heard this song before...\"On Your Side\" and \"Stay With Me\" somehow sound similar, though technically they are not. Funky-sounding in some way, but still weaker songs in my opinion.The penultimate is definitely the surprising hit on this album. It's a country song, essentially, in ballad form. It sounds country, at least. Nice solo by Stu G.The last song, \"This Is Love,\" sounds like it could be sung at a campfire or outside. It's a rustic, big, but slow song.Summary:The LUMINATE EP and their new album, COME HOME, are different. The first was passionate; but while the lyrics are of similar quality, COME HOME is dozy.Put another way:Wake up with LUMINATE EP...  Wind down with COME HOME.\n", "val": 0.0044453744776546955}

{"text": "Passport was no doubt one of the best known fusion groups to come out of Germany. I have to say I am not big on fusion, but on occasions, I find an album that grabs me. Like this 1975 album from Passport. Cross-Collateral (1975) was not their second album, it was their fifth, but it was only their second American release. Looking Thru (1974) was their first U.S. release. They already had three albums previous to Looking Thru, Hand Made (1973), Second Passport (1972) and Doldinger (1971, the big anomaly in the Passport catalog as to having Amon Duul II members helping out).By Looking Thru, the group finally had a stable lineup that would last them around three or four years, and of course a string of albums fans of the band most associate Passport with. The lineup consisted of saxist/keyboardist Klaus Doldinger (who was born in 1936, meaning he was knocking around the music business since the 1950s, and Passport was simply his 1970s and '80s project), drummer Curt Cress (who you'll find on nearly every other German prog rock album from Atlantis to Trimvirat), keyboardist Kristian Schultze, and bassist/guitarist Wolfgang Schmidt. I really think that Cross-Collateral is certainly a high point in the career in Passport (of the albums I've heard, as I hadn't heard any of their pre-Looking Thru albums, and I was warned about the stuff they did after Infinity Machine). \"Homunculus\" is a wonderful number, dominated by clavinet, and some nice themes played by Doldinger's sax. The title track is a real interesting one as it goes through several changes from wild and experimental to more mellow passages and funky passages with clavinet. It's truly an amazing piece. \"Jadoo\" continues on the wild, intense ride, while the band starts mellowing out with the next three cuts, which are still quite wonderful. \"Will-O'-the-Wisp\" features more clavinet and a nice sax theme from Doldinger. Here Doldinger includes some Mellotron. \"Albatross Song\" includes more nice sax playing and some Mellotron buried in the background. Most fusion groups would simply shy away from the Mellotron (like Weather Report or Mahavishnu Orchestra, although Jan Hammer did use one on his solo album The First Seven Days - but that was more of a prog rock/electronic album than fusion), probably because you can't show off on that instrument, unlike an electric piano, Mini Moog and Hohner D-6 clavinet. But at least Klaus Doldinger didn't have a problem with the Mellotron (although he used it more on their previous album, Looking Thru, and apparently earlier albums too) and that's nice to hear the instrument in this genre of music. The band really mellows out with the last piece \"Damals\" in a wonderful fashion, this time more piano dominated, but the sax is still there.A must for those who are in to fusion (and even me who isn't big on that kind of music).\n", "val": 0.018497301265597343}
{"text": "This is another great album to come out of the incredibly diverse 1970s German music scene.  Interestingly enough, although this 1975 album is a jazz-rock album, it is loosely tied to the German experimental rock scene (in my mind at any rate) in that Passport shared a producer with bands such as the Cosmic Jokers - namely, Deiter Dierks.  The production quality by the way, is stellar.The musicians on this album include bandleader Klaus Doldinger (tenor and soprano saxes, mini-moog synthesizer, electric piano, and mellotron); incredible drummer Curt Cress; Wolfgang Schmid (Rickenbacker bass and acoustic guitar on Damals); and Kristian Schulze (Fender electric piano and Hammond organ).There are six pieces on the album and range in length from 4'38\" to 13'38\".  Stylistically, the album is mostly jazz rock, but there are elements of progressive rock scattered here and there.  That is to say that the rhythms and chord structures are not always jazzy, and that melodies are used more often than is characteristic of most jazz rock.  There is also the choice of instrumentation, which includes the mini-moog and most notably the mellotron, which is used on Albatross Song.  Although synthesizers were being used by other jazz rock groups around this time including Return to Forever, their use on Cross-Collateral seems somewhat more...British.  Furthermore, the bassist's decision to use a trebly, punchy Rickenbacker bass rather than, say a fretless Fender jazz bass, was unusual.In a nutshell, the performances by all of the musicians are superb, especially those by Billy Cobham influenced drummer Curt Cress.  In fact, many of the pieces seem to revolve around the drummer!  The pieces are all well put together, develop nicely, and are diverse with respect to dynamics and overall timbre.  This album is highly recommended along with the 1974 release \"Looking Thru\".  In fact, I would urge prog heads who don't mind jazz rock to check this album out - the folks on the Gibraltar Encyclopedia of prog rock page had some very nice things to say about it.\n", "val": 0.02653507888317108}

I showed my 16 year old and she loved it too! I had only heard the one song \"For The First Time\" when I ordered the CD. I still love that one but \"Nothing\" is also a favorite of mine.

The guitar and lyrics are reminisent of \"the Who\" and other bands of that era, re-emerging in todays media.Truly worthy of following as they develop their unique genre of sound.\n", "val": 0.030846791341900826}

{"text": "This is a rocky album. Not in the 'it rocks' meaning of the word, but more in the sense that The Script deals with upheaval in love and politics. The trio of Dubliners waste no time in going for the gut with the opening \"You Won't Feel a Thing,\" which deals more with the austerity measures that Ireland is going through than a breakup. These former boy-banders have more on their mind than getting the girl; U2 echoes throughout \"Science and Faith.\"Too bad that \"You Won't Feel A Thing\" is the best song here. The Script know their way around solid melodies and good hooks, but they are smoothies from the school that also includes OneRepublic (they used to work with Ryan Tedder as producers), Snow Patrol and even Coldplay. The single \"Walk Away\" does make for good radio fodder, and the fine \"This = Love\" being the only song that really breaks the formula. Heck, \"Walk Away\" even features a rap cameo from B.o. B. in the 'everyone else is doing it' category. If you get the extended version, you'll likely enjoy the piano based and rapless version more, if only for the reason that the rap version sounds more of the moment than of the band.That said, \"Science and Faith\" is pretty decent overall. There are moments that suggest The Script could break the rut and maybe find their way into Coldplay's creativity or (if they were willing to get away from the over-production) Maroon 5's pop-soul. Just too many times on \"Science and Faith,\" you keep wishing for the big payoff when all you get are little fireworks of inspiration.\n", "val": 0.006506555713713169}

Knowing someone out there is feeling what I'm feeling is a really nice reminder! Sometimes when your just stuck, and feel lost people need music that they can connect to and Science & Faith does just that. This album gives you heartache, loneliness, and hope all in one! If you are looking for real talent, great music, and a reminder that you aren't the only one out there, do yourself a favor and buy this album! Instead of listening to some auto-tuned junk, with a chorus that repeats over and over again, listen to Science & Faith an album that tells a story in just 12 tracks. The Script have summed up some crazy feelings into beautiful music, that I didn't even think could be summed up into words.  This album is incredible, and I can't wait to see what's more to come!

{"text": "These guys are great. I really enjoyed their first album, and this one is no different. I will be able keep my typically long winded review structure in check with this one.Each song really does stand out on this album in its own way. They're well crafted songs and the album structure works well. Thematically, I dug this album all around. Love, loss, economy, hard times, etc...these guys are great at finding topics to sing about. Is it a little generic when compared to other stuff out there? Sure. But they sing and play with conviction so it doesn't sound repetitive or like they're one trick ponies.Okay, *deep breath* I have one complaint about this album I need to get out. These guys have great songwriting chops. I won't deny that. The one thing that, for me, keeps this from being a five star album is the production. Nearly every time these guys reach a chorus or something it EXPLODES with noise that is not necessary.Some of these songs don't need such lavish polishing. It's like the producer was in the studio just yelling \"WE NEED MORE LAYERS OF NOISE! IT'S NEVER ENOUGH!\" I want to hear some more stripped down arrangements here. These guys seem like they can play, and their songs have some genuine emotion to them, but I feel it gets lost in the \"mass of noise.\"For example- the chorus on \"For the First Time\" is RIDICULOUSLY overdone with extra layers. Honestly, when I hear the song and look at the lyrics- I'm thinking \"hard times, young love, they don't have much...that should be a song with less in terms of polish and extras. The song can reflect the theme!\" I ain't sayin' we need to go as far Rick Rubin did with Johnny Cash or anything, but c'mon- let me HEAR THE BAND!Anyways, I didn't mean to go on a tangent there- it just sorta happened. Overall, my point is this- should you get this cd? Sure, or at least the mp3's! For those of you digging the songs you hear on the radio from these guys- you won't be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.00013170197780709714}

{"text": "The Script is a band that was enveloped in buzz since their first single no less than a year ago. It was probably one of the first bands since the Cranberries to make a big splash in the states from Ireland. Although, their first release made its mark in terms of song style and musicianship, the album as a whole was only good, but not great.Now, The Script are back again with 'Science & Faith' I was a little skeptical considering their first single off this album pretty much sounded like their first album, but once I gave the whole album a listen I was blown away. This band has definitely picked up the slack and perfected their work. Using incredible hooks in their guitar work and a unique mix of melody and rhyme The Script are now stronger than ever before. 'Science & Faith' is an awesome listen from start to finish every song is great, yet as always there are those that step above the others. The self titled track, 'If You Ever Come Back' & 'Long Gone' are just a few of the great songs you will hear and believe it or not 'For the First Time' is probably the weakest on the album. It's very much like the first 3EB album (meaning Semi-Charmed Life while it was a popular single was the worst song on the record) The sound of this band has changed a great deal they definitely picked a few good pieces from bands like U2, R.E.M. & others. I highly recommend this album if you just want a great listen from start to finish, because that is exactly what is. I am now officially a fan of The Script and I am very eager to see where their work will take them in the future.\n", "val": 0.007902499288320541}
{"text": "It's not always easy to match a good, solid first album and the public's expectations after it, but The Script has been able to maintain and in my opinion even improve the quality of their sound with this second release. And funny enough, I almost didn't purchase it! I initially came across the CD on Amazon and hadn't known there even was a second album out, so needless to say, I was excited. But there didn't seem to be many tracks and the few clips I heard left me hesitant and wondering if it was worthwhile. I ended up purchasing the version with bonus tracks with a gift certificate given to me, and I am really glad I did. I would have missed on on some great music by a band that has easily become one of my favorites.Although I very much liked the first album and found their style very versatile, I wasn't sure if I was completely sold on the fact that it was fully their own, simply because some of their sound felt familiar and reminded me of things I had heard before. Having said that, Danny's voice was distinct. I recognized it as Breakeven played faintly in a store (I had never heard the song before, and had only heard part of The Script's \"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\" on the radio once). And I look back and think the variety was good for them and was part of their appeal. But this second album was like a concretization of their own signature sound and a great reinforcement of that fact. I also think this album is a bit more consistent in terms of style, while their first album was perhaps more diverse.In all fairness, I have to admit I still haven't fully warmed up to the last three songs on the album (four technically, but two are the same, just slightly different versions). When I initially listened to them more attentively, I was reading the lyrics at the same time and was a bit disappointed that the album ended on somewhat of a down note, but I still really love the album overall and am enthusiastic about giving it 5 stars. I also think I can grow to like the other songs I haven't listened to enough yet.~I won't give a thorough review of each song as I think it's best to discover them yourself, but here are a few short comments:\"You Won't Feel a Thing\" wasn't one of the songs I was drawn to most initially. It felt a bit chaotic at times when the chorus hit (may not be a song to discover when you are tired or stressed), but it has actually become one of my favorites.\"For the First Time\" was the first official single off the album and it is a good song, though not necessarily one of my top listens.\"Nothing\" is a great song that captures the desperate, delusional and pitiful state of someone after a break-up who is drunk and is convinced if they just go to see the person or confess their love (alcohol and confessing of love: rarely a good combination!), the person will change their mind. So they dial the number and speak the words, only to be hit with the harsh reality of silence at the other end of the line. A song that is both sad and makes you want to laugh because of its realistic nature (the 2nd verse paints the picture well).\"Science and Faith\": Good chorus and good solid song about love and how it is one thing that cannot be explained through science but is simply felt.\"If You Ever Come Back\" is a hopeful song about possibly regaining a love that was lost. Great chorus to sing along to.\"Long Gone and Moved On\": The poor guy! lol Another good solid song that displays more of a raspy tone in Danny's voice.\"Dead Man Walking\": Great melody and catchy chorus that I find myself singing when I'm not listening to the album.\"This=Love\": Universal song about love and how and why it keeps us going and doing the things we do.\"Walk Away\": One that I need to listen to more. It has good rhythm but doesn't seem to deviate as much melodically. It is also not the most uplifting song.\"Exit Wounds\": Have not listened to this enough yet but think I can grow to like it.\"Bullet From a Gun\": Once again have not listened to this enough but will give it a fair chance.~I was really pleased with the album when I first started listening to it, and now, after having had it for a while, am still loving it. It is great to be able to enjoy a second album as much as the first, and perhaps even more. It's a good one to put on, let play and enjoy. In my opinion, those of you who enjoyed the first won't be disappointed with Science and Faith. Great lyrics, melodies, and Danny's distinct voice that you know and love.\n", "val": 0.0005566891632042825}

{"text": "Loved The Script's first album, was on it while it was still in Europe, getting all my friends and family into it. Saw them touring and was seriously concerned they toured to the point of hurting lead singer Danny's pipes. I have seen them do a lot of bad versions of their songs on TV shows where I thought they should shine. If he hasn't done permanent damage, he is sure risking it, though I know they are pushing hard to get established... Its just that his voice is truly special and I worry that he is doing himself in long-term.This album is not anywhere near as good as their debut. I see they are now getting b.o.b. to punch up Walk Away, as For the First Time peters out on the charts. That may be necessary, as the other songs on this album are basically throw-aways. I bought the actual CD when it came out overseas and now am frustrated, as well, as only one of the bonus tracks is available to download. I am not re-buying the CD and the only other song I am interested in is not available. My reward for being anxious to get their new CD before it came out in the states is now I have to re-buy the product to get all the songs. The Script told a friend of mine they only sing songs they pen themselves. I fear they have used up all their good stuff on the first album.Frustrated by the quality of the songs and that I can not download this bonus track by itself...I hope they take a rest, let Danny's voice come back, and solicit a few songs from quality writers outside the group, so that they can get together a great third album. I like this band a lot, so this was a true disappointment.\n", "val": 2.2213373085833155e-05}

{"text": "There are many bands out n' about today that you almost get lost in counting. However there are very few who are actually worth listening to. The Script hasn't been in the spot light for long and this is just their second album but I think we'll be hearing from these guys more often in the future. After the release of songs like 'Breakeven', 'Live Like Where Dying' (Yup No offense Kris Allen Fans but this song is originally sang but The Script) and 'The Man Who Can't Be Moved' from their first debut album, this album comes as a 'pleasant surprise' and with even better lyrics.1- \"For The First Time\" : So you think the title suites a love song huh ? Think again, this song is actually about the Economical Depression in Ireland. Which makes it all the better along with the beautiful Lyrics, its one of my personal favorite :) 5/52-\"You Wont' Feel A Thing\" : This song has a catchy intro to it. Though I can't say its one of my favorite on this album but still a good song nether less ! Worth listening to 3.5/53- \"Nothing\" : The Poor guy is going through a breakup trying to forget his love he knows he's better without her but even \"a few drinks\" can't seem to make him forget her. Beautiful Song, really touching and another personal favorite 5/54- \"Science & Faith\" : The song that the album's titled after. Pretty much a comparison between a Scientist's POV and a Believer's POV and their outlook on Love/Life etc.. A Great Song, really beautiful lyrics and Unique ! Another personal favorite 5/55- \" If You Ever Come Back\" : Suffering the aftermath of a bad breakup, Your Lover just break it off with you and you can't seem to let go ? This song is for you ! It's all about asking forgiveness and wanting another chance and just simply starting over. Once again Beautiful Lyrics, Great Song. One of my personal Favorite ! 5/56- \" Long Gone And Moved On\" : It may have been months or even years but he just can't seem to get over his ex however that's all about to change because today he's finally moving On and leaving the memories behind. Very Well Written, A touching song and kinda sad. One of my personal Favorite 5/57- \"Dead Man Walking\" : Beautiful Song, Beautiful Lyrics ( I told you the lyrics in this album are just Incredible) Once again the Science/Faith theme is implied in here and the result is well quite frankly beautiful ! 4.5/58- \" Walk Away\" : Catchy Song, A little bit different from The other songs in this album. But its quite refreshing, this is the closest it'll ever get to fast-paced songs in this album which is by the standards of modern days R and B, Pop etc.. is slow but if you bought this album then I guess you wouldn't mind that ! 4.5/59- \"This=Love\" : What is Love ? This song tries to explain that. Great Lyrics ! Has kinda of a Slow R n B verse towards the end.  Vampire Diaries used this song in one of their episodes. A Personal Favorite 5/510- \"Exit Wounds\" : A Great conclusion ! About letting your wounds out and just relaxing ! Another Good Song 4.5/5Note: I know that there is a (Deluxe Version) released with extra songs just recently However I didn't review them because I didn't buy the Deluxe Version but that doesn't mean that these are all the songs that this album has to offer.To Put it in one word this album has been \"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G\" ! The Lyrics are Beautiful, the songs have meanings to them and the singers are talented ! This is more than I would ask for in an Album, I normally don't Buy an entire album because I rarely like ALL the songs included, However this album has been an exception ! Its just one of those Albums who you can play over and over again and it never gets old and you don't really have to skip to the better songs because all the songs are worth listening to. I personally played it constantly for like a month. So if there was just One album that you could buy in this year I would recommend you pick this album up ! Believe the reviews, what you see is what you get :) Irish Bands with similar songs I would recommend :<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Westlife/dp/B00004RHZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Westlife</a>\n", "val": 0.008980361744761467}

It showed that the guys from Ireland know how to make great melodies, with just a bit of chemistry. Sadly though I wish I could've said it a little better with their latest single, Nothing, the second single from their sophmore album Science & Faith. The song is alright, but not anything to rave about. It just wasn't as strong as some of their other hits were.

{"text": "As one who hadn't listened to much of Sanctus Real's music as of about six months ago, the Pieces of Our Past anthology was certainly a favorable option for me after finally listening to (and absolutely loving) some of their recent hits like \"Forgiven\" and \"The Redeemer.\" The price was right at $20 for three albums, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest by these three fantastic recordings. Each one is great in its own distinct way, and listening to the three records clearly shows the band's growth over the years between these albums.Sanctus' 2004 release, Fight the Tide, is the first to be featured on this anthology, showing the band at their heavy rocking finest. Though the other two albums on this record are musically stronger and more diverse, Fight the Tide is probably the most fun to listen to. \"Everything About You\" and \"Closer\" are fantastic, worshipful rockers, \"The Fight Song\" and \"Things Like You (Everyone's Everything)\" make great points about how we should live as believers, \"Deeds\" cleverly covers the concept of salvation by faith, and just about every song on the album is just plain fun to listen to. Fight the Tide serves as a strong and entertaining, though not especially diverse, start to the anthology.The Face of Love is next, showing some remarkable musical growth and lyrical transparency from the band. Album opener \"I'm Not Alright\" might still be the band's best song with its incredibly honest lyrics and tight musical execution.  A higher level of musical diversity characterizes the record with quieter gems like the moving closer \"Benjamin\" and the title track finding a home alongside more rockers like \"Possibilities\" and \"We're Trying.\" Overall, The Face of Love is rock solid and a great indicator of the band's growth.Finally, the excellent We Need Each Other rounds out the collection with some of the strongest songs of the lot. Matt Hammitt shows his vocal versatility more than ever before with his well-executed pseudo-screams in the infectious rocker \"Turn On the Lights\" contrasted by the softer, more touching moments of songs like \"Whatever You're Doing (Something Heavenly)\" and \"Lay Down My Guns.\" Furthermore, \"Sing\" is a wonderful worship tune, the title track is catchy and makes a great point about how we do indeed need each other, and \"Legacy\" ends the album well with a strong sense of determination to show Christ to the world.Longtime Sanctus Real fans probably have no reason to purchase Pieces of Our Past, seeing as it doesn't offer any bonus tracks that weren't previously available in some form (even the included alternate version of \"Everything About You\" is on the regular iTunes release of Fight the Tide). However, if you are unfamiliar with Sanctus Real's work before their most recent release and all the attention they've garnered from songs like \"Lead Me\" and \"Forgiven,\" then you really should invest in this wonderful anthology. You get three fantastic albums for just $20 (or less if you get it here on Amazon) when they are most certainly worth full price, and for that reason this release is more than welcome in the end.\n", "val": 0.04868999868631363}

Some of my favorites:Ego (Catchy intro riff guitar/synth)New World Shadows (Favorite on the CD)Soul Journeys (Another great intro awesome riff the song glides on)Watcher of the Skies (Only Instrumental on the CD and it's a good one)Deep Cold (All the elements from the CD packed into a strong finish)With the exception of the first half of An Infinite Mind (Death vocal whispers...), the CD as a whole is just a great listen if you're into melodic death of any kind.\n", "val": 0.017183303833007812}

Baby Mama ( which also appeared on the Baby Boy soundtrack ) is another tight song,  2-Way Freak is another in the long list of the Three Six Mafia's classic songs and it also has a tight chorus.  U Got Da Game Wrong is another Chickenhead esque Battle of The Sexes.  We Shootin 1st is tight and Slang N Serve feat. T-Rock represents for the ATL, T-Rock just basically rips the track to shreds; a classic.The best song has to be Dis B!tch Dat Ho feat. Ludacris.  It is the ultimate party song with a catchy and unforgettable chorus.  Ludacris gets the thang crunk for real,; his flow his off the chain.

Most of her selections are traditionally chanted in ritual situations but she takes these and allows them to flow directly from the heart, at one and the same time transcending tradition and sublimating it. They are irresistible in this form, compelling, moving, uplifting and liberating all at the same time. Her pronunciation is absolutely flawless. Her interpretation of each is completely perfect. I feel completely and totally fulfilled after listening to each rendition and am continuously surprised that there is something following it as the album could very well end with each selection and I would still feel satisfied. It is truly an amazing experience.  I am telling everyone I know, get this album and listen to it over and over again.\n", "val": 0.05663789063692093}

{"text": "I got this based on a `recommendation', and the samples that I listened to, showed real promise. I am happy to say I have been really blown away (not in a seedy way mind). This is a 6 track e.p. from the five piece new band, and it is a remarkable effort. The opener `Colours' sets the pace and most of the tone; we have jangly guitars, lovely swirling lyrics, and great harmonies.Track two, `Naked kids' has even got hand claps, which is just great, the mood slows down a bit for `Goldcoast', this has a kind of Okkervil River feel, but is still distinctive enough to be their own, with a driving beat and great catchy hook, it really is note perfect. `Getaway Car', is another great tune, and by this time, I was starting to think I have found the first great summer record of 2011. A word about the lyrics, they are all interesting enough to make you know you have to give repeated listening, to get all the messages and tales that lie within. I do hate clichs like rhyming `dove' with `love' etc. And, am happy to say that Grouplove avoid all that. And it keeps sounding better on subsequent listenings.They have great backing vocals too and come from Los Angeles, founded by Christian Zucconi and Hannah Hooper (who does all the very nice artwork too!) Track 5 `Don't say oh well' is probably my favourite, because it is just so sunny and they all sound like they are having a ball. Closing track `Get Giddy' is paced and considered and almost feels a bit Americana, but it just rounds off what is a great debut. I really highly recommend, but listen to the samples, and hopefully you too will enjoy this band, who I hope to hear and see much more of.\n", "val": 0.01577710174024105}

Around track 4 or skipping around some you pop it out and put something new in. Grouplove, does not have this problem. You can play it cover to cover and love it more each time you listen to it. Definitely do not hesitate to pick this up.

{"text": "GROUPLOVE is a band out of L.A. that came together like something out of a movie. They just all found each other through friends of friends and made music in Greece. They even moved across the country to join one another and keep the band going. This EP is their hard work. I've seen them live and I have to say that they sound just as good as they do on the EP. It's a short EP but it's filled with dreamy Beach Boys inspired dancey pop. There are plenty of harmonies and catchy beats to keep you smiling. 'Colours', their get noticed single, is fun and is followed closely by 'Don't Say Oh Well' whose lyrics hint at the roots of the band. My least favorite track is 'Get Away Car'.

{"text": "Being a long time North Mississippi All-Star fan, I have been looking forward to hearing Keys To the Kingdom.  This being the first LP from Luther and Cody since the death of their father, Jim Dickinson, I knew this would be an emotional album with heart and soul... and it is.  In fact, Mr. Dickinson is listed as the album's producer... and it is a fitting tribute as it reflects much of his style.The album starts stomping with the groovin' beat oriented \"This A'Way\".  It is not a sizzling rocker, but more like a funky mid-tempo barrel house blues with a great guitar solo in the middle.  The next song, \"Jumpercable Blues\" has a more electric tone with the same great slide guitar work reminiscent of NMAS numbers of old.  A true highlight of the album has Mavis Staples helping out on \"The Meeting\", which has a great lead up to another swampy sounding and stomping blues number.  Having almost a gospel tinged feel, this song has Mavis trading lines with Luther and contains another great guitar solo.After starting the album with a rollicking sound, \"How I Wish My Train Would Come\" and \"Hear the Hills\" have a more laid back tone that lets you know how the guys are feeling after the loss of their dad.  The lyrics say it all, as they sing about trouble being their only friend and the cold rain falling down.  \"Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again\" could have been taken from one of Jim's old albums, and the old 'is it electric or acoustic' type of NMAS groove fits nicely with the honky tonk sound.  More of Luther's slide work is highlighted on \"Let It Roll\" before going back to a slower song full of more lyrical tributes to their dad, as \"Ain't No Grave\" reveals some more thoughtful lyrics about death and dying.  It is not a slow dirge by any means though.  It is more of a laid back song about how he hopes to \"be as brave as he was on judgment day\".  Ry Cooder's slide-guitar playing behind all the sentimental lyrics is also truly remarkable, and expresses as much as the singing does.After taking a break from the slower but grooving numbers, an acoustic stomp with more swampy blues is brought back again with Alvin Youngblood Hart helping out on `Ol Cannonball\".  The interplay between Cody's drumming and the acoustic instruments is nicely done with my only wish being that the song was longer.  It made me want more.  After holding it back some, the attitude returns again with a harder tinged \"New Orleans Walking Dead\".  Alvin Youngblood Hart joins in again and absolutely wails on the harmonica as the guys crash up and down and all around the beats.  This is a great song with a heavier tone.  \"Jellyrollin' All Over Heaven\" is a fitting way to end this album as it could have easily been written and played by their father. It is a bouncy and happy jam that will fit nicely in their live concerts for years to come.  They sing about the sisters shaking that heavenly thing.  I can see their dad smiling down on them as they play this song.  Fittingly, it fades away with solo piano playing in the distance.Overall, this album was just as I expected it to be... a great tribute to Jim Dickinson.  It is not the crazy electric jams found on Shake Hands with Shorty, or even the more recent Hernando.  This is a mid-tempo groove album that is steeped in emotion and you can feel it.  A great way to start the bluesier scene in 2011 and one that I will be listening to for a long time.  If you enjoy the North Mississippi All-Stars, this is an album you need to hear.

Now after buying Keys to the Kingdom I am back to thinking they just can't fully reach their potential.  Decent collection that at times sounds like a bunch of demos. I guess I just miss the visceral jolt of the electric boogie that they are so good at.  My other gripe is the vocals are a bit to front and center & that is just not their strong point.

{"text": "This latest release from the NMA is regarded as a rather personal expression from Luther and Cody as a tribute to their late father, the legendary Jim Dickinson. I respect and appreciate that for what it is, no question. Just disappointed that the music doesn't center too much around the musicianship in the band, particularly Luther's guitar wizardry. It's more song-oriented, as I guess you could call this a concept album, and the songs are overall way more laid back, more akin to old-time country and gospel than the raunchy, R.L. Burnside-esque blues the boys are known for. Well, the NMA don't cut it as a country band for me...they shine when doing blues only...just my opinion. A few tunes are more bluesy, but they're rather ordinary and not very exciting...the opening track is pretty good, however. I guess I was expecting that the resulting music of the boys' dealing with Jim's passing would be steeped in blues, but they decided to take a more \"heavenly\"-oriented approach, hence the more gospel-ish tinges. Well...I never considered these guys a gospel-type band. Sure, the two genres are musically related, but it sounds to me that they're a little out of their element. Luther isn't technically a great singer, and gospel music (and Memphis Soul, which heavily drew its sound from gospel music) has traditionally relied on a strong vocalist to get the message across. Hill Country Blues, on the other hand, to me seems to focus more on the feel of the vocal rather than technical ability. I've always thought Luther's vocal style was more suitable for the blues. On the first two albums, especially, Luther's singing is very good...his voice fits right into that kind of music.Listen to this album, then throw on 51 Phantom, their second album...now on which album does the band sound like it's really cookin', really locking in, gelling, and in their element? There's no contest, brother!So sure, a touching tribute to the late great Jim D., and I don't want to come off as downplaying that, but I am pretty disappointed with the musical approach of this effort. I guess my disappointment is more pronounced by the fact that the boys won't be coming anywhere near me on this winter's tour...I won't be able to see them tear it up in person, and this album doesn't really serve as a substitute for that...oh well, maybe next time...they're still young, I'm sure there's more good stuff to come, and they released a few great live download albums a couple of years back that I can keep listening to... :-)\n", "val": 0.000384657847462222}

While today's economics dictate synthesizers replacing the strings from the originals this a great set - recorded in Sweden. The new version of Cherchez  La Femme is also really good. Having seen Kid Creole twice- once on South Street in Philly where they were nothing short of incredible and once at Carnegie Hall where the acoustics were unfortunately terrible - its good have a new Kid Creole CD.

{"text": "Let me start out with positive news: the sonics and performances here are absolutely first rate. In the Copland, there's no unnecessary effort to keep the magnificent Ruffatti organ (Davies Hall) hemmed in - it roars like an old 727 on take-off. But that also begs the following question: why wasn't the same powerful organ permitted to sound a full fortissimo in MTT's recording of Mahler 8 (sorry, but a real sore point for me!)? But now for the rub.Henry Brant's orchestration doesn't, to my ears, sound much like Ives. Early on, there isn't any effort to pass the melodic ball over the woodwinds - the strings hog the show for far too long. When the woodwinds finally do get into the act, Brant makes them sound somewhat Stravinsky-like. There just isn't enough willingness to let the woodwinds have the simple tunes for themselves. Also, I can't remember Ives ever having employed harps to any degree. Did he? This doesn't sound bad, mind you, but it won't exactly make you think of the fourth symphony, or the \"Three Orchestral Sets\" either. The \"Concord Sonata\" has to be one of the Ives' stranger and more demanding works - both for the performer and the listener. Thus, so far, it's still best left as a piano sonata.The Copland is a quirky work, and was later reworked - sans organ - as symphony no. 1. I think the organ version works better, but I suppose that's also a matter of taste. As a work for organ and orchestra, it's not quite up there with the Saint-Saens 3rd, or the Poulenc organ concerto - that's not to mention the even noisier but still fun, organ and orchestra works by Jongen or Samuel Barber (I forget their titles but they're out there). Still, this could probably be considered top drawer among Copland's non-populist works, and this new recording of it is certainly a welcome addition to the work's discography.Overall, this disc can be considered interesting but non-essential listening. If you're truly curious about the Ives, try to hear it in its original solo piano form. Again, there's certainly no complaints about the sound quality and orchestral execution, not to mention the expertise that Tilson-Thomas lends to American music on any outing.\n", "val": 0.003733584890142083}

In those days there were the 3 Tenors and Three Mo Tenors and undoubtedly a few more combinations.  Today there are even more.  But these gentlemen from Australia are, in my opinion, the pick of the litter.The songs on this CD are from a certain era.  A goodly portion of the population will not be nostalgic to hear them - in many cases they will be brand new musical experiences.  However, I remember many of the original versions, and I enjoy hearing them sung by these finely blended voices and unapologetically lush musical arrangements.  The Tenors occasionally go for the humor, but in this collection they are pretty much serious the whole time.  (However, they are not shy about going for all the gusto in Besame Mucho and Granada.)  These are great songs, the harmonies are great, and occasionally the music raised the hair on the back of my arms, it's that good.I have heard Wonderful World a thousand times, but their version made me cry.Last night, during a difficult commute, this CD made me feel a whole lot better.I think the Ten Tenors are one of the great semi-undiscovered treasures in the world of music.  Tenors are typically thought to be temperamental, but these guys do not seem like divas at all.  They blend beautifully, they share the spotlight, and they look and sound like they are having a great time.

We hear out of this world sounds of gongs, Tibetan bells and various Didjeridoos, while going through various states of perception, such as Bliss, Gratitude, Wisdom...

{"text": "Paradiso and Rasamayi serve as musical spirit guides on their latest collaboration, 3rd Eye Rising: A Journey Through Ascending Realms.The CD features the talents of Paradiso on didjeridoo and keyboards and Rasamayi on chants and Tibetan and crystal singing bowls, resulting in a blissful sound experience that creates the impression of floating on clouds.Paradiso's keyboards lay the lush sonic foundation over which his didjeridoo and Rasamayi's chants and Tibetan and crystal singing bowls coalesce into exotic otherworldly sounds that rapture the senses and elevate the consciousness into other dimensions of being.There is one track, which I call \"The Gong Song,\" that completely grabbed my attention and never let go. Aside from a brief synthesizer intro, the recording is composed entirely of two gongs that sound like one gong coming to a shimmering conclusion over several minutes. I never thought I could be mesmerized by a tune consisting solely of gongs. It is probably the most compelling track on the album.3rd Eye Rising: A Journey Through Ascending Realms comes as close as an album can get to being the perfect aural background for meditation and massage. Its hypnotic, cathartic effect makes it absolutely conducive to therapeutic healing, and it's pleasant to listen to as an ethereal soundtrack to accompany the mind on its transcendental journeys.\n", "val": 0.030040036886930466}
{"text": "\"3rd Eye Rising\" is the first collaborative recording by Paradiso and Rasamayi. Subtitled \"A Journey Through Ascending Realms,\" the back cover states \"This unique CD accelerates your evolution by unlocking these spiritual gifts.\" Each of the eleven gifts is the title for its corresponding song. They are, Bliss, Gratitude, Invocation, Abundance, Transformation, Love, Guidance, Flow, Wisdom, Power, and Purpose. Instrumentation includes didjeridoo, Tibetan and crystal singing bowls, chanting, chimes, gongs, tampura, and Shamanic percussion.Paradiso is a producer, musician, master didjeridoo artist, and an internationally acclaimed sound healer. He also performs on keyboards on this album and has released four best-selling and award-winning CDs to date. Rasamayi is also an acclaimed sound healer whose elegant and soothing chants and crystal and Tibetan singing bowls create a fascinating contrast to the earthy and resonant didj. Each song was recorded with the intention of facilitating healing and transformation on all levels through the healing power of sound. The album is ideal for meditation, relaxation, massage, and all other healing modalities. The liner notes also state that the artists/healers are \"twin flames and partners in the mystic healing practice of the Sacred Sound Current. They are full body channels for many Guides, Angels, and Masters, who prescribe the frequencies for the development of those the couple serves in private practice, musical performances and group sound healings worldwide. Together, they represent the balance between divine masculine and feminine energies.\"I have to admit that this album is very different from the piano music I usually review, but the journey is a fascinating one. The sound quality is superb, allowing the listener to focus on any of the layers of sound as well as to the blending of the various musical voices as a whole. More ambient and atmospheric than melodic (with exceptions), I find that the music evokes many visual images for me that bring a rather hypnotic state.

{"text": "While SO many Bright Eyes fans want them to go back to the Fevers and Mirrors or Lifted days, I applaud Conor and the band for always trying new styles and not sticking to what the fans wants from them. When a new album is coming out, I never know what to expect from them because, especially in the recent years, they have broadened their musical style. Any band that can come out with both a Folk and an Electronic album in the same year is fearless, in my opinion, and Oberst is always fearless in his lyrics, self-searching, exploring his insights on spirituality and existence, and you have to realize, this guy's been writing since he was what, 12?! He is one of the great songwriters of our generation because he is honest, and he doesn't rely on what's popular, whether in collaboration with other artists or on his own. It's always a pleasure to delve into another Bright Eyes album and see what they come up with next. Like another reviewer stated, Conor's outlook seems more cheerful on this one and the music reflects this attitude. I look forward to hearing more.\n", "val": 0.033227112144231796}
{"text": "Either I'm too old and jaded, or this is a terrible album. Let me preface this by saying I have been a Bright Eyes fan for close to ten years now, and have seen Bright Eyes live and in concert twice. I'm probably a bit older than the average Bright Eyes fan, and often felt like an old man at the two shows I saw Bright Eyes/Conor Oberst at, once in Tempe, AZ, and once in San Francisco, but this new album just isn't doing it for me. I got into Bright Eyes by a chance encounter in 2002, when a friend burned a copy of Lifted for me. I listened to the album for weeks, couldn't extract it from my CD player in the car. After that, I went back and bought the older stuff, and fell in love with the various and beautiful music of Fevers & Mirrors, I'm Wide Awake, Digital Ash, and Noise Floor. But the album that really blew me away was Cassadaga. From the opening spiritual monologue to the final song, the album was tight, and had a clear message, namely, the world is a vast, beautiful, ugly, and mysterious place, and Bright Eyes had a mystical flashlight to shine a path through the darkness. I listened to Cassadaga for months, and subjected whoever was nearby to listen to it, as well! I purchased The People's Key on vinyl on the 15th, Conor's birthday, the day it was released. The only thing good I have to say is that, for $20 plus dollars, the record company was \"kind enough\" to place a CD in the gatefold vinyl album I bought. I've listened to this for a few days now, and either I'm too old and jaded, or this is a terrible album. Sadly, I think it may be the latter. It sounds like Conor and Mike Mogis are just going through the motions, just phoning it in. I miss the furnace blast of Cassadaga, the pomp and majesty of Lifted. When I listened to either of those albums, I felt like finally, here was a bright, gifted, intelligent young artist with something to say, an angry but loving young man who looked around and didn't like what he saw, didn't like what direction America was going in, but had the desire to change it, do something about it, and take us, the fans, along in the process. Sadly, that pomp, brilliance and majesty is missing on this album. This isn't a Bright Eyes album, it can't be... there is no fire, no heart, only songs tossed off without consideration of the fans, the true fans, the ones who have been along on the ride for some time now. I recently read an article in a recent Rolling Stone in which Conor was saying that he just couldn't relate to much of anything, or anyone, these days, that he felt disconnected. Unfortunately, this seems all too true. I have searched for meaning in The People's Key, but sadly, this sonic mess hasn't unlocked any doors for me. I want the old Bright Eyes back, the band with more soul, heart and fire than twenty nameless bands put together... Conor, reach into your soul, and try to find what the journey on the road has taught you. There are fans out there who love what you're doing, and, like me, realize that artists are people too, and are allowed the occasional misstep. I'm willing to set this album aside and wait for one more, another work of brilliance like Lifted, I'm Wide Awake, or Cassadaga. I believe the band has it in them to create more works of beauty... how could they not? Cassadaga was only four years ago! Yes, I believe they can find more poetry in the wicked beautiful mess that is America, but another misstep like The People's Key, and it may be time for this old man to get off the ride and head home.\n", "val": 8.831619197735563e-05}

Slowly each of these songs seeped into my subconscious and ran through my head literally non-stop. First it was Shell Games and Haile Selassie (because they were released earlier), followed by Triple Spiral, then Jejune Stars, then Beginner's Mind.. etc. Yes, the production is a little odd on a lot of the album, I wouldn't say its overproduced though. Just a little different flavor that honestly I'm glad for. Being such a Bright Eyes enthusiast I like that Conor has created so many different sounding albums. And Digital Ash is my favorite album (listen to it with good headphones, BRILLIANT production detail) so its nice to hear something closer to that again.

After listening to it more times, however, I began to appreciate the sound and the lyrics. It may not be as emotional as fevers and mirrors or Wide awake, but some of the tracks are very genius, and oberst manages to pack a huge amount of different inspirations into an album. Parts of \"Approximate Sunlight\" sound very Pink Floydy, Shell games is very enjoyable and catchy, and a little emotional.

A handful of decent songs clued me in that Conor Oberst had some kind of talent, but it was very difficult for me to get over the whiny, self-indulgent pity party he seemed to want to throw on every album. 16 year old girls find this to be very impressive, I understand. Males in their mid-thirties usually don't. In a word, Conor Oberst was OBNOXIOUS.  That's why this album comes as a huge surprise. Incredibly well constructed songs, inticing production, intriguing lyrics and concepts, an overall sense of well-being and hope as opposed to despair and self-pity, this album shows a depth I honestly thought Bright Eyes did not possess. This album is on my turntable constantly! Every song is a gem and, while the narrative ramblings of Randy Brewer might be confusing to some, I find them to fit rather well with the overall tone of the album.

Bright eyes is here to rip your heart out and make you cowher as if your facing some kind of noble king.  To pass by this idea the cd is truly a unique one compared to the rest of his repetoire.  It is less sensitive.  Without a doubt.  He seems to finally have found his place in this world and is not whining for his lover.He seems to have come to terms with life and facing the reality that he has a power in his words that make people think differently about those thoughts deep in the crevices of our brain.  He always has a very universal message.  Now, I can ramble about how great I consider bright eyes all day.

{"text": "First off, my title is a reference to a common chord progression.  In roman numeral notation, ii= minor chord from the second degree of the scale.  V= major chord from fifth degree.  I= tonic or the chord built off the root of the scale.  These chord progressions are generally some kind of variation of Dminor, G, C.  For example, the chorus of Shell Games \"Here it comes...\" is F, G, C.  This is a IV V I, which is a variation on the ii V I, replacing the ii chord with its relative major, IV.Now for the review of the album:In 2009 and 2010, I got into Bright Eyes and Conor Oberst.  I got a lot of his albums (Cassadaga, I'm Wide Awake it's Morning, Digital Ash, Lifted, and the two Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band albums.)  Suffice it to say I was excited for this one.I was definitely surprised at first.  It sounded much less folky and more indie rock.  I enjoyed it. I like Shell Games, despite the fact that he uses two of the most overused chord progressions in music.  My favorites are Ladder Song and a Machine Spiritual.  I thought that that was Oberst at his both musical and lyrical best.My criticism of this album is primarily the musical aspects of it. Specifically his use of the same chord progression (a ii-V-I) as mentioned above.  He uses it in Shell Games, where it works.  He also uses it again in Jejune Stars, but transposed to a different key.  I found that this made the album seem SO much slower and is actually one reason why it lost a star.Other than that, it's pretty good.\n", "val": 0.01300552487373352}

After the Lost finale, the structural strength of my cultural heart eroded, but this final album from Bright Eyes broke that heart.  The Peoples Key is a horrible goodbye.  It's a farewell similar to dropping off your fiance at the airport, and she says, from outside the passenger window, \"I don't love you.  I don't think I ever did.  See ya later.\"I subtitle The Peoples Key with \"to a cabinet in the basement you never need to open.\"  It's narrator warns you at the start that this is going to be a rambling, word-wasting mess.

{"text": "Conor Oberst once made the ambitious mis-step or releasing two Bright Eyes albums at once; he issued the classic \"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning\" and the cringe worthy electronica of \"Digital Ash in A Digital Urn\" on the same day. One was a beautiful, thoughtful descendant of Bob Dylan, the other was an amateurish Kraftwerk homage. \"The People's Key\" sounds like he learned from that moment and pulled the best of each onto one album. \"The People's Key\" uses a full band to highlight Oberst's gifts of melody, penchant for strange narratives/spirituality and his curiosity for electronic instruments and forges them into a dynamic album with many highlights.Like Iron and Wine's \"Kiss Each Other Clean\" (issues roughly the same time), \"The People's Key\" shows Oberst fleshing out the edges of his comfort zone with richer arrangements and fuller singing. Purists might not take to it easily, but there is a direct line from Oberst's time in Monster's Of Folk (who did a raucous concert performance), his more personal songs on the solo album and the opening narrative of \"Cassadaga.\" Also, like Dylan, there are moments of inexplicable lyrical oddities that are as filled with beauty as they are strange. Who else could rhyme the title of the song \"Haile Selassie\" with the line about his audio equipment (\"one drop and a bubbling Leslie, calling me home like Haile Selassie\").Oberst is a restless artist, as anyone who has followed his eclectic career can tell you. The wild mood swings on \"The People's Key\" are testament to that factor, yet it is strong enough an album to hold together. I'll probably always be wedded to the style of the man who wrote and sang \"I'm Wide Awake,\" but even the annoying \"shamanic vocals\" credited to one Denny Brewer (without which I might have given this 5 stars) can distract from the richness of \"The People's Key.\"\n", "val": 0.016893677413463593}

The sound is alot denser than before in places. (some would call this \"produced\" I guess, but It just sounds like more instrumentation to me)People seem to be dissing the lyrics also, which is sort of weird.  I think most of the people that are complaining just felt a real connection to lyrics from lifted or i'm wide awake and they're not liking the subject matter of this album as much.  There's still a lot here for lyrics, but overall it's less whining with more imagery.  I like the vocal delivery from the early stuff, but I think that singing Conor is more mature than warbling Conor.Overall, strong effort with some really good musical twists and turns. I dig the voice interludes quite a bit. I actually laughed a few times during the first listen of this (sort of how I laughed when I first heard the lyric \"I took all I could, it was free\" from classic cars off of cassadaga lol).. I realize that line wasn't really meant to be funny, but the way he said it must have caught me off guard.I was really surprised by some songs, Jejune stars took me for a bit of a loop first listen.

{"text": "I've been a fan of Bright Eyes since \"Wide Awake\" and \"Digital Ash\" and was really looking forward to this album, but after listening to it I find myself looking forward instead to the next Conor Oberst album.  What's the difference (other than the record label)?  Only time will tell, I suppose, but whereas \"Conor Oberst\" sounded like a guy playing with a band and with real instruments, \"The People's Key\" is a step backwards to the lo-fi sounds of a guy using Pro Tools in his home studio, layering and looping instruments and sound effects and sounding like he's singing in a well.  I liked it in \"Digital Ash\" but I guess now I want to hear more of Conor Oberst rather than Bright Eyes.  The lyrics also seem more obtuse, and combined with the sonics the record seems distant and opaque in contrast to the highly personal and warm \"Conor Oberst\".  So why did I give it four stars?  Because it is still a very good record by a talented musician who is always worth listening to, with inventive arrangements and lyrics and perhaps more hooks than any previous Bright Eyes record.  It's too good for three stars.  I can understand why some fans love this album and why some are disappointed.  If I wasn't comparing Bright Eyes to Conor Oberst, I might love it too.\n", "val": 0.0007143151015043259}

{"text": "'The People's Key' is everything Oberst probably wanted it to be - different from previous records, but similar enough to tie it all together in only the way Bright Eyes can. The record infuses inventive song structures with electronic rock flourishes and catchy choruses, and it works incredibly well. Like most Bright Eyes records, this takes more than 1 listen to appreciate. At times, Conor seems a bit emotionally distant, not helped by the filtering of his voice, but the lyrics are perfect.The biggest problem with this album is the incredibly irritating spoken word ramblings of the lead singer of Refried Ice Cream, some psychedelic fruitcake that Oberst met on the road. After editing all of these contributions out of the album, it becomes a 4 1/2 star album. Unfortunately, most listeners don't have this luxury and are stuck with it, but I far prefer listening to my Bright Eyes without suffering through the nearly 3 minute introduction of the same musings about the universe every time I want to hear some good music.That said, the music on this album is nearly technically flawless and there are some fantastic songs on this record.  I'll be listening to this one for a long time (without the creepy old man).\n", "val": 0.03912227228283882}
{"text": "The first time I saw a Bright Eyes show, it consisted of a lonely Conor Oberst sitting on the edge of a stage in San Diego accompanied by an acoustic guitar and about 12 listeners more interested in their coffee than the music. I was instantly compelled and my adoration for the songster has bloomed into a love for much of Oberst's extended musical family throughout the Saddle Creek folksy empire and offshoot Team Love Records, past established craftsmen like Ward, and ending somewhere around Oberst's idols themselves such as John Prine.Through this interest, I've come to know two things about Oberst:1) He's a restless guy. He's never happy where he is, who he is there with, or what they are doing there. So through his trademark prolificness, you get musical stylings that run the gamut of the genres from electronic to hard rock to punk to pop to folk to country; and successive songs and albums have nary a consistent contributor aside from the skeletal three: Oberst, Mogis, and Walcott. If you bought one or more previous records and are looking for the same sound in this one, you are expecting something unreasonable.2) He's a student of music. You can tell from his songs that he is very interested in what makes songs interesting and, particularly, what makes them catchy. What is is about any one song that makes your brain repeat the same four words over and over again in your head until you shake it and say \"stop!\" out loud in the middle of the supermarket? His music is an exploration of music itself more than anything, and his albums demonstrate that very clearly. This is why you have the spoken word sections of tracks mixed in with the songs themselves. This is not a collection of musical instruments with words over them. This is a journey that you are taking with its creators. You need to be in for the long haul, along for the ride. You have to open and ready to explore this particular section of music with the band. If you want something less, look elsewhere.Coming together with the above aspects of the album, Oberst finds, as always, unique themes and imagery to mix into each song and the arrangements are nothing short of haunting. The tracks are ordered perfectly to maintain pace and interest. It's a record that must be heard, and heard repeatedly, to be understood, but will be instantly loved. Buy it and experience it. It's wonderful.\n", "val": 0.01253439113497734}

I first fell in love with Bright Eyes when I heard their album \"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning.\"  The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.  I would not recommend this to anyone.\n", "val": 0.0022116475738584995}

He is more outward looking and comes across as wise yet jaded, as opposed to merely depressed and introspective. The album also benefits immensely from Oberst's work with the Mystic Valley Band. The People's Key takes everything great about Bright Eyes and builds on it brilliantly.Don't miss Jejune Stars, Haile Selassie, Beginner's Mind, and One for You One for Me--which is the song that Cassadaga's I Must Belong Somewhere should have been.\n", "val": 0.06070416048169136}

This album is a rich, balanced culmination of Conor's musical journeys, and there are audible hints indicating inspiration from Smashing Pumpkins and Weezer's \"Pinkerton,\" from 80's synthesizer energy to the late rock aesthetics.  This is a solid album, bridging the band's soul-searching double release in '05 and the spiritual journey of Cassadaga from '07 into this new message of enlightenment and universal truths.I don't intend for this to appear as psychobabble.

Long time fan... faves include Fevers, Lifted & Digital Ash... I hated most of the solo stuff except for a few chosen songs... so I've been very critical of Conor before.I played the Amazon samples and thought I'd try it, listened this once through and thought \"not bad, but nothing jumps out as classic\", and now after about 10 listens I can't stop listening.  Like Digital Ash it builds its own aura, and you have to keep listening to appreciate it.  There is no one \"hit\" song, it is an album of songs that all sound better heard together.But the bottomline is, if you love Bright Eyes get it if for no other reason than to listen to some fresh songs by a band you like.  It's different, yet the same, and it has its own feel to it.  I wouldn't want the same old stuff anyway, I heard that before.

{"text": "This record can be disappointing depending on how you look at it.This is the 7th and rumored to be final Bright Eyes album. If you look at it from that perspective, disappointment will most likely be your initial reaction because a folk record along the lines of Lifted.. or Wide Awake would be a more fitting farewell.Yet if you look at it as another Bright Eyes record it's actually impressive. Listening to it I get the vibe that this is everything Digital Ash was supposed to be. The record is rock influenced with the slight hints of electronic synths. It sounds full, layered and is much more consistent than Cassadaga. The spoken word segments through out the album can get kind of annoying, but the don't really deter from the music. Lyrically angry Conor is pretty much a thing of the past. The lyrics and overall tone of his voice is more positive.The packaging for this record is nice, not quite as nice as Cassadaga's, but nice nonetheless. The outer jacket is a gatefold with holographic details on both the outside and the inner side where the lyrics are printed. The record is heavy 180g and comes in a standard plastic sleeve, but the actual record inner sleeve is enclosed as well. Saddle Creek tossed in a copy of the cd instead of the traditional download code which makes the vinyl package a great value.Overall this is a great record. If your new to Bright Eyes though start with Fevers and Mirrors than work your way through Lifted.. and Wide Awake... and listen to a young Conor in his absolute prime and see why he's one of the best writers of our young generation.\n", "val": 0.023730067536234856}

{"text": "I have a confession to make: I've never played Final Fantasy.  Although I've owned virtually every console that the game has been featured on, including the Super Nintendo, and Playstation's one through three, I've yet to play a single minute of a single game.  I've never been one who was into RPG's to start with, plus I don't have the patience or attention span, I don't believe, to sit and pay attention and keep track of all the potions and spells and stuff like that.I was always more prone to liking fighting games or God of War type hack/slace games.  Basically give me a few weapons and let me tear up some monsters/demons/bad guys is my motto.So when I heard my man Mega Ran was going to be putting out an album based on Final Fantasy VII I was interested, but not entirely sold on it.  Mega Ran's already proven that he can unleash some creativity when it comes to his music, as shown by Forever Famicom, the collaboration between himself and producer K-Murdock which featured Mega Ran's raps over old school NES/SNES based beats.Now admittedly that wasn't my thing.  I bought it and supported the project -- because that's what you do with true innovative music: you support it, because the labels won't --  but I think the old school Nintendo beats just didn't do anything for me.  It was tight as hell how the production ended up, and Ran's lyricism is never in question, but it just wasn't for me.So I didn't know what to expect.  Would it feature more of the seriousness of his \"RANDOM\" disography, or more to the video game \"Mega Ran\" discography in which it's a bit more relaxed and fun?  Well, I have to say that I feel \"Black Materia\" creates a proper balance between the two.I do have to point out that this feels like an \"inside joke\" of sorts. More emphasis on the \"inside\" part rather than the \"joke\".  It's like when you're around people who all know a specific story and their details, so they laugh about certain things or they'll just make a veiled reference to it.  They all knowingly smile or laugh, and yet you sit there confused, but wanting to know about what seems to be an interesting story.This feels like that at times.  As I said I'm not famiilar with the Final Fantasy series, and I have to think that if I had played Final Fantasy VII I would get this so much more.  As it stands, I absolutely love it.  It's telling this story that, that I'm assuming is the FFVII story, in each track and I'm captivated the whole time.  And since I haven't played the game or know anything about it, perhaps that's why I feel this way.  Like the old radio shows in which they'd tell stories each week.  Each week a new entry in the saga, which would have people huddled around their radios each week just waiting to hear the next exciting chapter.That's how I felt while listening to Black Materia.  I'm wondering though whether it's better to go in blind like myself or be like seemingly 99.99% of the rest of the population who's actually played the series and knows the things that are being talked about.I have to give it to Random here.  He's obviously got immense love for the series and this game specifically, and it is abundantly clear as you listen.  Each track a separate chapter in this story from the viewpoint of the characters.  It's truly an amazing concept album that you don't see often enough.  These days everything is sort of cookie-cutter.  There's a formula that people adhere to.  I wonder how many people actually TRULY understand that.The artists today are striving to do the same thing that's been done.  No deviation, no wandering too far from the beaten path.  And then there are independent artists such as Mega Ran and Lost Perception that are pushing those boundaries.  That are hopping the fence that lines that beaten path, to journey off and see what's over there.  That's the very definition of the term \"independent\".Awesome album, and trust me when I say you have not lived until you have listened to Don Corneo's track.  It'll make you question, in the words of the Don himself, \"are you sure this game is rated for Teens?\".Standout tracks include \"Don of the Slums\", \"Tifa\" and \"Avalanche\" among many others.  Production is tight and well done, as are Mega Ran and the guest rappers.Buy with confidence!\n", "val": 0.0005570008652284741}
{"text": "These are some really strong words coming from me, a fan that has only really jumped deep into Random's work in the last week, but I don't regret or doubt a single thing that's going to be said in this review.Random is a an intelligent and talented human being first, and then an awesome hip-hop artist who just so happens to shine above the rest of the nerdcore subgenre. I know nerdcore and I know the bigger names like MC Frontalot, but those artists don't deliver what Ran is able to. He doesn't just rap about nerdy subjects, he makes it a point to be very targeted in rapping about gaming. His Mega Man albums are insanely hot, but this one really did it for me.Final Fantasy VII has a huge following, myself included, and listening to the beats and lyrics that flow through this album really hits me and makes me think back to when I was 10 years old and sitting in my bedroom at 3 AM trying to get out of Midgar or just laughing with my best friend as we run through the Golden Saucer. Not only is it very personal and easy to connect with, but it's incredibly accurate and meaningful if you listen to the lyrical content. He's done absolutely everything he was supposed to with this album, and that's a breath of fresh air when you consider flops like Advent Children and other FF7 sequal works.If you are a Final Fantasy fan and you're not into hip-hop, give this a chance. It's not that garbage rap music that you hear in the year 2011. This is some really creative and awesome stuff. If you are a hip-hop fan and you loved the game, you're simply not a real fan if you don't have this album. Buy this, I'm serious. In just a few days, I see that this album has been extremely successful and I hope that what people take from this is that Mega Ran is not just a great nerdcore artist or a guy who can rap about Final Fantasy, he's a really talented and creative hip-hop artist overall.\n", "val": 0.033292755484580994}
{"text": "At what time and at what place could an album like this exist?  Here.  Now.  That's it.Obviously the artists involved on this project experienced something more than just entertainment when they played Final Fantasy 7. They were most likely drawn in to a world too fantastic enough to be our own but grounded in enough reality to make it palatable, with characters too eccentric to actually be our friends but emotional enough that we understand, root, and fight for them.  For many, FF7 was a flawed RPG with typical anime inspired art and a calculated swelling score; but for a few of us, Final Fantasy 7 reached into our hearts and showed us the kind of person we wanted to be with a gaming experience that will never be rivaled.Black Materia exists for people like myself, and I assume like the artists Random and Lost Perception, who still get chills when they hear a few bars from the score of the game.  The album plays much like the game does, a kinetic nebulous narrative packed with enough emotion to make your inner 13-year old weep.  With Black Materia we get all of the story of Final Fantasy 7, explained through raps more competently than any synopsis could do justice.  Verse by verse Random can pack that visceral punch with every rhyme showing how he can connect himself with this universe and bring it to life for others.  Over the aforementioned swelling Uematsu score from the game, we get some of the most catchy and surprising beats to come out of anyone's MP3 player.I downloaded the free preview of the album the other day which came with several tracks... it blew me away.  If you are on the fence about purchasing this then I'd suggest to check out the previews and find out for yourself that this concept actually does work (Google it).

And for something a little harder, Assemblage 23's \"Compass\" is far superior. Personally, I don't care much for the 8-bit fad and the C64 worhsip.  Far better would be a 16-bit fad and Amiga worship. There is a far richer musical lexicon there anyway thanks to MOD music. :)\n", "val": 0.003041862742975354}
{"text": "When I first heard m.i.a.b were making a throw back tribute album of sorts, my initial emotion was distress. Anyone who knows this group has high expectations based on their back catalog, they have created some of the most memorable and intelligent electronic music I have ever listened to, with layers and layers. Their first 3 albums are actually a continuing story, a mystery, questioning the listener to everything they may think they know about what is going on in this world. So I was worried when I heard they were breaking that mold. Well rest assured they have created a excellent album and quite possibly even built an entirely new sound I've never heard from them before. R.E.T.R.O explodes with it's epic openner, The Last Ninja III, and it really never lets you go until the subtle and calmingly slow closer, Whatever Mattered.. Experiencing the album is something you need to do with a good set of headphones, as like any of their other albums. The production and attention to detail here is astounding. One thing worth mentioning and it shows is, they have brought back old audio systems from the past and integrated them with todays technology. Never in my life have I heard music like this.. It's perfectly blended nostalgia, making you think back to the comadore 64 days, the cloak and dagger days, sweeping synths and keyboards making you feel like you are actually going back into the past.. Now, take that and infuse what they've been doing the past decade and you have a completely new sound that is commanding and epic, yet somehow melencholy and heart wrenching. A lot of the tracks here are completely instrumental, and they've turned out to be my favorite tracks. I highly recommend this album to anyone looking for more, and if you like this please do yourself a favor and find the rest of their albums.I've spent the majority of this review praising it, but there are a few blemishes; such as the length, I really wish it were longer, and I am it does seem that r.e.t.r.o is a bit self indulgent isolating any new fans of the group. It's a stretch trying to find something negative to say about m.i.a.b because they are so masterful with what they do.Stand out Tracks:The Last Ninja IIILightforceSupremecyThe Last NinjaI love 64Whatever Mattered\n", "val": 0.017838574945926666}

I have listened to every one of their CDs and own a majority and R.E.T.R.O is definately worth buying. Unlike other techno artists that barely scratch the surface in terms of quality, Mind in a Box sets the standard that, sadly, very few ever meet.Some of my favorite tracks on R.E.T.R.O include the soulful \"Whatever Mattered\", which employs one of Mind in the Box's best vocal performances, in my opinion, and \"8 Bits\", which throws you back behind that old NES controler with its amazing electronic chorus.Mind in a Box isn't your average, sub-par, one or two track artist. Everything they release is quality and certainly deserves more appreciation than it gets.Enjoy R.E.T.R.O!\n", "val": 0.02764471434056759}

{"text": "Music Choice on Comcast Cable frequently features the music of Beegie Adair and for good reason; Beegie's music is a fan favorite.  Not only does Beegie play the piano well, but she also directs and arranges the various ensembles that are featured on this double album.Every song on both CDs pleases me.  Typically, we play a CD during dinner; it is a wonderful accopaniement to fine dining.  Soft jazz might describe well Beegie's style; never jarring, never lacking harmony, always filled with famous and beautiful melodies such as Stardust, Strangers in the Night, and Unforgettable to name just a few on the first CD.  The second CD is a bit more upbeat with more players such as David Davidson working with Beegie and complementing her nicely.I can't recommend this double CD more highly to anyone who wants to relax and enjoy beautiful music well played and tastefully arranged.  Five Stars for Beegie.\n", "val": 0.026845330372452736}

{"text": "I am in no way a religious person, but:  GOD BLESS MIKE WATT.Forget that this is Watt's first (solo) album in over six years (yet he's performed on probably 6 or more other projects since, including AI's Kelly Clarkson's 3rd album and the 1st STOOGES' album in over 20 years!); forget that this is his THIRD (punk rock) OPERA; forget even Watt founded the MINUTEMEN and fIREHOSE...know only THIS:  that on Hyphenated-Man, Mike Watt & the Missingmen pound out 30 original, no-frills power trio blasts of post-punk skate-jazz filtered through dirty speakers and joyfully sung with a Yogi Berra-like ease.  Watt's THUD STAFF is as heavy, deft and poignant as ever. The production by Tony Maimone (Pere Ubu) pours from the speakers warm and big; this band sounds like they are playing in your lap.  The music is everything a fan of the Minutemen/fIREHOSE/Stooges/Mike Watt/Banyan/Unknown Instructors/Funanori might want:  intense jazz/folk/punk that is both simple and profound, played with mad musicianship and insight.  Watt's voice has grown husky from growling out his SPIEL (arty/political truisms) these passed 30 years: though nary is a rant in site:  he means every word.  Mike Watt opines heartfelt punk poetry (this time about being middle-aged) that somehow could have been uttered by you or me (or your dad...but this f'n rocks!).  And what about these Missingmen? Raul Morales plies his drums like a man possessed of virtuosity, power and finesse.  His rhythms are both loose & tight, with more than a passing nod to the never-overly-busy clockwork drumming of Minutemen George Hurley.  Then we have shamefully unknown guitarist Tom Watson who skates and scrapes his guitar strings into arpeggiated bursts of Frippian skronk one minute then jangling angular REM-ish chord pop the next right before reeling into blazing atmospherics that paint the spaces left by Misters Watt & Morales.  Though these musos tear through 30 songs on Hyphenated-Man, the whole album works as a suite, an opera per Watt.  The sum affect is akin to 30 movements or passages that create a whole rock-n-roll painting.  Taken in this context, the listener can hear Mike Watt's concept of each song playing a character from Heironymous Bosch paintings, filling up the canvas of his sonic landscape with \"belly-stabbed-man\" or \"arrow-pierced-egg-man\".  This album is all too human with all the hyphenated-men, yet the 47 minute CD flew by...didn't I just hit play?  So I hit play again, and then again.  Hyphenated-Man succeeds joyously on the kind of spastic punk/funk/folk ferocity that Watt/Hurley/Boon invented with the Minutemen.  This stuff is pure id from the guts of a bass troubadour who only wants to play his bass, spiel a little, and perform that DIY music just like we like it.  Mike Watt & the Missingmen are on tour through April 2011:  do yourself a big, rock-n-roll favor, GO SEE/HEAR them!  And per the on-going admonition of Mr. Watt himself:  go start your own band (I did)!\n", "val": 0.0040535954758524895}
{"text": "Mike Watt's last album, as much as I respected where it was coming from, was more of an exercise to listen to than a pleasure.  Long songs, bursting with narratives about catheters and perineal abcesses, as cathartic as they were, must truly be the most out-there concept of all time for a rock album.  After the high-water mark of \"Contemplating The Engine Room,\" which paired topnotch sidemen with concise, well written songs, the follow-up \"The Secondman's Middle Stand,\" was a bit of a choreful slog by comparison -- and I mean no disrespect.  The playing and recording are impassioned and inspired.  It was just the first Watt album -- even the first Watt project, ever, that didn't really move me.  I can engage it on a conceptual level, and I can be glad that Watt triumphed over his illness, while still not finding true satisfaction in the music.So I approached \"Hyphenated-Man\" with an unfamiliar trepidation.  As a Minutemen/Dos/fIREHOSE/Banyan/Bootstrappers/Unknown Instructors/etc. fan, this was a wholly disconcerting and alien feeling to have.  Watt's predilection for unusual themes and parameters was well promoted:  once again, this would be an \"opera,\" an album based on the odd humanoid characters that populate Hieronymous Bosch's 16th-century painting \"The Garden Of Earthly Delights.\"  In a long-awaited return to the short, chorus-less jazz/punk format of the Minutemen, this would also be an album of short songs.  Yet, all united in concept, conceived as one big song shattered into 30 pieces.  Watt wrote most of the songs on guitar, then reverse-engineered the bass lines.  Basically, he wrote himself a thought problem, then solved it 30 different ways.Well, I needn't have been concerned.  The results, literally dumbfounding on first listen, become addictive with repeated spins.  Crashing melodies and wiry musical micro-structures provided by Watt and tour-seasoned sidemen Tom Watson (guitar) and Raul Morales (drums) do indeed recall a certain band of yore, or even Watt's beloved Blue Oyster Cult -- albeit folded inward on themselves accordion-like so that only 2 of the 30 songs break (barely) the 2-minute mark.Despite the brevity, there are lots of hooks to grab onto.  Watt's voice has seasoned into a baritone yowl, and he bellows songs that are in some undiscovered musical landscape between punk, funk, and sea chanties(!).  It's nothing if not thrilling.  There are a few respites, but basically this album is a full-speed jazz-funk freakout.It's also the first release from Watt's own Clenchedwrench label, which will soon be releasing such delicacies as the fourth Dos album and the album he recorded in Italy in 2009 under the name \"Il Sogno Del Marinaio.\"  Hyphenated-Man is an auspicious way to kick things off, an oddball delight of a post-punk album just as spiky  and salacious as Bosch's bizarre menagerie.  Well worth the wait, and easily Watt's best solo release to date.\n", "val": 6.672173913102597e-05}

{"text": "Let me start off saying that this album is not bad but I was expecting better. We were lead to believe that this album was going to be more heavier than the previous albums which was not the case. There were too many ballads for my liking, a lot of soft songs that I could have done without. Another thing that bothers me is it seems like Red lacked creativity on here. What I mean by creativity is for example on their first album Enf of Silence they had epic songs like Lost and Let Go that sounded amazing. The bridge and final choruses ended very powerful and emotional. Instrumentally they used the strings and vocal parts perfectly with the screaming and heigten strings. It seemed that type of sound was missing from this album. It was almost like they were in a rush to complete the songs without putting extra effort to make the songs sound even better. One of the heavier songs on the album \"The Outside\" pretty much sounded filler. It lacked a good chorus and seemed like it was thrown in just to fill the record. I could have done without the song \"The Bst is yet to come.\" It sounded like a typical pop rock song that you've heard in the past. The best songs on the album by far are Feed The Machine, Watch You Crawl, and Buried Beneath. I was hoping more songs on the album would sound like those especially buried beneath. That reminded me of the old Red. Even though the songs were ballads and soft I can't say they were bad songs because they aren't. Let It Burn is a solid song, but when you have a good half of the album being on the soft side it gets repetitive. I miss the songs that had the style of Break Me Down, Lost, Let Go, Forever, etc. I was also dissapointed there were no bonus songs except a itunes bonus track. I was excited to hear it so last night I went on Itunes to check out a 90 second sample. To my dismay I was surprised the song is only 2:35 in length... why so short? I began to listen to it and I was shocked to hear the lack of lyrics in the song. I admit I haven't heard the full songs but 90 seconds out of 2:35 with no lyrics? come on now. It sounded pretty awesome but that was another let down to have just an instrumental track that was short in time. Overall this album is just OK. Im a big Red fan but whenever I think negative of an album no matter who its by I will state my opinion. I know some people will think anything their favorite artist puts out is automatically \"amazing\" but im not like that. If you don't like my opinion get over it, i'm not here to please you.\n", "val": 3.257092976127751e-05}

{"text": "Where to begin? What to say? Red, have you heard of them? If so, what do you know of them? Red began their musical career in the early 2000's, writing a few demos here and there. After being paired up with produced Rob Graves, Red set their career off with the release of End of Silence. At that very instant, Red was destined to capture the hearts of many. Heavy riffs, tender acoustics, heartfelt strings, relatable lyrics, powerful vocals, it had it all. And it didn't stop there; the critics themselves made it a point to say that Red wasn't just another rock-radio act. What followed was just success piled one upon another. Grammy nominated, selling records in the thousands, a chance to tour with famous acts like Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, Seether etc, Red got it all. This could have led to the fear that Red would convert to the generic radio act, with the goal of selling millions of records, but with the release of Innocence and Instinct, Red banished all doubts. Two years later, what does Red have to say for themselves....Let's just say that this is the perfect album for the fans. This album has more-or-less retained the same sound. Mike never lets down, as his vocals take you on an emotional journey, beginning in songs like Feed The Machine which features powerful vocals, and strong screams, or in ballads like Best is Yet to Come, where he tears at your heartstrings. The guitar work is good as always, while pulling off interesting riffs in song like Feed The Machine, and Faceless. The bass maintains a steady beat, and while being powerful, its never overbearing, as shown in Best is Yet to Come, and Watch You Crawl. The drums have greatly improved, and the drummer certainly doesn't want to fade in the background, as shown in songs Buried Beneath and Watch You Crawl. The strings are there as always, and prove themselves to be at their peak. This album even features synthesized beats, which play a strong part in the power ballad Let it Burn, one of the few songs featuring female vocalist Kerrie Roberts. The lyrics, poetic as always, carry a positive feeling, promoting themes such as forgiveness, to always look forward, and most of all, to find your identity.The album shows Red at its hardest, and yet remains subtle in some cases. Songs like Feed The Machine, and The Outside have their counterparts in the form of Not Alone, and Hymn For The Missing. But at the end of the day, this album isn't perfect. Fillers like The Outside and Who We Are show that Red must have slacked off at one point. Red have retained the same formula, and I, like many, will still love it. But for others, it might be the album to inspire hatred. Red continues to do what they do best, and that is to send out strong powerful albums, with excellent and positive themes and I have no doubt that Red will finally strike their fortune.Recommended:Feed The MachineFacelessLet it BurnWatch You CrawlBest is Yet to Come\n", "val": 0.021087922155857086}

I think Until We Have Faces is Red's best album to date. I like the direction they are going in. I've liked Red since the beginning, and after each album they get better. I've had this album on repeat since I've gotten it, it's that good. I think this album will make it into my top favorite 40 albums of 2011. I couldn't wait for this album to come out, it's been two years since their last album came out, and it's hard to wait that long for a new album. Red has sure stepped it up on Until We Have Faces. I think the iTunes bonus song Until We Have Faces should have been on the release, and not as a bonus song, because it's the name of the album, doesn't that make any sense? To me it does. Until We Have Faces is one of my favorite albums of the year. My favorite songs on this album are:1. Burned Beneath2. Not Alone3. Best is Yet to Come4. Faceless5.

From the pummeling riffs of \"Feed The Machine\" to the beautiful melancholy of \"Hymn For The Missing,\" there is never a dull moment on this record,\"Faceless\" has a great head bobbing riff right out of the gate with an epic chorus that closely rivals \"Breathe Into Me.\" Vocally, it's probably the best performance on the album. Meanwhile, \"Lie To Me (Denial)\" and \"Watch You Crawl\" lead off with equally enticing heavy riffs that pack a lot of punch.\"Let It Burn\" is a great hard rock ballad that makes the hairs stand, mixing emotive strings with a cascading wall of guitars and yearning vocals. Another softer gem, \"Not Alone,\" effectively embraces simplicity in a manner that should help it stand the test of time very well.And if you don't want to take my word for how good this album is, legendary Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci named \"Until We Have Faces\" his favorite album in 2011.

{"text": "Red's rise is pretty remarkable for a christian modern rock band, and their third outing should not disappoint the majority of fans. Though a lot more straightforward than both the previous two albums, Until We Have Faces gives fans the crunchy, flavorful alt rock that they expect out of Red, with even higher volume that before. There are a couple more ballads than before, and that can either be a positive or a negative depending of what kind of fan you are. Red still executes the album with good vocals and a high level of energy though, and that alone keeps the album from falling on its face. Boasting a generally hard sound (though not enough to be classified as hard rock or alt metal), Until We Have faces is an exciting listen.I think this album vies for \"top album\" honors with End Of Silence. If you liked Pieces off of that record, this release is a good one. If not, its still a quality addition to Red's resume.Tracks to check out:Faceless- An epic single, which will surely get many people air guitaring like crazyNot Alone- One of the few softer tracks.

I love every single song here and have no need to skip any song.1. Feed The Machine- This song is clearly the most intense of the album. It is the closest Red has come to sounding as much a metal song as Demon Hunter. It is well written, well produced, and the message is clear to whoever listens to it. 5/5 stars2. Faceless- This song is in the same vein as Wasting Time from their previous album \"End of Silence\". While the album doesn't have an official title track, Faceless could be considered the title track. This song is well produced, written, and the message is a good one like the first song. 5/5 stars3. Lie To Me (Denial)- This song is another authentic Red track and as such is as good as the previous two songs. Top notch song writing, production, and message. 5/5 stars4. Let It Burn- Is similar in quality to all three previous tracks. The intensity is similar to Lie To Me and many of their previous song from past records.5. Buried Beneath- While it isn't similar in sound it is similar in terms of intensity as the last two. Again top notch in every category.6. Not Alone- This song stands out as being one of the best songs in this record. It seems to be written to reach out to the listeners who feel the sense of loneliness and depression. It is the musical equivalent of Lost in almost every way. The song carries a genuine message that Red truly loves us their fans no matter what situation we are in.7. Watch You Crawl - This song is similar to Shadows from their album Innocence and Instinct. Every aspect was great and a genuine Red track. 5/5 stars8. The Outside- This song has the same intensity level as Breathe Into Me found in their album End of Silence. It is genuinely Red and as such is another great track. 5/5 stars9. Who We Are- This song is similar to Confession (Whats inside My Head) in terms of intensity from the Innocence and Instinct album. It is another genuine Red song so as to be expected, its a great song. 5/5 stars10. Best Is Yet To Come- This song is softer than most of the rest of the album. It is similar to Already Over and Not Alone in terms of intensity. It is another one of the albums best song because of its sound and message. 5/5 stars11. Hymn For The Missing- This song is the Until We Have Faces equivalent of Pieces. It is a really soft, sad, and beautiful song. All these emotions are blended together perfectly which closes out the record on a soft note. 5/5 starsUntil We Have Faces brings everything that fans of Red come to expect and they show us how experienced they truly are. The song writing is incredibly strong in every track, the production quality is some of the best in the industry, and I couldn't find any flaws in the entire album. Red fans should have no reason to worry when buying this album.\n", "val": 0.01509721577167511}

{"text": "Red has given us a great album...period. Here's a brief overview of their sound if that's all you read:Hard rockin' guitars,melodic chorus',Beautiful strings and some screaming usually heard during the bridge. Now,on to the review! Red starts things off with the incredible and aggressive \"Feed The Machine\" which is arguably the best track on the album. Heavy guitars and a dark ambiance drive home the songs lyrics about fighting conforming to what the world wants. Next up is the fantastic \"Faceless\".This song features the best lyrics on the album(I'm not,I'm not myself/feels like I'm someone else/Hollow and faceless/a part of me is dead/need you to live again/can you replace this/hollow and faceless)all while being chugged along with great guitar and string work. Another great song is \"Buried Beneath\".The song is hard,but sounds like its something you've already heard. Until the bells start chiming. The guitars and the bells in wonderful harmony make this track stand out.Things slow down a bit for the uplifting ballad,\"Not Alone\",that shows off lead singer Mike Barnes' vocal capabilities as he sings of God's constant presence and love for us as we walk in this cold world. Now things start to heat up again for the next few songs.\"Watch You Crawl\",\"The Outside\" and \"Who We Are\" are three strong tracks in a row.\"Watch You Crawl\" is about overcoming the struggles of sin and how good it feels to stand and watch it crawl.\"The Outside\" continues the basic theme about the struggle with sin with the lyrics(Standing on the outside/I'm looking in on what you can't hide/dying on the inside/but now I can see your lies from the outside)the awesome bridge break-down is also notable.\"Who We Are\" is a fist-pumping anthem that reminds us that we are free from sin and death and that we are alive! And the track that finishes the album off is \"Hymn For The Missing\".Hymn... is a beautiful and emotional ending to this outstanding album with its careful strings and passionate vocals. To sum the whole thing up...BUY IT NOW!!But seriously,this is a fantastic album. Heavy and melodic with strong lyrics and vocals. If your looking for comparisons,think Breaking Benjamin,Linkin Park and Skillet. See ya and God bless!\n", "val": 0.022958939895033836}

However this album seems to strike a good thoughtful balance as I could hear the lyrics fairly clear, and there were several moments where the music appropriately goes into a quieter part.  I can decipher the actual words, and I like that.For those who are going through, or have gone through hard times in their lives from relationships will like the reflective attitude taken in the lyrics and instruments.Lie to Me, and Let it Burn seem to be my favorites, but there are only 1 or 2 songs I find myself skipping.

{"text": "This album is absolutely amazing.  The music is balanced perfectly with the majority of it being hard rock, while the other part is the slower, more meaningful, lyrically focused material that is very common of Red.Let me start off by saying that while this album is ridiculously good, it is not quite as good as their first release \"End of Silence.\"  However, it is a huge improvement from their sophomore album \"Innocence and Instinct.\"I'll review this album song by song...1.  Feed the Machine - This is a great song to open the album.  It's probably one of their heaviest songs (if not the heaviest) that they have ever made.  The drums are very deep and the guitars have a great hard rock sound to them.  The lead singer Michael Barnes' voice is extremely powerful with lots of growling and screaming.  The only thing that I don't like about this song is the ending.  It goes into a very long period of calm strings, which Red is known for, but for me it's just wasting time.2.  Faceless - For me, this song is something that I could see any person liking.  It's got the perfect balance between the heavy guitars and the calmer chorus, which by the way is extremely catchy.  The lyrics are all about the name of the album.  It deals with the struggles of finding one's identity.  It's a very passionate song that I think is one of the three best songs on the album.3.  Lie to Me (Denial) - I'm going to get straight to the point... Best song on the album and probably my favorite song by Red of all time.  It's similar to songs like \"Breathe into Me\" and \"Already Over.\"  The guitars are extremely heavy.  They sound like something you would hear on an album by August Burns Red.  The singing once again is very passionate.  I'm sure that you will be singing this one wherever you go after you hear it a few times.  This is a downright amazing song.4.  Let it Burn - This song is just alright to me.  It's one of their lighter songs that doesn't really pop out to me lyrically or musically.  However, the chorus is extremely catchy.5.  Buried Beneath - This is a very epic song that I could hear in an action movie trailer or something.  I know this will kind of sound crazy, but during the chorus when Michael says \"Reach down and pull me out, pull me out, before I am buried beneath\" I can just picture him hanging onto a cliff about to fall down or something.  This is one of my favorites on the cd.6.  Not Alone - Red seems to release one or two songs similar to this on every album.  It's very similar to \"Pieces\" from \"End of Silence.\"  It's very slow and calm.  If you only like the harder stuff from Red, then this is not for you.  I must say though, it's a very moving song.  If you listen to the lyrics, it's so uplifting and positive.  The chorus makes me want to cry... \"I am with you.  I will carry you through it all.  I won't leave you, I will catch you, when you feel like letting go.  'Cause you're not...you're not alone.\"7.  Watch You Crawl - If somebody came up to me and asked me what Red sounded like I would probably play this song for them.  Everything about it is classic Red.  It's got the heavy guitars, rockin' drums, and passionate singing.  Very Red.8.  The Outside - I really like this song and based on the other reviews I have read, everybody else does too.  It's a very \"fun\" song.  The chorus is almost guarunteed to stay in your head.  It's heavy, it's epic, it's everything that a rock fan would love to hear.9.  Who We Are - This is one of Red's more popish sounding songs.  Please don't take that the wrong way though...it's still heavy and Red sounding.  In heaviness I would put this song between \"Let it Burn\" and \"Lie to Me (Denial).\"  Just like \"The Outside\", the chorus is really catchy and I have a feeling you'll have a hard time keeping it out of your head.10.  Best Is Yet to Come - I'll be honest, this to me is the weakest song on the album.  It's very slow and calm and honestly I just skip it every time I get to it.  It's just a little faster than \"Not Alone\", but it's not nearly as catchy, lyrically meaningful, or captivating.  Quite honestly, this is just a boring song for me.11.  Hymn for the Missing - This is a beautiful song.  It reminds me a lot of \"Take it All Away\", from \"Innocence and Instinct\" and \"Already Over, Part 2\" from \"End of Silence.\"  The lyrics have the same sort of reassuring feeling in that of \"Not Alone\", but it's a lot slower.  Honestly, I skip it a lot, but when I'm in the mood to listen to it, it's very emotional and captivating.  Red seems to end every album with songs like this and I think that all three of their albums' ending songs are fantastic, including this one.\n", "val": 0.018743174150586128}

When the song screams to you to wake up, it does it with such authority so you could have it as a alarm clock on your iPod.\"Faceless\": The song questions our identity, are we truly ourselves? or are we living as someone else? it's for someone who is trying to find a face in the world we live in. The lyrics are so emotional to me, it gets me out of problems I suffer from.Each song is a emotional roller coaster ride to me, From finding hope in \"A world so cold\"(Not Alone) to seeing the lies of our sins and lives(The Outside) to finally remembering a lost loved one in our hearts or being haunted by our sinful past and wondering if someone is looking over us(Hymn For The Missing). Indeed the band has been driven to make this a very powerful album and has the music to prove it.

{"text": "Innocence & Instinct was one of the best hard rock albums to be released in recent memory. That being said, the fact that Until We Have Faces doesn't quite match it isn't too much of a criticism. This album still grapples with deep themes and a mix between in-your-face rage and heartfelt emotion. UWHF doesn't pull off that balance as beautifully as Innocence & Instinct did. Instead, it features a blazing, intense first half that is undoubtedly the better half, followed by a softer second half that, while sincere and often good, does not even brush the beauty or emotion of Innocence & Instinct's conflicted ballads. Indeed, this album stands in the shadow of Red's masterpiece sophomore effort. When standing alone, however, it is still one of the better rock efforts to be seen in the past year, and definitely beats a simple rehash of the previous album (as many bands seem to be in the business of doing these days). I see more Breaking Benjamin here than I've seen from them before, but that is not entirely a bad thing. My hope is that this album is a mere stepping stone in their journey toward another masterpiece to match or surpass Innocence & Instinct. Indeed, it is a strong and enjoyable stepping stone, with multiple standout tracks (and decent fillers) that will keep your speakers blaring until the next album comes together.

The band does occasionally scream, so if you are into that this would appeal to you. For people who want heavier rock music with a decent moral message this is the album for you.'Faceless' is the best heavier song in my opinion.

{"text": "It seems like just yesterday I first saw an upstart and eager band take the stage, opening for Sevendust, in support of their debut record, End Of Silence. Yet here we are, greeted with the band's THIRD album, Until We Have Faces. Red has been a band that has gotten progressively better with each CD, both lyrically and musically, so I was quite excited to hear their newest offering.My verdict? It's Red's best yet. They've successfully married the raw, in your face, aspect of End Of Silence and the more polished, mature, sound of Innocence & Instinct to give us a mature, hard rocking record.Any fan of Red will feel right at home from the get-go thanks to the uber-powerful opener, Feed The Machine. From then on it's business as usual for the band. Until We Have Faces is unbelievably good, but it's not anything Red hasn't done before. Every song is easily listenable, each with it's own distinct sound and message, it's just got that Red stamp on it. Which isn't a bad thing. These guys are still around for a reason, they're good at what they do...churning out catchy, relatable songs with anthemic choruses, driving riffs and great vocals. Before you think I'm pegging this as 'more of the same,' I'm not. Until We Have Faces is its own distinctive entity, one that progresses Red's catalog nicely. What mainstream rock band do you know that injects strings into each and every track without it ever sounding tacky or just plain out of place? I can't think of any. Hence, the 'Red stamp' I was referencing earlier.Like I said, every song is good. Sure, it's easy to pick out favorites, but as a whole, Until We Have Faces has an excellent flow where no song sounds out of place. Jump starting the CD, as I already stated, is the incredibly heavy opener, Feed The Machine. From there we have Faceless and Lie To Me (Denial), both of which are begging to be released as singles (though I think Lie To Me already is?). Both offer strong riffs, powerful vocals and lyrics that are, as usual, very well written. Buried Beneath is a chorus driven track that will have you rocking your head and singing along almost instantly. It wouldn't be Red if there wasn't a poignant ballad, which is just what Not Alone is. Normally I might say this throws off the balance, but in this case it keeps your attention. Great song with great lyrics. The other song that immediately jumped out at me, personally, was Best Is Yet To Come. We've all felt exactly what the lyrics say at one point, and they couldn't have written them better. Coupled with passionate vocal delivery and music that only adds to the final product, I'd say this, along with Feed The Machine, are the two must hears.All in all, Until We Have Faces is a great rock record. One any fan of rock music will find interesting at the very least. Likewise, if you've ever shown any interest in the band, this would be the CD to get. Red is a band that plays with passion and intensity, and you can really tell when you listen to this CD. Highly Recommended.\n", "val": 0.02150467038154602}
{"text": "I purchased at release and had high expectations after the promise shown in Red's previous album.However, as I listen to the cd, I cannot help from constantly identifying most of their sound with other mainstream artists.  In this way, they are rather unoriginal.  Most of their songs have taken a glaring shift toward a whiny modern rock sound I associate closely with Breaking Benjamin.  The end result, for me, is a frequently dull listening experience with unimpressive vocals.\"The Outside\" is the best track on the disc. It is also the best executed and most interesting piece of songwriting.  It strays from the widespread Breaking Benjamin sound to something more like Chevelle or Tool.  For me, this is a good thing.Perhaps their most distinctive feature is the involvement of background strings.  But with the exception of a few cases, this ends up being pretty forgettable.Spiritually, the content of the songs doesn't feature much depth.  Perhaps the most profound idea is the allusive title to C.S. Lewis' work.  The simple, although ambiguously presented idea of looking forward to heaven in \"Best Is Yet To Come\" is the most moving part of the album.  Nonetheless, this CD does present a good option for those wanting a similar sound to popular mainstream hard rock without the unnecessarily sordid lyrical content.I'd say it's worth the $6 I bought it for.  A few of the tracks will make my lifting playlist.  But overall I had higher hopes for better, more original songwriting.\n", "val": 0.006260794587433338}

The production is 100x better than I thought it was, with subtle strings and chorus. I loved the CD in its purest form. These songs are amazing, though they did take a listen or two to grow on me.

{"text": "There is a huge challenge to a band that produces a landmark album: where do you go from there?  This is the situation that Red finds themselves in since End of Silence, which was an instant classic.  Innocence and Instinct was a very good follow-up but clearly a step down.  Now we have Until We Have Faces.  I've listened to this album about 10 times now and I can say that I think this is another full step down from Innocence and Instinct.  That doesn't make it a bad album by any means - I certainly enjoy listening to it and I do recommend it and give it four stars, but if you are looking for somewhere to start with Red, start with End of Silence.  Honestly, I don't think there is a single track on End of Silence that I would drop for even the best tracks on Faces (Lie to Me and Faceless).The first half of the album is good stuff and very much in the mold of what we've come to expect from Red.  It's more of the standard hooks, strings, screams, and power chords that define their sound.  Lie to Me is the most innovative song in this, and I really like the direction they went here.  The lyrics are pretty good, but the vocals are a little covered over by the instrumentation and the liner notes are surprisingly difficult to read printed in red on red.The second half of the album was surprising with a couple of big ballads - specifically Not Alone, Best is Yet to Come, and Hymn.  These really highlight one of Red's most underrated qualities - Mike is actually a genuinely excellent singer and not just a screamer, and he is in top form.  Watch You Crawl and The Outside both have kind of a dance riff which is also a different sound for them.  All of this makes the second half of the album very different from what we've heard from Red in previous efforts.  The songs are well done, but I regularly find myself tuning out of them.So all of that to say this:  if you really liked Silence and Innocence, you're very likely to enjoy Faces, especially the first half.  The second half is much more of a mainstream sound and far less distinctive.  Honestly, for some that might even be a selling point for the album, having some easier songs so you're not out of breath by the time you're done listening.  I would have preferred that they explored some of the innovation of Lie to Me, but there is a reason that they are making the albums instead of me.\n", "val": 0.006269610486924648}

{"text": "Red's third release is cause for celebration, particularly for all of us who like an edge to our modern rock and are tired of wannabes like Nickelback. Years ago, when I listened to Red's first album, I couldn't help but think of their similarities to Linkin Park. Now, two albums later, Red is carrying on the torch that LP dropped an album or two ago.Red builds the first song with a few layers of sound, then takes off on \"Feed the Machine.\" \"Faceless\" and \"Lie to Me\" show no signs of slowing, and it's not till \"Let It Burn\" that we get one of their usual heavy-oriented ballads. From there, it's more vinyl-melters, an actual radio ballad, another vinyl-melter, and then the raw and hard \"The Outside.\" As they've done on other albums, they ease off on the gas toward the end, leaving us with thoughtful words and emotions.Rather than bow to radio expectations for more ballads and hip-hop sounds--as seemed to be the case with the \"other\" band--Red plows ahead with their trademark combination of musical power and lyrical sensitivity. They offer spiritual ideas in ways that are challenging, inspiring, and never sappy. I'm looking forward to catching them at Winter Jam 2011.\n", "val": 0.018101409077644348}
{"text": "I was at a concert back in '06, when RED was just starting out. I picked up End of Silence, had them sign it, and took photos with em, the whole deal. They blew me away, I hadn't heard a band like that in a long time. As a band with Christian fundamentals they were able to take a marketable mainstream sound and put alternatively Christian lyrics with it to make a powerhouse. I grabbed the second album when it came out and was just as hooked, they'd grown up. I didn't care for every track like I did on the first album, but it was still solid and a great purchase (deluxe edition worth it). Now onto the new album.Until We Have Faces is the junior effort of RED, showcasing what they learned from the first two albums. Let me say it was written on tour and hastily, mixed and recorded quickly, and if this gives you insight into my thoughts on it there ya go. This album is mediocre at best, and I've thought it might be from the minute I got the Feed the Machine download. Faceless was better, but only ok.The Breakdown:1. Feed the Machine 2/5 - This song has potential, but instead of coming of as a power play it comes off as whiny. It has the anger behind it that I like from them but instead of following on that it comes off as just pissy. Imagine if you will a big angry man. Impressive, intimidating, but good to have around. Now picture a temper tantrum from a toddler. This song is the latter of those examples. Only gets any points for the guitar work, which is impressive in sound.2. Faceless 3/5 - This song sounds a lot like some of the droning rockers off of Innocence & Instinct. I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, it merely is. Lyrics are better on this one though, and the idea behind it is handled better.3. Lie to Me (Denial) 4/5 - I actually really liked this song. Its one of the first I heard before the album came out (youtube is a wonderful invention guys) and honestly this one's chorus stuck with me. It again reminded me of Innocence & Instinct, but it had more of a memorable chorus than Faceless. This one got me believing in the album again.4. Let it Burn 2.5/5 - This one was again ok but nowhere near stunning. I was disappointed in the lyrics, they seemed to have been more cliche and generic than anything else.5. Buried Beneath 3/5 - A decent track that again has kind of a memorable sounding chorus. Notice I said 'sounding' and not just plain memorable. The lyrics are rather jumbled and bothersome. The words 'i'm suffocating' and 'i'm drowning' are repeated a lot on this album...aren't they...6. Not Alone 2/5 - I understand that they are religious, and I love that about them. This song is their big 'Jesus song' on the album. Its got lyrics that are so religious they're tired, and the music is boring. I understand if this one hits you where your heart is, it just didn't for me. I skip it every time now, its not even interesting to me.7. Watch You Crawl 3.5/5 - I actually kind of like this song. Its got a good sound and really sticks with you, but its in a way that isn't \"crap I gotta get this song out of my head\" but more like sing-along-with-it type sticking. I recommend using it as one of the ones you use to get into the album.8. The Outside 4/5 - Ok here we go, finally a good rocker from RED. Loud, heavy, vocally impressive, feels kind of like a more cleaned up version of something you would have heard on End of Silence. I recommend starting with this one if you're trying to get yourself into the album.9. Who We Are 3/5 - Repetitive lyrics, kind of boring actually, but the sound is good and it'll stay with you and eventually grow on you, I promise. Give it a shot.10. The Best is Yet to Come 3.5/5 - This one is good except for the overall concept behind it. Feels like something you'd hear at a graduation, not on a RED album. Outside that concept its a decent track, you'll bob your head to it.11. Hymn for the Missing 4/5 - A friend once said that it was no longer artsy to end an album with a ballad, but rather that it had grown deuchy. I agree totally and RED gets a slap on the wrist for it here. Having said that, its a great song and I actually loved it, I don't know why.The bonus track was useless and disappointing, not like the last two albums where the deluxe stuff was beyond worth it. Other than that this album was only ok, but you don't really need it. Just wait for album 4, they owe us a good one to match the first two after this downer.\n", "val": 0.0002278809406561777}
{"text": "With no sign of slowing down Red released their third major album called \"Until We Have Faces\".  I had no idea this was album was being released but I loved \"End of Silence\" and \"Innocence and Instinct\" which led me to pick up this album the minute I saw it's release.  I bought this without hearing a single song from it and my trust in Red was repayed in full.  I took the album to the gym to figure out which songs were workout worthy while I was run.  The album starts out very strong with \"Feed the Machine\" and \"Buried Beaneath\" keeping me fully motivated for the entire run.  I listened to \"Hymn for the Missing\" on my walk back and found it contemplative and soothing.  It's an amazing close to this album and I really think it showcases his voice and the range this band offers.  This album shows the same amount, if not more screaming and heavy guitar riffs than Innocence and Instinct.  But I'm the kind of person who likes it when the singer can mix screaming and singing seamlessly into one great sound.  I especially enjoy it when as the music progresses it leads to a moment of screaming that fits with the peak of the song.  I believe Red truly understands this concept and almost everytime I expect them to start yelling they deliver.  And when I fully expect to be able to sing with the song they give me that too.  This album is definitely worth owning if you like Red.  If haven't listened to Red up to this point starting with this album is still a good choice.  But as a warning, you'll want the other two when you hear this one so start wherever you like.  Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.02415652386844158}
{"text": "I've followed Red's music since they came out with their first album. After listening to this album over and over throughout the week, I've got to say that there's been a bit of a progression. When I first started, I thought that the first two songs in the album (Feed the Machine and Faceless) were the only two good songs on the album. As I replayed the album more and more, several more songs grew on me (Lie to Me (Denial), Not Alone, Buried Beneath, and Watch You Crawl). Overall, this is a solid album. I'm a huge fan of the melodic, modern hard rock style that has characterized Red's first two albums, and in that respect, this album does not disappoint. However, I can't mindfully hand this album 5 stars with the awesomeness of the first two albums in mind.I think what got me was that the first two albums had very good songs from cover to cover. There was not a single bad song in those albums that would make me hit the \"NEXT\" button on my iPod. With this album, I think Let it Burn and Hymn for the Missing are weak and sound very lazy around the chorus lines. Listening to those two songs, I keep waiting for the climax to hit during the choruses, maybe even in the bridge sections, but it never comes, and as a result they sound just so boring.That said, the best songs on this album (the first three tracks) are up there among my favorite Red songs of all time, and are possibly even better. The screaming is still there, the phoenix-rising-from-the-ashes feeling is there, the strings are still there, and the well-done lyrics are also still there.Overall, a solid album. But two songs (at least) away from 5 stars in my book.--EDIT (3 weeks later)--After listening to this album over and over again for the last 3 weeks, I think I can now upgrade this to 5 stars. Despite still being two songs away from being a coast-to-coast blockbuster, I think every single other song on this album is probably among my favorite Red songs of all time.\n", "val": 0.0014291814295575023}

We all now know those 2 cds were just stepping stones in the grand process.. UNTIL WE HAVE FACES is the best of both worlds. Were End of Silence had amazing lyrics and heart felt moments, Innocence had catchy riffs and sweet choruses.As where both got boring after a time though,UNTIL WE HAVE FACES shall not.

{"text": "I'm not going to compare this two bands in this review but I just can't help to bring up the bad taste in my mouth after \"A Thousand Suns\", this is kind of what I expected from Linkin after listening to New Divide, I mean, these bands are not much alike but the product result leaves a similar impression like \"Hybrid Theory\" or \"Meteora\" in terms of mainstream rock/nu metal.That said, this is far from being a perfect album, for me (also) is softer than their first two (Innocence & Instinct being my favorite) but I guess much of the heavy parts are REALLY heavy. Other problem is that it is very formulaic, I think they could use more the choirs and the arrangements in the bridges or hopefully guitar solos instead of just heavy riffs and screaming to complement it better, but I'm not complaining, just hoping that for their next release they have more time writing the songs so it won't sound rush or simple.I read the other reviews and pretty much sums up the content of the album and is worth mentioning that I've read actually lots of other reviews and none remarking the album as \"crap\" or \"bad\" so I'm pretty sure you won't be dissapointed.In conclusion, a great way to start the year, not a masterpiece but you'll find pretty awesome things in here I also recommend checking out Times Of Grace debut \"Hymn Of A Broken Man\" seriously...\n", "val": 0.0016557289054617286}
{"text": "Mainstream hard rock is an unfortunate genre, generally stacked with a list of number one hits that reach the top less by musical talent and more by their clean fit into blockbuster films and into fashionable youth-centered shopping outlets. Red certainly does not bother trying to break out much, even if it fits in the heaviest subcategory of the over-filled genre. However, Red has an \"X\" factor here - it may be all formula, but it is also all heart.The biggest thing that separates \"Until We Have Faces\" from the Nashville rockers' previous work is a much-welcomed substitution of melodrama with genuine talent. It's never been easy (if even possible) to lodge a complaint against lead singer Barnes' vocal prowess - fluctuating between a smoother Chris Daughtry at times, a rather angry Josh Groban at others, and, impressively, an emotionally charged Tim Lambesis (of As I Lay Dying fame) at yet others. Yet, with this album, the music quality has been kicked up more than just a notch. The safe-rock characteristics of Red's previous albums have been ditched in favor of much more ambition. Guitars are split into multiple parts rather than played in unison, and drums pound out much more complex rhythms, using the double-bass pedal much more than what would be expected from a band of this genre. There is actually quite a bit of heavy metal influence here - more so than many self-proclaimed \"metal\" bands themselves convey. Likewise, the strings, synths, and background vocals are cut down to see time only when they are appropriate, not every moment (looking at you, \"Innocence and Instinct\").In fact, this album really never works against itself. Production quality is arguably perfect, and the track listing provides an interesting listen from start to finish. The kickoff comes in the form of the incredibly aggressive \"Feed the Machine.\" Where most hard rock bands would suffice with a short, two-and-a-half-minute burst of energy at the beginning of an album, Red effectively draws the song out for over five minutes. Since the rest of the album never really matches the intensity found here at the start, the length is actually appreciated because it's just so satisfying. It is said that it is better to leave the listener wanting more than wanting less, but finding that sweet spot between the two is an achievement on its own. \"Faceless\" slows things down just a bit, but compliments the first song perfectly. The album feels rather formulaic from this point on, but it is almost impossible not to get behind the tight rhythms, technical riffs, and gorgeous melodies heard throughout. The album swings between heavy ballad and fist-pumping rock from here, with the climax coming in at \"Watch You Crawl,\" which reinstates some of the energy found in \"Feed the Machine\" to carry the album to its end. This is where the listener hears Red at their finest, laying down some of the best lyrical, melodic, and rhythmic work the band has ever done. The album's energy starts to decline at this point, but only on a smooth curve that keeps things interesting. \"Best Is Yet To Come\" is the last (and best) rock ballad of the album, and it's followed by the epic \"Hymn for the Missing\" which starts out softly with pianos and strings and, thankfully, remains soft until the end.Red's latest is, at its core, the perfect mainstream hard rock album. The lyrical message is honest yet hopeful and upbeat, the music is well-crafted and nuanced with technical complexity, the production is tight, and the vocals stand out as some of the best in any genre today. Red has certainly proven themselves to be forceful and aggressive while retaining a wide appeal. Perhaps the subtle ambition in this album will further spur the group to think a bit more outside the box and craft something more unique on their next project, but for now, \"Until We Have Faces\" is as impressive as modern rock albums come. If modern mainstream rock is remembered twenty years from now, Red should be one of the names associated with the genre. Here is an album that makes stereotypical schlock un-typically slick.Ten-Point Scale: 8.5 out of 10Genre: Hard Rock / Modern RockRecommended: HighlyNOTE: Many people have complained that this album is, in fact, not heavier than their previous work, which was something hyped about the album. This is a misunderstanding of the term \"heavy\" - More overall volume, louder guitars, or faster drums do not make for a \"heavier\" sound, per se. It would be nearly impossible to make anything here \"louder\" than their previous work and it still be digestible at all. This album incorporates many more heavy-metal-styled riffs and rhythms than in previous works, which results in a significantly heavier musical structure. Red has always been louder and more aggressive-sounding than, say, even most Metallica, yet Red remains mainstream rock and Metallica remains heavy metal. Red is, however, much more pop-like in song structure and chord progression, while Metallica does far more experimentation and uses both fast and slow rhythmic breakdowns and guitar solos/duets to achieve it's sound. In this regard, \"Until We Have Faces\" more closely resembles classic metal than simply much-louder pop-rock. This is just an observation from a musician - perhaps this sheds light on why I (as well as Red) view this album as being much heavier than the others.\n", "val": 0.006587244104593992}

{"text": "First, let me just say that I had fully planned to not buy this album because I am only interested in physical releases and I will never switch over to buying mp3 albums. When I saw that Itunes was getting an exclusive track called \"Until We Have Faces\", I made the decision that I was done letting record labels punish me (and other true fans who do want the physical releases) by giving us less music for our money. Nothing encourages piracy more in my eyes than when record labels/bands cut songs off of albums and try to sell us incomplete albums or give certain versions/countries exclusive songs. All fans should be treated equally, no matter where they buy their albums or in whatever format they choose.However, after I was able to confirm that (this rare time) the exclusive Itunes track was only an instrumental intro (albeit one that should have stayed as an intro for \"Feed The Machine\" on the physical release), I went ahead and bought a copy of this new album, and I am glad I did. Despite what many Red fans are saying though, I find this to be Red's softest album to date. Really only \"Feed The Machine\", \"Faceless\", \"Who We Are\" and \"The Outside\" are what I would consider the 'heavier' type songs. This album has several mid--level rocker tracks and a few power ballads and these songs are the ones that stand out for me. I am a sucker for great  melodies and memorable hooks and they definitely deliver. These songs include \"Lie To Me (Denial)\" which is destined to be a future single, \"Let It Burn\", \"Buried Beneath\" (which is another catchy song with a great chorus hook), \"Not Alone\" and the anthem-like \"Who We Are\" (although there is some annoying static-like noise in this song). Honestly, there was not one song I wanted to skip though.With that being said, the song that impressed me the most is the piano/orchestra driven  album closer \"Hymn For The Missing\". The chorus of this song has such a beautiful melody to it that I got chills when I heard it. And then to top it off, there are some subtle (but gorgeous) etheral female vocals harmonizing in the background, which really compliments the orchestra especially as it picks up for the haunting instrumental climax at around the 4:30 mark. Perhaps my only complaint about this soul soothing song is that after the instrumental climax, I would have loved to hear one final chorus with both Michael Barnes and Kellie Roberts (the female vocalist) singing together. But even without this, the song is powerful and easily compares with \"Pieces\" from their debut release for being their most beautiful song.Red is one of the very rare bands within the Christian rock market where I feel that they put just as much effort into the melodies they write, as they put into their lyrics. Most of the \"preachy\" bands, I can not get into because they concentrate solely on the worshipping aspect and very rarely touch upon the undeniable fact that there is A LOT of frustration and confusion in not only being a Christian, but being alive in general. Red covers this with true power and skill to where they are appealing to the Christian rock market, along with the mainstream rock market. They mix a Linkin Park-ish rock vibe (back from when LP were still a good rock band at least) in with the orchestras for a symphonic rock sound that I normally had to go to female fronted European bands like Within Temptation or Delain to find. And this album is no exception. UNTIL WE HAVE FACES still manages to build some epic sounding atmosphere to the background of their guitar-driven rock, while toning the anger down a little from their previous two releases.Overall, the album has helped get me excited for good rock music again after an abysmal 2010. It's the first release since Katatonia's recent masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Night-Is-the-New-Day/dp/B002NXX8EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Night Is the New Day</a>&nbsp;that has made me feel like many repeat replays are in order. And with more future albums coming from Within Temptation, The Panic Division, Cyrenic, A Perfect Circle and others, it looks like 2011 is off to a promising start.\n", "val": 0.003871608292683959}
{"text": "This album, overall, I think has the best songs out of Red.  They're more emotionally intense than Red's previous albums and they do have more of a positive spin (though they still are mournful).  The one thing that sticks out for me are the instrumental solos: they sound unique and fit with the style of Red.  I have to say that either songs are much better than previous songs or a little worse.  When I worse, I mean bad on the scale of Red's music.  I believe all songs trump any Christian music out there and arguably any secular music out there, too.This album has very interesting and unique instrumental intros.  They seem influenced by Evanescence, but more techno and pop.  Of course, in true Red fashion, the strings are back!  They add a good contrast to the gruff electric guitars and compliment Michael Barnes' smooth, mournful voice.I do have a few criticism, though, but they're not worth knocking off a star.  For one, Red still screams, and I'm not much of a fan of screams.  There are three ballads on this album (\"Not Alone,\" \"Best is Yet to Come,\" and \"Hymn for the Missing\") and Hymn for the Missing sounds like it's trying to be more despite the fact it's not that noteworthy. Many songs seem to be \"chants,\" too (\"Who We Are\")...more of a rock pep song with no mournful tone for which Red is noteworthy.My favorite songs are \"Best is Yet to Come,\" \"Not Alone,\" \"Faceless,\" \"Buried Beneath,\" and \"Let it Burn.\"In short, this album is definitely better than any music these days.  Is it better than \"End of Silence\" and \"Innocence and Instinct?\"  Hard to say...this album has a different feel to it compared to the other two.  Would I recommend it?  Do you have to ask?\n", "val": 0.008013552986085415}

Like their previous albums, Bright Morning Stars sounds great the first time you hear it, and just gets better and better with each subsequent listening.  This is the first studio album with Heather Masse and, like Cara Luft and Annabelle Chvostek before her, she brings a new dimension to the Jennys with her sultry voice and jazzy, swingy songs.As other reviewers have noted, this album is more highly produced than earlier ones, but the voices are still front and centre - exactly where they should be.  Highlights for me include Ruth's You Are Here and Storm Comin', Nicky's What Has Been Done and Heather's Mona Louise.  No Jennys album would be complete without at least one a capella number.  This time it's the title track Bright Morning Stars - a traditional Appalachian folk song beautifully rendered.  There's not a bad song on the album.  In fact, it's hard to imagine the Jennys doing anything that isn't fabulous.I hope the Jennys go on luring sailors onto the rocks for many years to come.\n", "val": 0.018018299713730812}
{"text": "I am writing this review as an English fan of the Wailin' Jennys. Having three other albums by this Canadian ( one American) all-female trio -  ie  'The Wailin' Jennys' (6 track eponymous EP) '40 Days'  and 'Firecracker ' I have been  eagerly awaiting this new release, especially as it had been recommended by singer Mary Chapin Carpenter who had nothing but praise for it. The band has changed its lineup over the years but the current members are as melodic as ever. They have been named by previous reviewers so no need for me to name them here, but I will say in case a few people don't know that they named themselves after (for) Waylon Jennings as a pun on his name soon after he died in February 2002. This album has 13 tracks on it but to be honest I feel there are perhaps a couple of tracks too many, and I would suggest tracks 4 and 5 are the ones that are weaker than the others. These songs were all written by the Jenny's other than one traditional song. I hadn't heard any of these songs beforehand.  The remaining 11 tracks are very acoustic and melodic and bring out their close harmony vocals so well. Favourite tracks for me are ' Bird Song ' ' Bright Morning Stars'  'Across The Sea' ' Cherry Blossom Love' and 'Last Goodbye' and of those I love the title track best as it is sung a capella which shows their close harmony singing off excellently as did ' Parting Glass' on their ' 40 Days' album. If you like close harmony female voices then this album is for you and I don't hesitate in recommending it. Why only 4 stars?  Well I have deducted one as I feel the album is a bit too long and a couple of tracks are not to my taste.\n", "val": 0.003861602395772934}

This is a gorgeous CD.  Their vocals are flawless, and some remind me of the transcendent moments in some of the songs done by Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris, and Dolly Parton together (Trio CD's).  There is a peaceful \"vibe\" to this CD, so that if you are looking for something rocking, you won't find it--though there are some bluesy and alt-country songs.  It is serene and I enjoy CD's that have that feeling without interruption. Reference points for my taste are Patty Griffin, Jane Siberry, Emmylou Harris, reincarnated acoustic Cyndi Lauper, Innocence Mission.  Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.03570724278688431}

{"text": "For anyone unfamiliar with the Wailin' Jennys (harmonisers extraordinaire), the current line up is : Ruth Moody - soprano, Nicky Mehta - mezzo, and Heather Masse - alto (although I tend to refer to her as a contralto because of her sultry edge when she hits the lower notes). It's been over 4 years since the release of their previous studio album. With past albums, the instrumental accompaniment was shared between the Jennys and additional players; here, most of the instrumental support is provided by a crack team of Canadian session musicians - the playing features a wide range of stringed instruments (including electric guitar on about half of the tracks) plus rhythms from acoustic guitar, acoustic/electric bass and drums/percussion on many tracks.Compared to earlier studio albums, 'Bright Morning Stars' has a more polished sound. Whilst I prefer the more stripped back sound of those earlier albums, there is no denying that this album is beautifully put together*, and both the playing and the vocals (including the harmonies, of course) are impeccable (although I could have done without the whistling on 'Away But Never Gone') ~ *the one exception being the final track, 'Last Goodbye', which sounds over-engineered/ compressed to me.The album comprises 12 songs penned by individual members of the band plus 1 'trad. arr.' and, as on past albums, each Jenny takes the lead vocals on her own song. There is a good range of tempos and the songs draw upon a number of different influences - including folk, pop, bluegrass, gospel and cabaret-jazz. For me, there are 4 or 5 songs on this album which are somewhat bland - the song-writing has lost some of its melodic touch of old; for sure, the songs are subtle, pretty and very easy on the ear, but they just don't hold my attention. On the other hand, there are 3 songs that I really enjoy - some comments about these :STORM COMIN' (Ruth Moody) - A slow burning 'gospel-blues' number featuring soulful vocals from Ruth (sounding more like an alto than a soprano). Includes an understated half minute dobro solo; rhythm features dampened bass drum and electric bass. It's great stuff - the Jennys certainly know how to groove when they put their minds to it!BRIGHT MORNING STARS (a cappella) (Trad. arr. The Wailin' Jennys) - If you haven't heard the Jennys sing a cappella, you haven't lived! This is right up there with 'The Parting Glass' and 'Long Time Traveller' - absolutely stunning harmonies. I'm not familiar with the song but, according to the 'Lullaby Link' website, it's a traditional Appalachian folk song.BIRD SONG (Heather Masse) - All of the Jennys are fine singers, but Heather Masse has a seductive contralto which is a bit special - a guilty pleasure (just like luxury drinking chocolate laced with honey). She uses it to good effect on this charming mid-tempo song. The banjo (Ruth) and violin (Jeremy Penner) accompaniment lend the song more of a traditional feel than some of the others.There are some nice instrumental touches to listen out for, including : dobro (the aforementioned 'Storm Comin''), slide electric guitar ('What Has Been Done'), flugelhorn ('Across The Sea') and high string acoustic guitar ('You Are Here').I found this album to be rather uneven in terms of the songs, and the production is a little too polished for my own taste - but I have no complaints about the vocals or the playing; and yet again, the listener is treated to some of the sweetest (and closest) folk harmonies you're ever likely to hear - in this respect, there is no-one else to match The Wailin' Jennys (that I can think of).\n", "val": 0.002062061335891485}
{"text": "Bright Morning Stars is certainly an appropriate name: The Wailin' Jennys once again combine stellar songwriting, brilliant arrangements, and heavenly harmonies in their latest album.With the opening notes, listeners will notice some changes from the group's prior studio work. Mark Howard (Lucinda Williams, Marianne Faithful, The Tragically Hip) joined the Jennys' long-time collaborator David Travers-Smith to co-produce the new album.  The result, at times, is a fuller, more layered sound than the group's earlier studio recordings, their self-titled EP (2003), 40 Days (2004), and Firecracker (2006). But that result never overpowers the rightful focus on the vocals: three singer-songwriters with beautifully distinctive individual voices, each singing lead on her own original songs, yet blending together with each other perfectly to produce the flawlessly lush close harmonies for which the group has become known.This is the trio's first studio album with alto Heather Masse (the group's \"token American\"), who in early 2007 joined founding Canadian members, soprano Ruth Moody and mezzo Nicky Mehta. The album includes one traditional song, the title track arranged by the group and sung a cappella, and twelve originals. As on their prior studio albums, the Jennys share equally in the songwriting duties, with each of the three contributing four original songs that somehow manage to sound both contemporary and traditional, and combine a broad range of influences, from roots, folk and Americana, to acoustic pop, to gospel and jazz.Because there isn't a weak one in the lot, it's difficult to single out a song for comment.  But still it's hard not to mention Storm Comin'. This rousing gospel number by Moody has become a crowd favorite at live shows, where the group performs it a cappella, accompanied to great effect with only hand-rubbing, clapping, and stomping feet.  For the studio version, stunning yet minimal instrumentation is added.  The subtle opening chords perfectly evoke the shimmering electric feeling that the air takes on as a summer thunderstorm bears down.The album's closing song, by Mehta, is somewhat ominously entitled Last Goodbye.  But the lyrics appear to refer not to saying goodbye forever, but rather never having to say goodbye again. Let's hope that's the meaning here, and that we'll continue to be treated to dazzling albums like this from The Wailin' Jennys for many years to come.\n", "val": 0.010506337508559227}
{"text": "Light Me Up  The Pretty Reckless 2011 album is a good debut for Taylor and the boys. It is a popish heavy metal album that kind of reminds me of (beware SoCal reference here) KNAC and the Sunset Strip, you know, that spawned 80s metal; But Taylor Momsen is way sexier than Brett Michaels or Vince Neil ever were  at least to me, and her voice is distinctive enough that she is easily recognizable. Speaking of Taylors vocals, they are emotive, full of attitude, and just plain sexy. Unlike most of those early/mid-eighties hair metal bands The Pretty Reckless has at least a little bit of punk attitude/influence. In case you are lost with the reference to the Southern California 80s metal stuff KNAC was a local hard rock/heavy metal radio station (I think still functioning online) and the infamous Sunset Strip clubs (even though not all were on Sunset Blvd. and not all that were there deserved the abysmal rep.) that abused the dreams of gullible and star-struck musicians (most of whom were young and some were actually skilled and dedicated players) with the insidious pay-to-play scheme that ultimately destroyed that scene. Enough with the local history  back to The Pretty Reckless. Overall the songs are kind of catchy with good hooks and clever lyrics. All is well sung and played. I like the rockers better than the power ballads; your mileage may vary. My favorite track is probably the, sort-of-kinky, teenage murder ballad: Goin Down, yeah subject matter tends toward the dark and dysfunctional. If you like this album youll probably welcome the more recent Going to Hell even more, from me that gets 5 stars instead of the 4 Light Me Up gets here.Sound quality is both as good and bad as I expect from a major label release. On the consummate side is the sound captured on all vocals and instruments, with great tone and appropriate frequency extension. The mix is artful with all elements being audible and easy to aurally follow. As with many multitrack recordings don't expect much in the way of imaging, but stereo separation is good. The recording has tremendous punchiness too, which takes us immediately to the glaring problem with the recording  dynamic compression. Like with most current pop recordings the ability to constrict dynamics to achieve overall loudness without crossing the limits of the distribution formats maximum headroom is abused here, robbing the music of all dynamic expression. Meaning everything is loud, which works for listening in high noise floor environments like the car (where road noise can hide quiet portions) or in low resolution formats like mp3; but, when you listen on a quality system in a quiet place it is just loud with an obvious loss of dynamic range and expression which can raid the music of realism, and emotional and expressive impact. Too much compression lends an immediate ear catchiness but ultimately leads to listening fatigue. Other than this commonly excessive practice it all sounds pretty fantastic.Packaging is what should be expected of a major label CD release: great photography and layout, quality printing in the ten-page booklet, a small but legible font used on the lyrics and info, and a few beautiful glamour shots of the lovely Ms. Momsen, all stuffed in a standard jewel case. If you purchase directly from Amazon you also get an AutoRip mp3 version of the album.\n", "val": 0.012316455133259296}

I don't recall hearing any singles form \"Light Me Up\" but who doesn't remember \"Follow Me Down\" and :Heaven Knows\".As a 1st album this is really pretty good. Musically this isn't very experimental or pregressive. It's a standard rock set. What makes this special then is Taylor Momsen's voice and the lyrics. The lyrics tell a dark tale of drugs, alcohol, sex and sexual abuse. So even though the music is modern-rock conservative it will build an audience. So as the audience builder album it works well and act as a gateway to the more populist \"Going to Hell\". The two best songs are \"The Walls are closing in/hangman\" and \"Mad love\".

The singer's voice is also very good and on most songs you will feel like humming along or singing along in your car or at home.  Track one expresses the effects of drugs on the singer's life, track two another good rock song with decent lyrics but personally prefer the live version found on the CD single \"Hit Me Like A Man.\"  Track 3 is a song you can't help but sing along to and relate to the lyrics at some point in your life \"I'll Never Be Good Enough\", track 4 is a song with strange lyrics but the singer is right about one main thing no matter how much we desire to change \"Can't Be Anything Else But Me.\"  Track 5 is another song you can hum along to and enjoy moving to the music but in the end she will get her revenge on those who hurt her, track 6 shows how much you want to numb out the pain, hurt, so you take anything to drown it out but for \"Just Tonight.\"  Track 7 shows how fast fame, fortune comes to your life, and then in blink of an eye it's turns you into \"Miss Nothing, track 8 is a song about the singer looking for her hero to save her from 'Going Down.\"  Track 9 is another song about trying to fill the void in your life but this time trying to find it in love, religion, or even fame in the form of \"Rock and Roll\", track 10 threw the pain and sorrow you need that special someone to help you get threw it and keep you going.  Last track 11 is a feel good song about enjoy life and having fun by trying to get into the parties and you can move to the music bob your head or body threw the song start to end.\n", "val": 0.013476633466780186}

{"text": "Wow, what an album. The opener My Medicine is an absolute spine tingler, a power riff as many have said along the lines of The White Stripes, but that doesn't do it justice. What a great vocal, full of attitude and sass. This girl is a huge talent, and shows her full range throughout this album. What makes it so great is that it has variation, little twists and nods to the history of hard rock. There are Pink type moments, Cre type moments, and yet there is a vibrancy and honesty to this, something heartfelt rather then manufactured. Taylor reminds me of the trashy sexiness Wendy James used to evoke for Transvision Vamp, that 'you want but you can't have' attitude that is at the basis of the appeal. The majority of the songs on here are killer, no mean feat, with the last song Factory Girl a storming, stomping satisfying finale. I have rarely been so enthused by a new band. Great stuff.\n", "val": 0.024878855794668198}

{"text": "Taylor Momsen shines on this debut album by her band \"The Pretty Reckless.\" Though rock music can often times be found stale from an over-saturated market and radio, The Pretty Reckless brings a new take to the genre with as much ease as The Beatles brought to their own sound.  \"Light Me Up\" is a collection of hard hitting songs that both showcase grand musicianship, and extraordinary vocal work by Ms. Taylor Momsen herself.  Though she was known for her acting, such as in Dr. Suess's How The Grinch Stole Christmas and Gossip Girl, Taylor is reinvented here as a woman ready to take the world head on.  Her growling and eiry vocals leave a haunting echo in the listeners heart, as she sings both personal and sometimes twisted lyrics over smashing drums and dirty guitars.Stand out tracks include the songs \"Miss Nothing\" and \"Just Tonight\" - two songs that though polar opposites almost in lyrical themes, offer the same melody driven groove that gets retained in your mind long after listening.  The idea that rock and roll is dead obviously wasn't known to The Pretty Reckless, \"Light Me Up\" is proof that rock music with high intelligence is not only plausible, but executable.Taylor Momsen is a stand out singer and front runner, offering the perfect blend of classical vocals with rough around the edges growling. She's confident, driven and a talented lyricist that only help to push the pleasantries of the music.  With \"Light Me Up\" being a debut, it's clear there's a lot more to be had from this band, and each follow up is only destined to be better.\n", "val": 0.019160592928528786}

Just like you would expect a rock band to be, some of these songs are a bit controversial. There is honestly not a song on here that I didn't like though. I find myself listening to this again and again, and my husband sheepishly admits that he really enjoys it also. If you like bands like Halestorm, Cherry Bomb, Paramore, In This Moment, or some of Avril's older rock hits, you would probably really enjoy this.\n", "val": 0.0062866052612662315}

This has a real mid nineties Hole feel to it for me for a lot of the album with a little more light hearted party girl than Mrs. Cobain could have ever managed.My biggest issue with the music is that the band seems to try to hard to emulate some of the grunge scene, especially the afore mentioned Hole and Nirvana.  There isn't a guitar solo to be found on the album.  The players seem more than capable of at least a few short bridges here and there.

I think she needs to learn how to dress (the dead whore look is getting old) and someone should steal her eyeliner, but she definitely has control of her voice and commands a pretty awesome concert. I now listen to this album and sing along with about every song. A couple I skip, just because they are kind of messed up (hint hint-Goin' down). Most songs are rock with a touch of goth. Almost a classic rock sound. However, the song \"You\" is really very pretty with strings and an acoustic guitar. I don't think there is any language in this album, which is nice.

The musicians can actually play their instruments.I hope this band produces more CDs with the same energy level (like Crow's Globe recordings) that keeps bringing you back to hear it again.My only suggestion would be to cool it with the drugs in the songs, if Taylor were actually consuming that many drugs she would sing and look like Dylan on the stage in Victoria's Secret nighties.

{"text": "I am a huge metal fan and I didn't even know who Taylor Momsen was until she graced the pages of Revolver magazine.  I generally like really hard stuff and this normally wouldn't make the cut for me.  BUT softer, more hardrock-oriented styles lend themselves better to female vocalists (and I dig good female rock vocalists, Evanescence anyone?).  I have to say that Taylor has a very interesting voice with a unique style.  She isn't ripping anyone off. In fact, I saw an acoustic version of one of the Pretty Reckless songs on Youtube out of Revolver-inspired curiosity. I had this preconcieved idea of what she would sound like and ended up being blown away.  The songs are well-written and consistently strong without being ballad heavy like a lot of female-fronted bands are.  Overall it is definately a rockin album.  I only have two critical points.  One is: Where are the guitar solos? Although as a guitar player I might be biased. Nonetheless, the songs are fine without them, but I think on at least a few songs a nice guitar solo here or there (nothing too crazy) would've really spiced things up. Perhaps on the next release (which I will definately check out).  The other thing is that the lyrical content kinda has that teenage angst, \"finding myself\" thing, but I'd expect that from such a young artist.  Younger people will surely latch onto this. On the other hand, it is mostly implied and some of the metaphors she uses allow you to read what you want into the lyrics--kinda like Nirvana, but more coherent.  I love it when bands do that.  The lyrics are also dark, which is right up my ally.  The lyrical subject matter is not obnoxious though (contrast with someone of the likes of Avril Lavigne who is a good song writer, albeit marginally talented in comparison, who ruined many songs on her debut with juvenile lyrics).  Moreover, there is none of that \"I'm cool because I'm trying oh so hard to not be cool\" type stuff.  In fact, I am very impressed with her writing ability both lyrically and musically.  It is very mature, all things considered.  I will cut her some slack because after all, she was 16 when she recorded this stuff, which amazes me.  I think that if this band stays together the albums will only get better.  Taylor is very talented and has shown that she can deliver. I hope she takes that attitude of hers and rocks even harder on the next album. Taylor, you've already impressed us, now punch us in the face!\n", "val": 0.011743155308067799}

As we all know, very few actresses can pull off doing the singer thang...But she does it VERY well. She sounded awesome in concert! the music actually sounds harder live than on the album.

Being a mom of a little girl, I must say if she was older I wouldn't want her idolizing/copying her style. But I can't resist rocking out (and working out) to her music. She's a true rocker at heart. And if she keeps writing her own stuff and doing what she's doing, I know her music will just get even more amazing.\n", "val": 0.03694760426878929}
{"text": "I have never seen an episode of Gossip girl and the first time I saw the way lead-singer Taylor Momsen normally dresses, I instantly disliked herand assumed I would hate her band as well. But when I came across one of The Pretty Reckless' songs on Youtube I found myself liking it. Then, after researching the album a little and buying it, I couldn't help but love the whole thing.Their sound is punkish, loud and angry with driving beats, fronted by Momsen's undeniably great voice. Lyrically, the music is somewhat simple, and to the more cynical, contrived--mostly about about gothic heartbreak, angst, pills, etc. But for me the enjoyment really outweighed the drawbacks.For what it's worth, it's nice to see a child star pumping out something other than annoying, fluffy, techno-pop. If you can ignore the upscale-hooker look Taylor Momsen has adopted, that is.But what's most important about the album is that you don't have to like the former Gossip Girl to like The Pretty Reckless. In fact, I encourage you to check them out if you don't.\n", "val": 0.015439458191394806}

Every song on the album is good, but the standouts to me are Make Me Wanna Die, Light Me Up, Just Tonight, and my favorite Miss Nothing.

{"text": "I'm not exactly sure how to classify this album, so here goes. This band is a combination for Emo, Pop, Rock, Metal, and I guess because they could a little Goth. Now I'm not going to say they sound like Nickleback because they don't the only thing the 2 bands share is high energy. Fronted by Taylor Momsen from CW's Gossip Girl, yea not something you would expect to hear that an actress is the singer of band and does a good job at it, but she does and that there shows she has alot of talent. You can tell from listening to this band that the pop music influence can be heard in her vocals but then again you have to look at bands like Lacuna Coil, In this Moment, and Nightwish that you don't have to scream in a metal band. Would I rate Taylor as an equal to Cristina Scabbia, no but she has potential to be on her level and much more. The guitar rifts are good but have an emo feel sometimes and other times like a hard rock band, but then again I am a bit biased because I'm a metal DJ but overall I would still play a couple of songs off this album in my set list as it still is technically metal no matter how you look at it, and a nice start up pace for whats to come.

{"text": "This is the best \"rock\" music I've heard in a long time.  The lead singer has an amazing voice.  The CD has not left my car's CD player since I first inserted it.Song themes are geared toward troubled (in my opinion), young girls.  (Not my preference for subject matter; however, they are what they are.)  I hope these themes do not reflect typical themes in typical young girls' lives.I knocked my rating down one star due to lyrical content.  I.e., in Goin' Down she sings  \"I'm just 16, if you know what I mean.  Do you mind if I take off my dress?\"  Later on she sings \"I noticed your breathing has started to change.  We could go in the back behind all these stacks of bibles and get out of this cage.\"  The fact that this occurs in a Catholic Confessional is not bothersome.  The fact that she's confessing the murder of a cheating lover is not bothersome.  It's that the images of pedophilia are not desirable or necessary.Looking forward to next album.  Based on additional tunes found on YouTube, seems like they have sufficient material to put out another CD.  Even the stripped down acoustic performances are amazing.\n", "val": 0.007795605342835188}
{"text": "You must be at least three feet tall to listen to this album... The Pretty Reckless takes its listeners on an emotional roller coaster ride with \"Light Me Up,\" from DAS Label and Interscope Records. This band can pull-off various tempos in music, from hard rock with a head-banging pulse to a sad lyrical. If a good album is defined by the ability to listen to its entirety and not be bored by monotony, this is a good album.  I was familiar with \"Make Me Wanna Die\" from the Kick Ass soundtrack and I remember being impressed with the vocals. I loved the song but I didn't expect to be overwhelmed by this freshman release. The first few tracks are absolutely raw rock-n-roll, sometimes with a nice funky bass. \"Just Tonight\" slows things down a bit for a nice break-up before they pick things back up with the moderately driving \"Miss Nothing.\" \"Going Down\" has a nice story with ...unexpected consequences. As a fan and player of acoustic instruments, I love it when bands will add at least one all-acoustic track; TPR does it with a chorus of strings in their song \"You.\" More please!  It's refreshingly nice to hear rockin' female vocals along with a band that can \"shred it up.\" Taylor Momsen, lead vocalist, sometimes reminds me of Gwen Stefani from No Doubt. The songs are melodically impressive and not overly typical. Lyrically, they are appropriate and relatable, but not incredibly inventive.  Hearing this release was a wonderful surprise and I can't wait to see where this band goes from here. The vocals are second-to-none and the music is perfect rock-n-roll that doesn't get stale throughout the album. With this being said, keep your hands and feet inside the car and enjoy the ride.\n", "val": 0.027419649064540863}

{"text": "I first heard the single \"Make Me Wanna Die\" and was instantly impressed. I immediately went to check them out, bought their EP and then ordered this album from the UK as soon as I could. Even after my initial positive reaction, this album blows me away. Its beyond its years, its melodic, its heavy, its fast, its happy, its sad, it fits the bands name to a T - it really is pretty reckless rock n roll at its absolutely finest! Taylor's voice is gorgeous and way more mature than it should be and I mean that in the best way possible. Her voice is heavy, raspy at times, exactly what rock music has been missing. Other times her voice is just absolutely gorgeous, the guitar seems to duet with her and fit completely perfectly.  This is one of those albums I go to listen to one song and end up listening to the entire album because every single is song is as amazing as the one before it, its hard to pick a favorite.  If you're tired of the same old pop rock crap, pick up this album. This band and this album is way different than you might expect if you try to pre-judge them based on Taylor's age or looks.  I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed. Taylor is not just a pretty face, she and her band have the skills to back it up and this is just the beginning.

{"text": "I first heard this song a week ago when a friend played it during a DJ set and I was hooked immediately.  I dig so hard on simplistic bass lines and the eerie sci-fi sounds are icing on this beautiful cake.  Still, Busta's all I heard, but at that point I was on board and online shopping for a download EXCITED.After hearing the track in its entirety, however, I'm disenchanted.  The intro is spooky good until Busta throws a hat in and it's over.  Or should have been.  Lil' Wayne's contribution I hadn't heard when my friend was playing as he mixed out beforehand and I'm holding it against him that he didn't warn me.  It's not that Wayne's an average rapper, but compared to Busta, on THIS track?  He sounds like a lagging amateur and that's how nasty Busta is here.  Add that to a tacked on and trite homosexual slam and Wayne came out the gates tried and tired.  It's not that I'm particularly sensitive to gay-bashing, but I am sensitive to worn out ignorance in general.  Especially when it's unoriginal and uninspired - I've heard it all before and it's played out.  Rhyme like an intelligent man and leave the garbage out back unless you can breathe something fresh into the hate.  Please.It's frustrating to hear a song with genre-bending potential get drowned in repetition. And wishing Busta ran and spit this track on his own without a suddenly sub-par sidekick and a woman beater on board feels a bit depressing, too.  I don't like throwing money at a child that doles out cat scratches and black eyes to his women before releasing a song with flaccid, repetitive references to his genitalia.Purchasing the song either says something painful about my own moral character or screams volumes for the pieces of the track I adore.

Of course I listen to other music at work as well, but at lest w/ this I don't find the other half of my brain wandering off about the lyrics, what other projects I have going on at home, or the creative writing I also squeeze into a busy schedule.And apparently I'm not the only one.

Mr. Maddock told me that he composed/recorded/played in the moment without any editing and without anything written or scored. The listener would never guess. The pieces are richly textured with polished melody and themes. From the published bio, it seems that Mr. Maddock has been about this for a long time, especially for ballet music. Nevertheless, it is quite a skill to sit down and compose well-written music at a single sitting, Mozart notwithstanding. It's always a treat to learn about talented contemporary artists, since it's so difficult for them to become widely known.If on satellite radio, one would expect to find this album under \"spa music.\"  It is played in adagio to create a reflective, relaxed mood.

This is a similar idea in terms of general atmosphere and caliber of music -- just with guitar instead of native flutes. One of the artists -- Ben Tavera King -- was also featured on that collection, making the parallel between the two sets even more convincing.But while the native flute collection had both a novelty and ethnic factor that added some value and interest, this guitar-based set has much less of that. Yes, there is the world \"Celtic\" in the title, but this doesn't come through much except on the track \"Jane's Toye Jig\" which does indeed have at least something of an Irish swing to it. On the whole, I found about half the tracks kept my attention enough to keep them in my library.A lot of what made the cut were the reworkings of classical music hits -- like Puccini's \"O Mio Babbino Caro\", the Habanera from Bizet's \"Carmen\", a reworking of Satie's Gymnopedie No. 1, and an excerpt from Mozart's \"Magic Flute\".Overall, this is a nice collection for the price, but I didn't feel it opened any eyes, doors or horizons. Just pleasant relaxing guitars -- which sometimes border on being TOO pleasant and relaxing, even for an old man like me.Not quite my taste, but yours may be different. In fact, I know some people just love this kind of music; for them, this will be a real treat, as you see in some of the other reviews.

{"text": "My original review of this album was based on a single, shallow listen to this album in which I brushed it off as a more pop-oriented effort on the part of Buck 65. However, after taking some time to let it sink in, it has really grown on me and I've really come to view it as another masterpiece on the part of Canada's premier hip hop artist. With 20 Odd Years (named to commemorate his 20 years as a hip hop artist), Buck continues his tradition of incorporating many different genres under the umbrella of \"hip hop,\" but this album sounds like it meets somewhere in the middle of Buck's two previous albums, Secret House Against the World and Situation.  While I consider SHATW to be one of Buck's best albums, it is at times very somber and just flat out strange for the casual listener. Situation is Buck's attempt at his own special brand of straight-forward hip hop. 20 Odd Years takes the best elements of both, combining the artsy experimentalism from SHATW with the more upbeat hip hop of Situation.The opening track \"Superstars Don't Love,\" which appears to be something of an ode to Michael Jackson, would have probably fit right in on Situation and is one of the albums most straight-forward hip hop tracks, along with \"Lights Out.\"  Tracks such as \"Gee Whiz,\" \"Whispers of the Waves,\" \"Paper Airplanes\" and \"Who By Fire\" (a Leonard Cohen cover) feature Buck's signature blend of country, western, and folk with hip hop.  Songs like \"Stop,\" \"BCC,\" and \"Final Approach\" are amongst some of Buck 65's most pop-oriented tracks.  Still, the album features some oddities, like \"Zombie Delight,\" a comical instructional for how to survive a zombie apocalypse driven by a bluesy guitar riff. \"Tears of Your Heart\" is especially reminiscent of Secret House Against the World with French female-sung vocals accompanied by chamber pop instrumentation and post-punk guitar riffing. \"Cold Steel Drum\" is an electro-hop piece featuring the vocals of Jenn Grant, and is one of the albums' best songs. \"She Said Yes\" is another favorite and showcases Buck 65's talent for crafting beautiful, emotionally moving songs, being amongst some of his best of that category.One of my gripes with the album is the overuse of guest appearances. While a lot of the guest spots are used perfectly (such as on \"Cold Steel Drum\"), on other tracks Buck seems to be outshined by his collaborator, most notably on \"BCC,\" which seems like a track by John Southworth featuring Buck 65.All in all, however, the album is very solid and I would consider it up to be high up in the ranks with some of Buck 65's best albums, including Square (my personal favorite album of his) and Secret House Against the World.My Favorite Songs:  She Said Yes, Cold Steel Drum, Zombie Delight, Superstars Don't Love\n", "val": 0.012296784669160843}

{"text": "This song, like the whole Speed of Darkness album, is decent enough.  It's just not the Flogging Molly that we're used to.  On past albums, Flogging Molly told stories that cut to the core of the human experience.  While the stories were King's own, the themes were relatable to people of any nationality, any class, any generation. This album, in trying to be political and current, lost a lot of that.  The album stacks up competitively against other recent left-leaning working-class punk acts' albums (think of the Street Dogs), but it doesn't have the timeless, universal power that Flogging Molly brought to Swagger, Drunken Lullabies, Within a Mile of Home and (perhaps to a lesser extent) Float.I guess that, as decades pass, bands have to evolve with the lives of their members.  This was a respectable effort at that evolution, but I hope that FM tries a different approach on future work.\n", "val": 0.0009096454014070332}

The subject matter is depressing but the lyrics are hopeful and the music is energetic. If you don't listen to closely to what is being sung, this tune will put a smile on your face and set your toes a tapping. Flogging Molly is a socially and politically aware band that reminds me a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Midnight-Oil/dp/B000002C4D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Midnight Oil</a>, with both Irish and American roots.Their website goes into more depth about what&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Speed-Of-Darkness/dp/B004OZS03Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Speed Of Darkness</a>&nbsp;and the band is all about.

{"text": "Well I'm selecting 3 stars, against my better judgement. I am truly a huge fan of Falco. And this cd was great, but I am not happy with it. Due to reading the other reviews from others, I was under the assumption that this included a dvd. When I first ordered this I was tickled to find more video footage of this great musician. Then I received my package I was soooo excited and tore into like a little kid opening a present on Christmas day. After opening it, and realizing there was no bonus dvd included:-( Then when I inquired about my order, I was informed there was never a bonus dvd for the package, and that I should not pay any mind to the reviews. Now I'm confused because up til now I've always used the reviews to decide to purchase a product. Now it makes wonder if I order anything else, namely a product like this, how much will I get sent to me. Long live Falco, and hooray to everyone out there trying so hard to keep his memory alive, but now I just wonder how do I get that dvd that was mentioned in the other reviews. I love to change my reviews to 5 stars!\n", "val": 0.00011715056461980566}
{"text": "One of the quintessential must have cds of the 80s. Falco burst onto the american scene with Rock Me Amadeus, you couldn't turn the dial on the radio without bumping into this song or a variety of alternate versions/mixes.  Yes, back then, radios had dials. When I first heard Rock Me Amadeus, I loved the hook, and on the heels of the Amadeus movie that was just released it seemed oddly relvant that this song should hit. His earlier song \"Der Kommisar\" was released and was a hit when performormed by After the Fire. But there is something to be said for the imapact of those same lyrics recited in German. After this album came out, I searched out Falco's original version of Der Kommisar and have never looked back on the american remake. Following Rock Me Amadeus, was Vienna Calling, another smash dance hit on the American Top 40. To call Falco a one-hit-wonder woudl be to deminish his vast catalog of great music, as well as leave out the fact that he had two hits off this album alone. Had his version of Der Kommisar been released prior to After the Fire, I'm sure that would have hit big here too. Considering that Nena had a hit with 99 luftballoons (where everyone PREFERRED her German version over her remade american version) it isn't hard to see a german song making it big on the charts. Falco was a gifted performer. Had he been born here instead of Germany, with his love of American club music, R&B and of course rap and dance, he would have been a phenominal hit maker here in the States. However, born in Austria, he seemed a bit held back, perhaps it was still the stinted political climate, and the social opression of the era, but he was still able to make a huge splash just the same. He was huge there, and spilled over on to our shores. And I am grateful that he did. Every song here is a gem. Jeanny is a very poignant and emotional ballad, Macho Macho is a very hook driven track, and It's all Over Now Baby Blue is one of the best remakes of a Dylan song I've heard. Tango the Night is a great dance song, America is also a great little masterpiece in its own right. The 25th anniversary version of this album adds great remasterring to a sonic masterpiece. Every note and sound is crisp and clear, the mixes are fine, though I would have loved to hear one of the versions of Rock Me Amadeus that I remembered from one of the rock radio stations (I know it was available on vinyl at one time)The song Without You, is also a nice edition to the collection. The only problems I have with the edition is I would have loved it to include all the videos that were released for the cd. Not sure what the deluxe version has on the second disc. So I am not sure if this was included on that version or not. I would also reccoment that you find the dvd \"falco everything\" which has tons of videos and interviews (with english subtitles) Unfortunately it is in Pal format, so make sure your dvd player can play it before you purcahse it. Overall this is a great cd, very timeless, and enjoayble 25 years later (if not more so)\n", "val": 0.015071581117808819}
{"text": "Okay, I thought I'd swing by here and post my review of the Deluxe edition. I'm gonna skip over the first 10 songs because I've already reviewed the regular album.Let's move onto the special Jeanny remix. I have to admit I was horrified the first time I listened to the song. Jeanny is such a perfect song and I felt like the song was ruined. Give it a few more chances. The Jeanny mix is a grower. No, I don't like it as well as I like the original Jeanny. But I have to admit Hurts did a wonderful job with the song.Special mixes all sound fantastic and they're totally worth having imo.Okay, last but certainly not least is something I've been looking forward to. Whoever put together this cd/dvd combo, THANK YOU! I have to admit I get a tad bit irritated being a Falco fan because sometimes you have a product that's absolutely useless to somebody in another country. The other dvds are unplayable here because of region codes. The books are unreadable because I don't understand German. Yes, you read that right. I like Falco's music and I don't understand German. I realize demand for Falco products are probably pretty low unless you live in a place where Falco was very popular. So in a way I guess I do understand the companies skipping over the majority of the world. I just hope with the dvd in this set might be a wake up call for people that make Falco merchandise. Do the dvds and have codes so anybody can play them. Play them on Chinese dvd players, American dvd players, Japanese dvd players, etc.The dvd was playable. I couldn't get it to play on my Magnavox DVD recorder. I tried it on another player and I got it to play on that one. I had some difficulty with the player (not the disc) and I decided to play the disc on the computer. I enjoyed all of the content on the dvd. But I kinda get the feeling the content on the dvd might've been a 'been there and done that' thing for the Falco fans that have other Falco dvds. I'm not sure about that one. It's just a feeling I had.Anyway, if you're a Falco fan--you'll enjoy this version. I'd honestly just skip over the regular Falco 3 25th Anniversary cd and aim to get the Deluxe version. It's totally worth it.\n", "val": 4.3454401748022065e-05}
{"text": "This Anniversary Edition of \"Falco 3\" is a remastered re-release of Austria's most popular (and only) popstar. It was originally released in 1985 and reached #3 of the US Billboard Charts, still a remarkable feature for an album mostly sung in german.This Edition is the best release of this album:- all song have been remastered- it has the correct version of \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue (4:41 Minutes) instead of the version with the mastering error (5:08 Minutes)- it includes the remix/cover version by HURTS of the song \"Jeanny\"- it inlcudes the unreleased song \"Without You\" from the recording sessions anno 1985- it boast 4 original extended version from the 80 which have not been released on CD before:* Rock Me Amadeus\" (Extended Version) (7:07)* \"Vienna Calling\" (Tourist Version) (7:36)* \"Mnner Des Westens\" (Extended Version) (5:23)* \"Urban Tropical\" (Extended Version) (7:26)- the Deluxe-2CD-Version has an additional DVD with interviews from Falco, his manager, his producers, his video directors etc.) about the making of this album and several re-edits of his famous videos (there is even a new video for the SALIERI VERSION of \"Rock Me Amadeus\"), all with englisch/german subtitles- the Deluxe-2CD-Version also has an extended booklet which commentaries from his producers about the making of almost every song on this album (with an englisch translation!)Of course, the Anniversary Edition is not perfect:- the booklet doesn't include the lyrics- the DVD doesn't include the original videos, just newly cut re-edits- the remix/cover version by HURTS is below average - they go for a mix between a remix and a cover version, they even sing the verses in german - with little effect. a remix (like the one for Rammstein) would have been better- you don't find all of the many remixes from this album there: the classic Salieri Version of \"Rock Me Amadeus\" is missing (although you find this version on the DVD), also the Extended Version of \"Jeanny\" is not included (neither in german nor in its english version).You could also argue, that it would have been nice to have the single version of \"Urban Tropical\" too and also the Rough Mix of \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" rather than the not so interesting DVD content\"Falco 3\" is Falco's most sucessful album (not his best - that would have to be \"Einzelhaft\"). It features the singles \"Rock Me Amadeus\" (a UK and US Number 1), \"Vienna Calling\" and \"Jeanny\". Nowaday it sounds wonderfully 80s and still is as much fun as 25 years ago. The Anniversary Edition sounds brilliant, the bonus extended versions are a nostalgic look back to the heydays of the 12inch format and the additional DVD offers some news for people not so familiar with falcos carrer.\n", "val": 0.00011285002256045118}

{"text": "I am thrilled with this release, though I would be even happier if they would finally release their double-CD of remixes from the 80s.  Then again, I would like to have \"Youthquake\" and \"Mad, Bad & Dangerous to Know\" re-mastered and re-released with bonus tracks and remixes, and new artwork and liner notes.  I can dream... until then, this collection nicely covers all the big hits on Sony, all of which I love EXCEPT the cringeworthy \"Turn Around and Count 2 10\".  \"Baby Don't Say Goodbye\" or better yet, the Glam mix of \"Sex Drive\" or the fabulous missed-single opportunity \"Nukleopatra\" would have been a more fitting addition.  None-the-less, this is good bare bones stuff, with some of the great remixes on CD for the first time.  My only real complaint (other than the sound quality, which is a bit, well... \"off\") is that version of \"Hooked on Love\" was not the single version.  I wish that version was on this release... the one that was on the awful \"Evolution\".  Kudos for FINALLY releasing the 7\" single version of \"Brand New Lover\" on CD.  I have been searching for that nugget for years!  Much obliged!If you were a huge fan of DOA in the 80s like I was (I even got to see them in concert in 1987, and touch Pete's hand) then this collection should satisfy your appetite.  I prefer to close my eyes, listen to some of the great songs which STILL sound just as amazing today as they did in their hey-day, and revel in the music.  Of course, it also helps to picture Pete Burns as he looked back in the 80s... a hot GOD!Enjoy... get this CD or download from Amazon!\n", "val": 0.012731172144412994}
{"text": "I'm glad to finally have the radio edits of some of these tracks, most of which were seemingly only available on vinyl 45's in the 1980's, such as \"Something in My House,\" which was an extended version on the MBDTK album, and in remixed versions on \"Rip It Up,\" the 2-disc \"Evolution,\" the \"Fragile\" album, and the \"Unbreakable\" remix album.In reference to one comment here that talks about wanting reissues of the two SAW albums and \"their final album would also be a treat,\" which I assume is a reference to \"Nude,\" though some may only be familiar with their four albums from the 1980's, DOA has actually released seven studio albums and two mix albums:Sophisticated Boom Boom (1984)Youthquake (1985)Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (1987)Rip It Up (1987 - remix album)Nude (1989)Fan the Flame (1990 - Japan only)Nukleopatra (1995)Fragile (2000 - five new songs, some remixes of past hits; Japan only)Unbreakable (2001 - remix album, Japan only)A new album was announced for release last year (2010), but there seems to be a lot of drama in Pete Burns' life, so who knows if it will ever be released. He did release one solo track, \"Never Marry An Icon,\" but it's sort of a different style than the traditional DOA. Far too much auto-tune for my taste. Pete has such a great natural voice, I was disappointed.\n", "val": 7.780019222991541e-05}
{"text": "This is a best of collection to have if you are open-minded to enjoying 80's style party music. I was pleasantly suprised to hear alot of strong tracks that compared to the classic \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\". My favorite song in this collection happens to be \"Come Home With Me Baby\". The title makes it obvious, and it happens to be a fun song about just wanting a good time with someone. I admit that I just received the collection today, and have already played \"Come Home With Me Baby\" three times. \"Hooked on Love\", and \"Lover Come Back to Me\" (extended remix) are pretty enjoyable tracks. \"That's the Way I Like it\" is a creative spin on the classic by KC and the Sunshine Band. I honestly prefer the version by KC and the Sunshine Band. However, the version of \"That's the Way I Like it\" by Dead or Alive is still enjoyable to listen to. I took a chance on purchasing this collection because I love the song \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\", and I am satisfied that I did. For this reason, I recommend this collection if you enjoy the above mentioned song.\n", "val": 0.05186103656888008}
{"text": "The sound quality is definitely debatable - some tracks sound a bit harsh. It's over compressed to be sure, but listenable. However, the major flaws here are that both versions of \"Lover Come Back To Me\" and \"Brand New Lover\" are pitched incorrectly (they're slightly slow). This is unforgivable. If you visit the Sony Music Entertainment website, you'll find no email address to contact the company (I guess they're not interested in feedback - positive or negative). Sure, it's a dirt cheap compilation, but I would have paid twice the price for a properly mastered product. \"Youthquake\" and \"Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know\" are overdue for reissue - perhaps the mistakes here can be corrected then.\n", "val": 6.401799328159541e-05}
{"text": "DEAD OR ALIVE'S THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE IT best of is a stellar collection of their 80's efforts to keep us clamoring for Pete Burns's vocal and visual hystreonics interwoven in some of the most pulsating high-energy music of that time. The songs are culled from the the albums SOPHISTICATED BOOM BOOM*,YOUTHQUAKE*, MAD, BAD, and DANGEROUS TO KNOW*, and NUDE*. You won't find any tunes from FAN THE FLAME (PART I)*, NUKLEOPATRA*, or FRAGILE*. This bargain CD is great for the money (currently under $10.00 bucks!) and also has four extended remixes! Two of them are worth the price of the disc alone, and to the best of my knowledge are the first time ever out on compact disc format; that would be the fantastically campy \"Mortevicar Mix\" of SOMTHING IN MY HOUSE, and the brilliantlly classic \"Murder Mix\" of YOU SPIN ME ROUND (LIKE A RECORD). The deluxe format of the bands EVOLUTION greatest hits compilation lists the extended version of YSMR as the \"MM\", but this is an error - so these awesome rare versions along with the fourteen other tracks make this particular collection one I recommend for the casual listener or the newbe listener just beginning their DOA experience.. The two killer extended tracked are for the long time fans who can now orgasmically own these two wonders finally on CD format. The only down side for me to this disc is that some of these tracks are just too short, and I really do prefer some of the longer variations of them; yet being a long time fan I think these radio editions will most likely please the average 80's fan. What pleasantly shocked me was a version of TURN AROUN AND COUNT TO TEN which I had never heard before! I thought I had heard everything these guys had recorded over the years and now I own it with this collection! - *** - The first decade of the 21st Century hasn't seen Pete/Dead or Alive do alot of recording. Yes FRAGILE came out in 2000 (half new tracks, half remixes), and there was that hypnotic Pet Shop Boys produced single JACK AND JILL PARTY several years after that. MR BURNS has been doing alot of reality shows in Britian and has unfortunately is now more known for his ongoing facial transformations with plastic surgery. In the last month he has released a solo single entitled NEVER MARRY AN ICON. Let's hope Pete goes back to singing full time, because when I look at his back cataloge he has kept so many of us \"spinning\" for so long now.\n", "val": 0.0013014867436140776}
{"text": "A couple of years ago, a much needed 2-disc Japanese Import CD of pretty much EVERY Dead or Alive 12\" mix was planned but was scrapped at the last minute. And so many long time fans waiting to have all the other DOA 12\" mixes aside from You Spin Me Round on CD were left with nothing. However, a good majority of their 12\" mixes have actually appeared on CD in one way or another in the past decade, be it on compilations like the hi-bias Retro Active series or various versions of Dead or Alive albums and compilations. Still, there are a handful of mixes that are not yet on CD.This compilation fixes that a bit--a very little bit if you've been collecting along the way. This CD is most notable for numerous 7\" mixes of their singles, but the disc closes with four 12\" mixes. The Mortevicar Mix of \"Something in My House\" is reason enough to buy this inexpensive collection. I have been waiting over 20 years to have this mix on CD. It is my favorite version of the song and features sound samples from the movie The Exorcist. Also crucial is the full American Wipe out mix of My Heart Goes Bang. This mix was on one of the import 2-disc versions of \"Evolution\" a few years back, but faded 15 seconds early. Here, you get the full length. \"Lover Come Back to Me\" is featured in the U.S. 12\" mix, which is different than the European remix (and I personally prefer the U.S. mix, although they are both really good). And finally, You Spin Me Round is here in its glorious full length Murder Mix, which has become harder to obtain on CD since many CDs that featured this version are now out of print, and others tend to list this version when what they actually feature is the Performance Mix (which I think is an inferior club mix).As for the singles and single mixes, this collection does an excellent job of representing all four of the band's albums from the 80s. But really, what fans want is ALL their 12\" mixes instead of a compilation featuring SOME tracks that haven't been on CD before and then a bunch of songs we already have.After the amazing reissue of DOA's album \"Sophisticated Boom Boom\" with essentially all that album's 12\" mixes as bonus tracks, it's frustrating that DOA's two biggest albums produced by Stock Aitken Waterman have not been reissued with all the 12\" mixes as bonus tracks. And of course, their final album would be a treat as well from the 80s even though it wasn't SAW produced. Fans have been waiting to see 12\" mixes of In Too Deep, I'll Save You All My Kisses, Hooked on Love, and Baby Don't Say Goodbye to finally make their way to CD, and it just hasn't happened yet. But at least you'll be able to cross a few more of their 12\" mixes off your list of stuff to get on CD with this release.Just one note about the sound quality. The mastering is very clean (sounds like all original masters, no vinyl sourcing), but the mix tends to be a little shrill, lacking sufficient lows. Unless you have an old school 2-channel stereo system with a graphic equalizer (the way music should be heard), you may find this one a little hard on the ears on a modern surround system, ipod or computer with presets equalizer choices.\n", "val": 0.0003417733241803944}

But given the original mastering of the tracks on this disc it is not  surprising that they are treble heavy. Treble was the in thing in the 80's. But to say that these tracks sound horrible is an overstatement. I played this cd on a stereo with a subwoofer which filled in the sound quite well. I can only suspect that those complaining about the sound used a cheap stereo. A good stereo will have a good subwoofer to fill in the low end.I especially love the remixes of the songs especially There is Something in My House (Mortevicar Mix). That is worth the price of admission alone. My other favorite remix on this collection is You Spin Me Round (Like A Record) (Murder Mix). This remix clocks in at 8 minutes! If you like the drumming on this song, you have to get this as it really shines on this one.By the way, I also have the Evolution greatest hits collection. Although that one has a better remastering, the tracks are lacking on that one. They are pretty boring as far as the mixes. That's The Way I Like It blows that one away with its selections.

{"text": "I'm a huge Dead or Alive fan, so when I saw the tracklist for this album, I thought it would be a great buy.  Well, even though the tracklisting LOOKS good, the way it sounds is anything but good.  The sound quality is terrible.  There is no reason why in 2010 (when this album complication was compiled) with all of the high-tech sound mastering equipment out there that the songs could not have been remastered.  The sound quality is very thin and hardly any bass or \"bump\" heard.  The other problem with the songs is the versions of the songs (with the exceptions of a few long remixes) are way too short.  In fact, several of the songs are even shorter than the radio versions that were played on radio when the songs were originally released.  These versions are very short, stripped down, and generic.  Even the album \"booklet\" is generic and plain and just a piece of paper folded in half.The only plus for me is that I got the 7\" version of Turn Around And Count 2 10, which I haven't been able to get until now.I guess this album is OK for the casual fan, but even then you don't get to hear the songs at their best the way they should be heard.  I would personally suggest putting together your own greatest hits collection and buying the ALBUM VERSIONS of the songs on MP3 so you can get better quality and length.  This collection just does not do the songs justice.\n", "val": 1.8017248294199817e-05}
{"text": "I am only slightly aware of Justin Bieber's trajectory, but his recent comments on various social issues caught my attention. On several issues he seemed to have somewhat confused takes on things, leaving people to wonder what he meant. But on the matter of a woman being raped and then becoming pregnant which she then sought to terminate, he was unequivocal. Justin Bieber stated: \"Everything happens for a reason.\" This was his way of explaining why he thought it was wrong for the woman to seek termination. Well, the bizarre theology which apparently this kid has been raised with is not the first issue. Even though it sounds more like pagan fatalism than any sort of Christianity. But that begs the question, which is closely related to the only point that really matters here: Are we now even beyond the idiot culture? Have we moved even a step further into the quicksand. Is our cultural vacancy now to be assumed  as pregnant with potential philosophy???  This can be shown phenomenologically by the fact that comparable stars of the past  like Leif Garret were not asked for their philosophical reflection. But now the modern equivalent, Justin Bieber, is. I think Justin Bieber should quit philosophizing  and reflect rather on practical maters like  whether he will be wearing a bandana on his head in future as faded star Leif Garret does now: Vanitas vanitatum!\n", "val": 5.696208609151654e-05}

{"text": "My old friend from the 1960s great American hitchhike highway, Peter Paul Markin (then consciously carrying the moniker of Be-Bop Benny), really was the first person who tuned me into the world of blues, old time country blues (driven by the Saturday juke joints), and the later post-World War II electrification of the blues as blacks headed north to the cities- and electricity. He got me, a small city Maine boy, hip to the likes of Son House, Skip James, Bessie Smith, Memphis Minnie, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. All unabashedly raw talent, and all out front down deep blues, country or city.Of course that was over forty years ago and almost all of those who he hipped me too have now passed on, although not their musical influence and that is what brings me to this review, Alligator Records: 40th Anniversary Collection 2 CD set. Since the blues are still very much with us, although that genre, like rock and roll, has it up and down periods of popularity it is necessary to take a peek at who has carried on the traditions that Be-Bop Benny started me out on when we travelled those West Coast highways seeking the great American West night.And that is where the Alligator Record label comes in. In earlier times certain record companies were known, and well-known, for certain kinds of music. Chess Record sin Chicago comes readily to for electric blues. As does Sun Records for early rock (and rockabilly). And Vanguard Records for folk stuff. Well Alligator has filled a certain niche for those who wished to carry on the electric blues tradition and this 38 performance collection set is testimony to those efforts for the last forty -something years.While they may have recoded for other recoding companies or had other label arrangements (not uncommon in the helter-skelter world of record production) the artists list here constitute something  of \"who's who\" of post-1960s electric blues. A small roll call of names like Koko Taylor, Albert Collins, Guitar Shorty, Marcia Ball, Son Seal, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Johnny Winter, Lonnie Brooks, Hound Dog Taylor, James Cotton and the rest make my case. The only question that I have is who will produce the next generation of blues material?  Alligator Records efforts here are the new benchmark.\n", "val": 0.0016315492102876306}

The Queen of the Blues, Koko Taylor, dishes out traditional, electric blues with commanding sass while her throaty vocals roar.If you want to know what pure Chicago Blues sounds like then listen to the aggressive music of Son Seals. Lonnie Brooks' booming voice, sassy guitar, and enthusiastic rhythms are as fulfilling as a bowl of gumbo. Like a spontaneous, wild party thrown by your College roommate, Hound Dog Taylor creates a welcome racket that you can't resist joining. Two of America's roadhouse kingpins - Roy Buchanan and Delbert McClinton - create the definitive version of a Willie Dixon standard. New Orleans piano master, Professor Longhair, creates a party out of the great Louisiana pastime of cooking. Albert Collins and guests are represented via a track from the best-selling disc Showdown! Alligator's varied roster of remarkable artists isn't bursting with acoustic performers, yet Buddy Guy and Junior Wells prove acoustic blues can be rejuvenating. Although there was no room in the liner to list all the impressive sidemen on these sessions, they include: Billy Branch, Johnny B. Moore, Sammy Lawhorn, Pinetop Perkins, Abb Locke, Johnny B. Gayden, Ken Saydak, and countless others.Driven with a fervent passion for music and using the same hard work ethic as its artists, Alligator Records has begun the careers of new stars e.g., Corey Harris, rescued the careers of existing stars e.g., Lonnie Mack, and ensured the careers of living legends e.g., James Cotton, continue to evolve. This collective body of works celebrates the legacy of their \"Genuine Houserockin' Music\" artists.Tim Holek\n", "val": 0.01357551384717226}

{"text": "It seems like Mr. Bieb's demographics are mainly pre-teen girls and senior citizens? I was 67 when I discovered that I actually enjoyed listening to his ear-candy. I find his stuff very pleasant and relaxing; no urges to jump up and down and dance around and tousle his hair, though. I can see why he's considered a joke by serious musicians and their fans, but I have to say that he's definitely mastered his craft and delivers his listener's money's-worth on every cut I've ever heard. I really like the crisp production style used in producing this album. His earlier stuff was often overproduced and his voice was often lost to us, buried in layers of BS effects. I like the increased richness and depth in his voice now that he's picking up some huskiness. If you compare the cuts on this album with the same songs from earlier kiddie-star tracks, the increase in musical quality is distinct! I doubt that I'll be buying any of his DVD's, but he's definitely a good listen.I hope the 'star system' doesn't destroy him. It would be nice if he could hang onto the values and joys that got him started, and become one of our lasting musical treasures.\n", "val": 0.018702758476138115}

I decided to get this album because I was interested in finding out why everyone liked this kid and what all the hype is about but couldn't stand his original My Worlds albums. To be honest, his voice is still a little young for me and I am hoping it will drop a little lower with age, but I really enjoyed the acoustic sound of this album.  I also find it refreshing to be able to hear his voice more clearly without all the production and loud instrumentation.  He has a good voice that hasn't had to be corrected through too much Auto-tuning.  I found his lyrics endearing and very age appropriate.  A sweet album. I particularly liked the Prayer song and the Down to Earth songs. They showcased a glimpse into future depth and a musical style that maybe he will grow into as he matures. I look forward to watching Justin grow as an artist and to see what will come of this young man. I am going to keep him on my radar. He is evidently very talented and I don't want to write him off just because he's young. Maybe his future albums will appeal to me more. But it's a good start.

I play background music  in my school library all the time, and this one works fine, except for a  few more energetic cuts.

I rank this and `Standing in My Shoes' as the best of his recordings in the last ten or so years.On `6&12 String', he blew you away with speed and power, a falling-down-the-hill-head-over-heels kind of sound.  On `OGNV'. Leo reinvented his style of playing.  It may be a slower, more mature style, but he replaces the speed and power with finesse and intricate fingerpicking.Each piece evokes a mood, whether it be a romantic walk in the woods on a cool autumn day (Three/Quarter North), whimsicality (Snorkel), instrumental storytelling (Morning is a Long way Home), or  several versions of one melody(Accordion Bells).Veteran Kottke fans will appreciate Leo's `riff recycling', a thing he typically does in his music. In `Snorkel` a bit of `Mona Ray' (Dreams and All that Stuff )leaks in.  Leo gives us a new acoustic version of `Morning is a Long Way Home' (`Ice Water'). I even think I might have heard a bit of `Monkey Lust' (`Mudlark') drifting through `Too Fast'.\n", "val": 0.003700490575283766}

The themes in the music are fully fleshed out in each song, giving each one a unique personality.  It fits many moods and even without the vocals, it does seem like the songs are saying something, much like a classical or jazz piece.

It feels like a natural evolution from The Heart of Everything. Besides that, Within Temptation has stated that every song on their album sounds different from the other, and early reviews seem to indicate this.

{"text": "Since buying this CD three days ago, I've listened to it over and over again.  It is a rich amalgam of many Latin rhythms - from traditional Andean to the Cuban guaguanco - and performed by a Costa Rican group I've  never heard of before but who are obviously gifted musicians.  Blades is  brilliant and this work displays his range.  It is a radical departure from  his usual upbeat, sardonic works of the past.  I thought after \"La  Rosa de los Vientos\", we'd see another exploration of Panamanian  talent and culture (which was very well done and itself a new direction for  him).  Instead, he has broadened his musicality even beyond what I thought  was possible.  He describes this as a \"reflective and melancholic  work\" and defends it as a true non-commercial piece of which he's  justifiably proud.  Anyone who enjoys Ruben's music should have this CD as  part of their collection to join him on his emotional musical odyssey.  Bien hecho Rubencito.\n", "val": 0.029235271736979485}

I compose music for a living, and most CDs quickly bore me, but I cried listening to this one.  The concept,  production quality, arrangements, and musicianship are absolutely stunning,  the lyrics riveting, and the music composition literally takes my breath  away.  I wish I could compare it to something just to describe it, but it  feels as though an entirely new form and style of music altogether have  been invented with this album.  I'm a HUGE Ruben Blades fan -- musically,  lyrically, politically, and in terms of what he does socially in the world  to advance the human spirit.  I own nearly thirty of his albums, all of  which inspire me.  But I've never heard *anything* as beautiful (or as  musically complex) as the songs on this album.  It transcends, although it  doesn't lessen in the least, all of his previous work.  If you're ready to  take a ride upward to a whole new level, buy this album!  I perceive it to  be my favorite album of all time, his crowning achievement, and one of the  most significant works of music ever produced in any genre.  Abrazos,  Ruben!!!\n", "val": 0.04167065769433975}

Even my father-in-law, a famous classical music figure (who speaks about two words of Spanish) instantly fell in love with the music and voice on this album.Sadly, for those of us who are Spanish-handicapped, there are no English translations for the songs, but trust me, the lyrics are reason enough to learn some Spanish. In fact, the song \"Vida\" was my first introduction to Ruben Blades, a lesson in a Spanish class I took. And, as I have learned, it is a quintessentially \"Rubenesque\" song, blending emotionally moving lyrics with physically moving music.The title song \"Tiempos\" is also genius without parellel. One has no other desire than to dance to this song of times to laugh, to cry, to die and to be born. To hell with the depressing songs of Euro deep thinking, we can all think deeply and still want to live and carry on and do something better with our lives when we listen to and take to heart what Ruben sings to us.\n", "val": 0.02316160686314106}

The violin can be a haunting sound. Even if some of this new music reminds some of 'new age' the power of it cannot be denied. We all evolve as we grow older and the events in our lives sometimes change us forever. It seems that is what has occured on this album for Ruben and the rest of us. Since that concert, I listen to Tiempos daily. I still hear it anew almost every time. I look forward to Mr Blades next music, what ever it is. Gracias hermano.\n", "val": 0.01796548441052437}
{"text": "This intentionally non-commercial effort by Blades is a cultural melting  pot of various richly textured Latin Sounds. Blades combines both different  musical styles as well as Latin genres to create a subtle and soothing  experience. Yet, it is in this sweet subtlety that which lies the  magnificent power of the meaning behind this album ! He has taken  Panamanian,Cuban,Spanish, Mexican styles of music along with other Central  and South American influences to paint into a canvas of cultural color. As  for genres, he uses classical,folklorico,and contemporary styles. Much of  his usual Salsa expertise is a bit muted or finely woven into the  background of some tracks. The instrumentation is also varied:  violin,classical/acoustic guitar, congas, timbales, maracas, tenor sax.  The lyrics are non-ambiguous; They have deep political,social and cultural  substance with direct meaning. This c.d. is also very introspective. To say  this project is about life in general would be an ambiguous assumption in  itself.  The photo cover of Ruben Blades looking pensively into the sky  is also an indication that this is the thinking music collector's album who  wants to be thoughtfully moved as well. Truly a recording from the  heart,mind and soul. In the preface or foreward notes Blades states in  Spanish... that to limit his (or one's)creative potential can prove to be  artistically suicidal. This pretty much sums up why this project does not  follow the typical commercialized format...\n", "val": 0.012661200016736984}
{"text": "If you are looking for the young, get-up-and-dance, racous, tongue-on-your cheek Ruben Blades, you will be better off purchasing one of his earlier releases.  If you search, however, for the mature Ruben, the one that still  loves his native Panama and his Continent but who is now willing to be more  creative with the combination of sounds, you must buy \"Tiempos\"  today!Since every cut of this album has its own personality, I believe  that the best achievement of Ruben and his team has been to keep it all  together, with a sense of unity.The opening track \"Mar del  Sur\" (refering to the Pacific Ocean) sets the mood.  Without words it  \"talks\" about struggles, love, adventure, humidity.On the  other hand you may be, as I was, initially shocked by his observations on  the realities and violence of urban life and drug-dealership on  \"Sicarios\". After a while, though, you will come to realize that  he is only telling it like it is - and he is using a magnificent  arrangement at it!Partly responsible for the special sound of  \"Tiempos\" is the Costa-Rican group, EDITUS, which gives Ruben's  music and words a profound soulfulness and provide it with the different  kind of sound that most people forget when they talk about Latin  music.\"Tiempos\" will speak to your heart, make you think, get  you angry, and help you remember loved ones who are no longer with you.It is so rewarding to see an artist remain active in the spotlight and  still be honest and reflective with his music that I am compelled to call  \"Tiempos\" the \"best album\" from Ruben Blades ever.  However, I know that when it comes to Ruben we may as well be saying the  exact same thing after he releases his next production.  I can't wait!\n", "val": 0.044340528547763824}

The lyrics are clever and inventive enough that they'd be enjoyable without music and the songs are catchy enough that they'd be enjoyable without the words, but combined they make unstoppably catchy songs that make it a great album.

As silly as Tim Minchin, but without the introspection.This album is the most consistent album in the genre I've ever heard, favorites include \"You, Me and Steve\", \"This Party Took a Turn...\", \"Pregnant Women are Smug\", and \"F--- You\" (which is unrelated to the Cee-Lo song of the same name), but there's not a single track on the album I have an urge to skip, quite a rare thing.

Be aware, if you're like me and think you're getting 'all' you got back in the day from the album.\n", "val": 0.0006583764334209263}

You're going to hear about this band very soon, if you haven't already.A Silent Film obviously have varied influences that form their sound, but the music seems very accessible. If you like older Keane and Coldplay, you'll appreciate the way the band incorporates the use of piano.  Too many bands either skip the piano, or can't use it effectively, especially in songs with fast & changing tempos.  Not a problem here.  In terms of overall sounds, the album is like a cocktail with bits of influence from Stereophonics, The Killers, and even Muse at times - and yes, that is all a very good thing.  The songs have nice texture to them, and it becomes obvious that while the band may not be going full-on for anthems to fill arenas, their songs have enough layers to rise above much of the junk being played on \"alternative\" stations today.  There is a nice mix of falsetto singing with straightforward choruses - the vocals sound very clean here.  Besides \"Mark\", other solid tracks include \"Julie June\" and \"Sleeping Pills\".Originally, the only thing I thought that might have made the album more complete would have been a little more variety.  Most of the songs are faster-paced and obviously share similar ideas musically.  Then the album ended with \"Aurora\" - stripped down surprise that made me appreciate the album as a whole even more.\n", "val": 0.014062748290598392}

{"text": "I knew next to nothing about Greg Dulli or his music prior to listening to the newest album from The Twilight Singers.  I had heard of the Afghan Whigs but that was about it.  I listened to Dynamite Steps after my brother reccommended it.  It just goes to show  that sometimes the best music hits you when you least expect it to.  Upon my first listen to this album, I was struck by the strangeness of it all.  The songs were dark, moody, emotionally heavy and they were never in a hurry to be over.  They created an indelible atmosphere that was quite unlike anything I'd recently heard.  The songs were lacking in hooks or catchy choruses and Greg Dulli's vocals reminded me of a mix of Richard Ashcroft, Mark Everett (E) and Randy Newman.  Sounds bizarre, but it worked.  I can't say that I loved the album upon first listen, but I was definitely intrigued.The genius of Dynamite Steps, however, lies in its complexity and layers.  Repeat listens to this album reveal new facets and nuances in the lyrics, arrangements, and in Dulli's vocals as well.  This is truly an ablum in the purest sense of the term.  There is a remarkable cohesiveness as the songs seem to flow endlessly into one another.  Sometimes the album feels more like one continuous song more than it does a series of individual tracks.  That will likely keep The Twilight Singers from scoring much radio play, but something tells me they're ok with that.  So am I.\n", "val": 0.011656981892883778}
{"text": "I'll admit I have a love/hate relationship with Dulli's music, which I have been listening to since his days leading the Afghan Whigs.  His songs have a visceral effect on me: some of them truly move me, others absolutely irritate me.  That said, I believe that Dulli is one of the best American singer/songwriters of the moment, and right now he is clearly at his peak in creativity.As another reviewer stated, the two Gutter Twins CDs are amazing, and have been on my play list almost non-stop since they were released.  On the other hand, The Twilight Singers CDs I have tended to pick and choose from, making my own play lists.  Again, some of the songs I have loved, others I really have not liked at all.All of this by way of saying that, if you have been following the Twilight Singers for the last few years, then you should really enjoy this CD.  In my opinion, it is probably the most consistent CD they have made.  From start to finish, there is not a bad song on the CD.  And while I tend to like Lanegan's vocals more than Dulli's (Lanegan does sing backup on at least one song), here Dulli holds his own.This CD is not as mellow as some have been; indeed, a couple of tracks reminded me of the Afghan Whigs, but smoother, more polished.  It has a rock-blues sound to it, of course, but with just the right effects.I don't know enough about music to speak to what he is doing technically in terms of the construction of the songs, so I'll leave that to others who are better qualified.  I will say this: if you liked the Afghan Whigs, earlier Twilight Singers CDs, or The Gutter Twins project, then you can download this CD with confidence.  It is Dulli at his best, and my hope is that he will maintain this level of virtuosity for years to come.\n", "val": 0.023034971207380295}
{"text": "When I first really got into Greg Dulli's music was when i bought the gutter twins record Saturnalia on the count of Mark Lanegan. As I listened to that album I found that the songs that struck me the most were the ones that Dulli penned and sang on (God's Children, The Body). I decided to delve deeper and buy Powder Burns and Blackberry Belle. Both of these albums I would rank as my favorite records and i truly did not believe that they could be topped (especially Blackberry Belle, as an album it just flows so well!) Indeed I was wrong.This album has not only exceeded my expectations but it has me rethinking which Twilight Singers album I like most. I'd say it surpasses Powder Burns but is on par with Blackberry Belle.'Last Stop This Town' is a grower, and really reminds of 'Martin Eden' with its piano intro followed by its pulsating bass. The first time I heard it, i was unsure of what i was in for.'Be Invited' is more subtle in its approach but is in my opinion quite effective. With Lanegan doing guest vocals in the chorus, it really adds to the dark feeling that Dulli captures so well.'Waves' sounds so colossal in its delivery and guitar wise, really remind me of Dulli's days with The Afghan Whigs. His vocals seem buried but you can tell he's yelling his heart out on this one!'Get Lucky' is a sweet ballad that brings the mood back down. Lyrically it seems like a warning to those around the protagonist and as the song goes along it builds until you hear distorted applause. Quite deserving indeed.'On The Corner' is a really cool track! Dulli's lyrics were as he said more based on flow for this one more instead of creating a narrative. Dynamically the song is just fantastic.'Gunshots' is a really gripping emotive song that has a great hook to it. As the song builds the backing vocals from Joseph Arthur kick in, and they're just fantastic! They really add to the songs emotional qualities. I can see this going off live!'She was stolen' seems more anthemic than anything else on the record. Dulli said this song was quick to finish in the studio and it adds a nice touch to the record because it seems quite different to many of the other songs on the album. While the record has a dark vibe throughout, this seems like the first ray of light. A really charming, beautiful song.'Blackbird and the fox' brings the darkness back. Well before the album was even heard, Dulli said in an interview that the next record would have a 70's AM radio vibe to it. About 7 months later this song was released for free on their website. From the first couple of bars of the song I could tell Dulli was obviously having a bit of fun during that interview. Ani DiFranco duets on this song and the harmonies created together work beautifully! As it starts to really build the song's over. Quite a quick blast of brilliance!'Never Seen No Devil' begins in a reserved manner with Dulli singing softly but as the second verse rolls around, the song amps up and turns into another amazing song! I must say this is one of my favorites.'The Beginning of the End' begins like a shoegaze song and then cuts to just acoustic guitar. It's a really cool song, with Dulli using more of his higher register. i found it the most surprising when I first heard it. I now really do adore this song.'Dynamite Steps' is a great way to end a great album. It starts off slowly and drawn out but begins to shift dynamically as more layers are added. When the lead guitar line enters, it sounds just amazing. Dulli's lyrics are also quite touching and powerful as the song fades out.Now to be honest, this album doesn't stray too far from the sound The Twilight Singers are known for. It is cinematic in approach and has plenty of crescendos. Having said that this is the album I wanted them to create, something that had differing layers and certain songs which would take time to grow with but a sound which was ultimately familiar. If you like any of the Twilight Singers stuff, especially Blackberry Belle, then you should adore this album as I do. It deserves high praise and I hope this finally gives Greg Dulli the mainstream attention he deserves.\n", "val": 0.011077660135924816}

{"text": "I really liked what I've heard from Wye Oak, but I must admit to being put off by the grungy repetitive nature of `Holy Holy', a song that doesn't quite carry the same modern edge her other material does.  The repetitive nature of the \"Holy Holy Holy\" gets old and the fact that it is wedged between nearly every other statement (and yes, the fact that they are statements) makes this rather underwhelming.  I really wanted something better from Wye Oak.  Even when she changes up her \"Holy\" with \"Hold Me\" it isn't really clever enough to validate appreciation.  I love her voice and the way that she creates complete moods with her music, but there is nothing modern or wholly impressive about this track.  She sounds older than she is and the whole track comes off a tad underdeveloped.  It isn't terrible (the ending bridge/chorus explosion is perfect) but it lacks a true spark needed to make it stand out.I love me some Oak, so I'll be listening to more from her for sure; I just wish that this was a clearer representation of what she's capable of.\n", "val": 2.6603527658153325e-05}

Wye Oak will not disappoint you. Definitely worth a listen. By the way, the backup guitarist for Yo La Tengo needs to quit that band and go out on his own. If he ever reads this review, I hope he knows that we all thought he was great. The lead guitarist of Yo La Tengo was all hype and was an embarrassing showboat.

It's not too intense and not too mellow - it's great for working and it's great for parties.This is definitely within the top 3 of my favorite Mark Farina albums. There's only one track on here that I don't care much for (track 8) on Mushroom Jazz 7 vs. usually anywhere from 2-5 on most of his other albums that I don't care for. He actually introduces a lot of mushroom 'references' in this album - quotes and clips of people talking about mushrooms - as in the psychedelic mushrooms, just so you know. I think it's fabulous and it doesn't bother me whatsoever, but some people might be a bit up-tight about it.

{"text": "I got Music for Movement and Imagination about a year ago and it is played daily in mine and my nephew's house. None of the children are ballet dancers, but as far as kids are concerned music is music, it's that simple. We play this album quietly in the background as my children get ready for school in the morning and my oldest is 12! They enjoy the happy music that gets them going as they eat breakfast and pack their bags. My nephew, who is 3, has loved this album since I started playing it when he would come here. I got him his own CD for his house and its his favorite music at home and in the car. When 'Royal Banquet' comes on he pretends to conduct and march around like he's in a band! Schoolyard and Walk & Bounce are another couple of his favorites that he likes to move to. Don't let the names of these songs discourage you from downloading the album, ALL kids love this music and don't remember the names of the songs anyway! They remember the melodies and how the music makes them feel. We have several of Mr. Maddock's albums and when this album plays all you see on the faces of the children is pure joy.

If this is what you're looking for, that's wonderful, but if you want to hear jazz takes on Disney songs, you're going to have to listen very hard to this CD to find them. Creative piano work is all well and good, but I did not buy this CD to hear creative piano work; I bought it to hear jazz versions of some of my old favorite Disney songs. I heard jazz versions of \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Gaston\", and \"It's A Small World\", and several instrumental tracks that shared names with Disney songs and occasionally sounded something like the songs they were named after. What really baffles me is how such unlikely tracks as \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Gaston\" actually worked, and such obvious tracks as \"Bare Necessities\" and the title track did not, so very badly. \"Bare Necessities\" was a stunning disappointment - it seems like it would be impossible to do a jazz version of that song wrong, but it sounds like the musicians were playing jazz first and foremost, and had to be reminded (and weren't reminded often enough) that the end result had to sound at least kind of like the original \"Bare Necessities\". Aside from the previously named tracks, most of the album is like this.In short: As plain old jazz, it works. As background music, it works. As jazz versions of Disney songs, it does not work.\n", "val": 6.186797691043466e-05}

The arrangement by Spalding of Chim-Chim Cher-ee is extraordinary, and Alfredo Rodriques does some creative piano work on the Bare Necessities. We also hear the guitars of Kurt Rosenwinkel and Gilad Hekselman. The title says \"Vol. 1\"; will there be a Volume 2? These musicians did record other tunes to take advantage of this unique opportunity (Brubeck recorded a total of four); hence, if sales warrant, there should indeed be a follow-up album. So, spread the word!

{"text": "Once again found &  bought this CD at a thrift store. \"Someone didn't like it but I do.\" Some of the negative reviews expressed that they can't hear the Disney themes in these Jazz renditions but that's the point with \"Real Creativity\". Why would you want to hear the same thing all the time as I listen to the car next to me blasting & thumping out his RAP music. Classical music at times took folk music & set it to theme-mantic form. Jazz starts with the main theme, in this case a Disney tune, & free forms it into improv: thus setting the tune free to new horizons. There are some older famous Jazz artists in this collection such as Dave Brubeck, Roy Hargrove, Joshua Redman, & Dianne Reeves. There are also some newer talent such as Esperanza Spalding & Nikki Panofsky. Yes sometimes the music gets rather wild as in \"Gaston\" by The Bad Plus & Alfredo Rodriguez with \"The Bare Necessities\" enters into Conlon Nancarrow territory (a Classical composer living in Mexico that wrote tunes on player pianos because they were to fast for human hands) by almost reaching player piano speed. This is really fun stuff & is not the typical Disney corny-ness. If you love Jazz, you will love this CD. If you love Disney tunes buy a famous \"Disney\" soundtrack.By the way, the best \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" was done by Keith Jarrett.

Following her dissapointing singles Louboutons & Fresh Out The Oven from her cancelled Love record which was suppose to be released last year but fell through the cracks with being dropped with Sony, she really has lost her shine in great music.

{"text": "This is, by far, Lopez's best work -- and it's about damned time, too -- what the heck have you been waiting for, Jenny...?!! Using just the right mix of Latin rhythm structures with an interpolation of Lambada, RedOne (the Producer, here) mixes this perfectly; the hint of exotica is slight enough to be barely discernible... which is correct for mass market radio, and yes indeed: RedOne has this crafted with radio firmly in mind. I first heard this on middle-of-the-night club radio, and initially assumed it was an unknown Euro-import -- and was delighted to find that it was no such thing (I do hear a touch of dubstep there in the bass line (but  hey, I heard grime in Britney's HOLD IT AGAINST ME, too, so take that for what it's worth), and I definitely like the idea of ANY dubstep (even if it's just a hint) breaking big in American pop). I'd bet you even-money odds that Lady Gaga is screaming at RedOne's answering machine right now that she didn't get this for her follow-up to THE FAME. It's a monster of a record.At 130 beats per minute, RedOne shows a monumental grasp of musical SENSE, here. It would have been VERY tempting to speed this thing up -- and I have no doubt that most DJ's out there will be trying to do just that with their upcoming wave of re-mixes -- but RedOne has this exactly right: 130 BPM, and in common time... clocked for radio, and clocked CORRECTLY. Kinda hard to believe he got agreement from JLo to keep it this \"slow.\" Too, the song is in a very unusual key for dance-pop; my ears have it in E-flat Minor, which is Metallica territory as far as keys go (usually, anything written in E-flat Minor is guitar-originated (the guitar is tuned to E by default), and that makes it a highly unusual key for material in this genre). The key gives the track a slightly darker tone -- and allows the bass line to truly SLAM. It's good work; I like the whole thought-process, here. Lopez delivers her vox with a touch of authority; she comes across with AUTHORITATIVE CLASS. The hook is instantly accessible; there is no need to hear this one a dozen times to get the earworm stuck in your head. Once you hear it, you're stuck with it RIGHT AWAY.Tell you something, here: if Lopez can break this massive radio-friendly unit as big I think she can (and will), a Lambada \"comeback\" (in general) market-wide would not surprise me. Those of you inside the music business might want to think about bidding for the back-rights to the original Lambada. Owning something like that within your back-catalog is worth a mint when something as heavily-derived as this thing is comes along (plus, given the name here (Lopez), you know the push will be mighty indeed).Too, the song is an open invitation to re-mixers. There's so much here to re-mix that I'm glad I'm not spinning the noise for a living. I wouldn't even know where to begin de-constructing this one. We'll be hearing variation of this for a good long while.In other words:Thank you, Jenny.May we have another...?\n", "val": 0.011821969412267208}

I should have read all the reviews and spent more time listening to the preview tracks.GOOD POINTS:  All the songs are well know, simply arranged and easy to recognize.NOT SO GOOD:  The songs are played on what sounds like a very old piano that is sometimes a bit \"twangy\" rather than a well-tuned, rich sounding instrument.  The playing is VERY SIMPLE or \"amateurish\" as another reviewer noted.  The phrasing sometimes feels hesitant.  The songs are extremely short which, for me, does not permit time to meditate on the music because just as you are getting into the song, it stops and jumps to another one.  This hopping around did not produce a \"relaxing\" listening experience.  Ending with a ridiculous 34 second rendition of the Hallelujah Chorus (on an organ, not the piano) is not the ideal way to conclude a relaxing CD.  As another buyer noted, my CD case was also broken when it arrived although it did not affect the CD.\n", "val": 1.178184993477771e-05}

{"text": "With perfect timing for the DVD release of Season One of the HBO series Treme and just a week or so before the start of Season Two, comes this newest release by the musical soundtrack for New Orleans rhythm - The Rebirth Brass Band. Though original member Kermit Ruffins left the band years ago, original founders - the Frazier brothers are still there along with longtime member Glen Andrews and, in the 28 years (can it really be that long?) since the band formed, they haven't lost a beat. (NO pun intended here.)There's music composed by the band members  (\"I Like It Like That\" is truly funky) and the trombones are out front on \"AP Touro\", a song written by Andrews cousin Troy, better known as Trombone Shorty. These guys are even gutsy enough to start off the album with their take on the Dorothy Fields/ Jimmy McHugh chestnut \"Exactly Like You\". Its like they lit a fire under the arrangement! Another highlight is NOLa legendary producer and band leader Dave Bartholomew's \"Shrimp and Gumbo\" which shows how the NOLa beat mixed with jazz riffs to create its own gumbo. \"Feelin' Free\" is a seven-minute-plus take on the Jermaine Jackson song.Mardi Gras may be over for this year but its always time for a New Orleans party. Rebirth is now on Mark Samuels' NOLa-based Basin Street Records label and they are sure to get the promotion all of BSR's fine roster of artists has received. Highly recommended.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\"\n", "val": 0.007643075194209814}

{"text": "We live in an era of great brass bands, a time when people argue over who's the best and global brands sponsor grand competitions. New kids use horns to escape violence while old heads lead protest marches and school programs. As successful as any outfit in the last 30 years, the Rebirth charge forward through this landscape armed with their signature mix of power and filth.The new record begins with \"Exactly Like You,\" a standard and the opposite of your typical brass band boast. Then things get grimy, with the songwriting team of Phil Frazier and Glen Andrews telling us how a certain somebody likes it (front and back) over speeding horns and snare. \"The Dilemma\" gives us that Rebirth swagger and shadow, a missive from a Tuesday night second set. That's a compliment to producer Tracey Freeman. We get short doses without the meandering or filler of a live album, but with a balanced fullness that never sounds overly brightened or packaged.The Troy Andrews-penned \"AP Touro\" allows the fellas to ascend, cut and pound. At their best, the Rebirth sound like martial swordsmen who group into unison when needed, then race out to new vistas or broaden shoulders to hold down the fort (and of course, taking time to stop at the corner bar). We are rarely in unknown territory on Rebirth of New Orleans, but the album transmits the ferocity that defines the contemporary lineup, with fewer words and more minor keys.They test themselves in \"Feelin' Free,\" the crossflows of the horns working in sunny contrasts with wild percussion, sounding Caribbean. Overall, the band resists experimentation with new forms, seemingly more interested in blowing the doors off than opening new ones. And, as this record attests, the Rebirth still blows doors off quite nicely.--Brian Boyles, OffBeat Magazine, April 2011 issue.\n", "val": 0.009240499697625637}

{"text": "Vic Anesisni has done a brilliant job with this set of remasters. Finally somebody has restored The Wall Of Sound digitally to all it's glory. These masters are superb: they're big and dense, and can be cranked up to the rafters with no sonic loss. The louder they are, the better they sound.As for one reviewer's claim that the shrieking \"Retrospective\" remasters by Bob Ludwig are superior..well, that's a joke. He's shaved and NR'd them to death, and then added ear-bleeding highs in excess.From the very first crunch of the saxes and thwack of the drum, listeners know they're in for a treat with Sony's new Ronettes disc. All discs in the series come mighty close to the essence of all those beloved Philles 45s which captured not only a generation's imagination, but taught an industry how good records were made. All these tracks were recorded in analog, and it's amazing how the analog warmth is retained. The Ronettes have never sounded better.In an era of loud, too-bright and essentially unlistenable CDs, it's to Legacy's - and Vic Anesini's -  credit that they've actually understood the music, and knocked themselves out to present it the way it was meant to be heard.Legacy/Sony has already treated us to the magnificent Dylan mono remasters, and they've done it again with the Spector / Philles catalog. They're listening to what customers want, rather than the loud minority who still believe digital remasters should not sound warm,  or remotely like the original recordings.\n", "val": 0.0064958916045725346}
{"text": "Phil Spector's WALL OF SOUND RETROSPECTIVE: Philles Records 1961 - 1966 remastered by Bob Ludwig is still the best Spector collection (not by much though.) The ABKCO sets and BACK TO MONO box set had extremely muddy sound quality and were not transferred from first generation tapes, so there was a lot of room to improve on in sound quality for the Spector catalogue. Unfortunately this over-hyped SONY LEGACY re-issue still does not sound as if it has been transferred from first-generation tapes.  The songs still sound flat and lifeless, just more clear, than they did on the ABKCO sets. I really can't say that any mono mixes of Spector's music on CD are satisfactory. So maybe they could try issuing some Stereo, and see if that will fare better. There is an upcoming box set of all of the Philles Albums, but that will surely be the same mono mixes as these although many are still hopeful for first-time Stereo mixes.Another gripe, is that SONY LEGACY boasted that they had access to unreleased material from the Spector vaults. There isn't a single previously unreleased song featured on this collection. Don't waste your money. Couldn't they have added a few Bonus Stereo mixes to the CD, for \"Be My Baby\", \"Walkin' in the Rain,\" and \"Baby I Love You?\"Since all of us collectors and fans of Spectors already own the ABKCO sets...these releases seem extremely rendundant since they did little to improve the poor ABKCO sound quality.\n", "val": 2.1948926587356254e-05}

This isn't the vault discovery that fans are waiting for, and many will complain about the all-mono line-up, but with ABKCO's set itself a collector's item, this is a welcome overview of the group's biggest hits.

I still think these remasters sound a little bit muddy like the Abkco CD. I am playing this on a decent quality Sony boombox CD player and I think it is muddy. I'm listening to this CD by downloading flac versions from YouTube of this particular album, and I used it to help complete my Ronettes Phille Spectre anthology double CD of their complete recorded output. I have titled it \"Be My Baby: Complete Original Phille's Anthology 62- 66\". I think instead of releasing this 18 track disc, it would have been a better idea to include all the masters over 2 discs on 36 tracks. The Ronettes discography is really small, and it could all cram itself on a double album. Everything here is wonderful and everything not here is great. I've loved this girl group for the last 7 years now, and all the songs brought back memories for me.\n", "val": 4.313244062359445e-05}

{"text": "The Ronettes were Phil Spector's  big group between the Crystals and the Righteous Brothers. Like most of the early sixties girl groups they were from New York  and first came to anyone's attention in a talent show, this time at the Apollo.  Unlike the Shirelles and the Crystals who were barely out of high school and had no real show business experience, the Ronettes had already been dancers in Murray the K's shows and had signed with Colpix Records as Ronnie & the Relatives, though without any chart success. After auditioning for Spector, at his advice they told Colpix they were getting out of show business to get out of their contract and immediately signed with his Philles label.Spector shelved their first proposed single, why Don't They Let Us Fall In Love, which is generously included here for fans who are interested in hearing these kinds of lost tracks. He was basically right in this case. It's a nice song, but not the kind of knock it out of the park single that starts a career. That was their first released single, Be My Baby which was not only a #2 charting single in the Fall of '63 but one of the great classics of the rock era. Phil Spector had his faults but he had a great ear for hits and skill in every step of making them.Of course they got the full Spector treatment with ample enough echo to make them sound like they were recorded in a cathedral, multiple backup singers that sometimes included the always dependable Darlene Love and sometimes Sonny Bono and his girlfriend Cher. Add to that the usual piano, drums including timpani, clapping and castanets, and and a backup band that sometimes included strings and you got a single that was practically an event. It was not for nothing that Spector's name was usually included with the Brill building composers he used; his production was part of the song writing process in which the original melody and words were just the basic material he built on.The overall sound of the Ronettes was dyamic, positive and upbeat.  Even in a wishful song like Be My Baby, you know they'll get their guy.  The Ronettes look was unique, with their hair teased impossibly high and a generally exotic air. They came in toward the end of the Girl Group Era, which was cut short by the British Invasion.  The girl groups from 1964 on were new ones like the Shangri-Las and Dixie Cups. Only two of the earlier girl groups had hits after 1963: the Chiffons had Sweet Talkin' Guy in 1966 and the Ronettes had Walking In the Rain in the fall of '64. That song not only features the sound of thunder and rain but also an advanced stage in the development of the sound that Spector would find great success with the Righteous Brothers.many of the Ronettes 1965 and '66 tracks are here, and they're all beautifully produced with great care. yet nothing happened for them after Walking In the Rain. Things were moving so fast and changing rapidly that by 1965 the early sixties girl group sound seemed old. it wasn't just the Ronettes, but every girl group who weren't having hits; the whole early sixties pop edifice vanished overnight with few survivors. The other part of the story comes from interviews with Ronnie and others who claim that Spector withheld many songs from release to keep the Ronettes dependent on him. Considering that Ronnie was practically being held captive in Spector's mansion, it's believable.No matter what, these are all great songs and the disc is a winner all the way through. The EMI Legacy series has done a beautiful job with the sound, something that can't be overestimated in importance. These sound just like they should, with all the complex parts in their original balance. It makes all earlier Ronettes compilations obsolete. Be sure to check out their equally excellent Crystals disc.\n", "val": 0.002645106753334403}

But I definitely notice a decline in the quality of the production and songs after you get past the songs from the one Ronettes LP.  \"Here I Sit\" is catchy enough, but the sound is more like mush and from what I read, it's not her sister and cousin on background vocals.  I am guessing Spector was paying more attention to the Righteous Brothers.  There are songs like \"Soldier Baby of Mine\" and \"Home of the Brave\" that, to my ears, are superior to the songs after cut 11.  \"Paradise\" is the one exception, and I'd put that among the 5 top Ronettes songs.  I heard Ronnie sing \"Paradise\" live a few years back and got all excited!

{"text": "\"Be My Baby: The Very Best of the Ronettes,\" pretty well delivers what it promises, the best of the early work of Ronnie Spector, nee Bennett, and her backing group, the Ronettes.  And, due to the intransigence of her mad genius former boss and husband, Phil Spector, it was  only just released last year.Ronnie Spector's big throbbing, sensual voice, her instantly-recognizable tremelo and her \"oo oo oo's,\" (borrowed from Frankie Lyman of \"The Teenagers,\") made her one of the greatest female rock and roll stars of her day, rock's original bad girl, in  basically the early 1960's, as lead singer of \"The Ronettes. \" She and the relatives of hers who constituted The Ronettes were instantly recognizable in person too: They wore the highest hair, the shortest, tightest skirts, the highest heels; and nobody stepped higher. She worked for producer Phil Spector, as is well-known, in his legendary studio, Gold Star, where he invented the wall of sound: basically backing up his powerful rock singers with full orchestral sound.  He called his productions `mini symphonies for teenagers.'Ronnie began life, a young, half-Puerto Rican, half Native American Indian girl, had that remarkable voice, was \"discovered\" as a dancing teenager, and, of course, married Spector, the boss. She always said that marriage was her toughest gig, and recent history seems to bear her out on that.  Her voice, with its tremolo, boomed out of jukeboxes world wide, with \"Be My Baby,\" \"Baby I Love You,\" and \"Walking In The Rain,\"among other hits. She and the cousins also toured with the Rolling Stones, the only girl group ever to do so, and played a major part in Spector's evergreen Christmas album of 1963. She's just inescapably part of everybody's sound track of that time: A lot of people danced to her voice, and romanced to it, too. I've been lucky enough to see her in person several times. Think I will not soon forget watching her one sunny lunch time, free concert at the World Trade Center, when it was there. The sheer joy of the crowd, a thousand voices singing with her: \"For every kiss you give me, I'll give you three.\" And a man who appeared to be African by his dress dancing ecstatically to her music on one of the giant urns that dotted the Trade Center Plaza. Well, I think we all felt that way:  Prominent Long Island born rocker Billy Joel tells us that as teenagers, he and his friends always knew they were going to get lucky with the girls when \"Be My Baby\" boomed out of the jukebox.Of course, when Ronnie split with Spector, personally and professionally, and took up a solo career, it was years before her former producer allowed her to use this repertory.  And, obviously, years before he allowed its rerelease on record.  (I've read and reviewed, in fact own, her memoir&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Be-My-Baby-How-I-Survived-Mascara-Miniskirts-and-Madness-or-My-Life-as-a-Fabulous-Ronette/dp/0451411536/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness, or My Life as a Fabulous Ronette</a>, and Darlene Love's as well,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/My-Name-Is-Love-The-Darlene-Love-Story/dp/0688156576/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Name Is Love: The Darlene Love Story</a>: neither one of them easy to find.) But finally, we have her inimitable early hits here:  \"Be My Baby,\" \"Baby I Love You,\" \"The Best Part of Breaking Up,\" \"Do I Love You?\" \"Walking in the Rain,\" and \"I Can Hear Music.\"  As is true of many of my greatest favorites, I actually own the original vinyl of this record, but, of course, it's too precious to play.

{"text": "The Ronettes were essentially a family singing group that arose when sisters Estelle and Veronica \"Ronnie\" Bennett and cousin Nedra Talley began singing with various other family members at family gatherings.  In time they began to play small time gigs and after a while began to work as club dancers--a fact that contributed to their wildly over-the-top visual style of impossibly high beehive hairdos and ultra slinky attire.  After significant struggles and at least one record deal that didn't work out, they came to the attention of Phil Spector, creator of \"the wall of sound\" and a producer noted for his talent at working with girl groups.  After that it was pretty much straight up all the way: The Ronettes eclipsed Martha and the Vandellas, The Marvelettes, The Crystal, and even The Supremes.  Believe it or not, at one time The Rolling Stones was their opening act, and they were the only girl group to share the stage with The Beatles.Unfortunately, Spector's romantic interest in Ronnie led him to make unexpected decisions about the group's career.  The Ronettes did several early recordings that Spector attributed to The Crystals; later, when the group toured as the opening act for The Beatles, Spector sent Estelle and Nedra out with their cousin Elaine and kept Ronnie in California, where she recorded vocal tracks with such singers as a very young Cher Bono acting as back up.  Spector continued to make records with The Ronettes, but often as not he refused to release the tracks--most notable the first recording of \"Chapel of Love\"--and it became apparent that his extreme jealousy over Ronnie had motivated him to wreck the trio's career, the better to keep Ronnie at home.  In later years, Ronnie wrote that Spector kept a virtual prisoner in their home, and that she literally had to break out in order to get away from him.Because of the way Spector handled The Ronettes, it isn't always easy to tell what the full trio recorded, but this much seems certain: anything released under the name \"The Ronettes\" at least featured Ronnie Spector on lead vocal.  And it's all damn good stuff.  The Ronettes came across as exotic, multi-racial, sexy, sweet, and yet street-smart.  And while BE MY BABY: THE VERY BEST OF THE RONETTES does not include everything they recorded, it at least contains the big hits.  It just doesn't get better than \"Be My Little Baby,\" \"Baby I Love You,\" and \"Walking In The Rain\"--and although their other recordings might be less well know, they are no less memorable.  And there there is absolutely mistaking Ronnie Spector's voice.  No one else ever sounded quite like her; she was a genuine original, and as such she had a tremendous impact on later girl singers, most recently Amy Winehouse, who borrowed Ronnie Spector's look and a few of her vocal licks as well.There have been a good many complaints about the sound quality on BE MY BABY.  I personally think it should be given a better remaster than it has here, but in truth it's not bad--certainly not as bad as many of the earlier releases.  If you're a Ronettes fan, you'll probably want to hunt down other releases in the hope of something more pristine, but I think this will do the trick for most listeners.  And after all: it's Ronnie Spector.  It just doesn't get better than that.GFT, Amazon Reviewer\n", "val": 0.000298596074571833}

That Ronette sound is so different than say the Supremes that you can't help but take notice.Some of the lyrics are very teenage-oriented with phrases like \"too young to go steady\" and \"too young, can't marry no one\" -- of course the Ronettes were just teenagers themselves when they recorded these songs -- but that doesn't interfere with listening pleasure. There's an edge to Ronnie Spector's voice that belies the youthful sound and innocent lyrics, so you don't get bubble-gum pop overload.The songs collected here were recorded from 1963-1969 and I can't find a weak one in the bunch. Even though they were recorded at different times and have different themes like longing for love, being in love, and then breaking up, and appeared on different albums, the entire CD has consistency so none of the tracks seem out of place.A CD booklet is included and contains color and black & white pictures, liner notes by Lenny Kaye written in 2007, and information on each track (chart position, record date, album title, etc.).Each song has been remastered and sounds great! I have to admit that it took me a little while to get used to the Phil Spector \"Wall Of Sound\" technique of recording because at first it sounds like each track was recorded in a cavern with lots of spatial echoing and sounds muffled. But on repeated listening, I've discovered that the echo is more on the music and the vocals are centered and quite clear. The music sort of envelops the vocals, more so than the Motown sound, and so I guess it takes a while for the brain to recognize that there is separation.Again I've have no experience with the vinyl or other editions of the Ronettes releases with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Phil-Spector-Collection/dp/B000K2Q8DQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Phil Spector Collection</a>, so I can't really say if the sound on this CD is at its best, I know that one reviewer doesn't seem to think so, but it sounds OK to me.Anyway, I highly recommend picking up the Ronettes' BE MY BABY: THE VERY BEST OF THE RONETTES if you like 60s music.

{"text": "\"Be My Baby\" by The Ronettes remains an incredibly passionate, romantic song to this day; just as another reviewer notes many people know this song well and are very impressed with it. On this tune The Ronettes weaved their best magic and it catapulted the group to the top.The lead singer, Veronica Bennett, married Phil Spector and changed her name to Ronnie Spector--and wow, does she handle the lead vocals on this tune like a pro! Backup singers Estelle Bennett (Veronica's sister) and their cousin Nedra Talley do the perfect job of supporting Ronnie. \"Be My Baby\" is also notable for being the very first song on which Cher sang vocals; Cher did extra backup the day this was recorded when someone didn't show up! All together, these ladies never miss a note or fail to harmonize flawlessly.This excellent tune is a must have for just about any collection of music by The Ronettes, 1960s girl groups and even pop; others will appreciate their R&B styled music.\n", "val": 0.052839942276477814}
{"text": "this early rock n roll classic has stood the test of time - i've heard younger people gasp in appreciation when i mentioned the titlewith a pounding arrangement running in contrast to the lyrical quality of the melody and lyrics - it hooks right from the start - to the finishthe attractive girl group only added to the songs luster - Veronica Bennett - the lead singer - was adorable and sexy - but her voice and looks were not the most beautiful of the era - her backup singers - Estelle Bennett and Nedra Talley - were more classically pretty - nevertheless - Ronnie was simply one of the most charismatic of all the singers in that generation - if the group's career hadn't stalled with Ronnie's marriage to producer Phil Spector - i suspect she would have led the group to a career that challenged The Supremesthis song certainly is as good as anything that other group did\n", "val": 0.021885914728045464}

{"text": "When The Ronettes recorded \"Be My Baby,\" they had quite a hit! The song ranked very high on both the Billboard pop (#2) and R&B charts (#4) not long after it was originally released; and you'll know why when you hear it! Even all these years later, this tune remains charming and very sweet--perfect for dancing all alone late at night with your sweetheart in the living room. The Ronettes don't skip a beat, either--they perform this flawlessly and I'm very impressed. The combination of great backup vocalists (which include Darlene Love, Sonny Bono and Cher), the lead vocals by Ronnie Spector and that music with its percussion all combine to produce a magical song that I will never tire of hearing.This is something any fan of The Ronettes and/or Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" music will like; and newcomers to their artistry will enjoy it, too--indeed, Brian Wilson said that \"Be My Baby\" is \"the greatest pop record ever made -- no arguments here.\"You won't be able to listen to this just once--this music is all THAT good. Enjoy it!\n", "val": 0.03946107625961304}

Her single, Rolling In The Deep from her sophmore album 21, is really gritty and she captures a deep essence into the feeling of her song through her voice.
