{"text": "From a US-centric view... I didn't recognize any track as being a tango one could really tango to (the rhythms are too variable), but track 2 came closest to my concept of a tango, a couple others seemed to be tango-based. None of them evoked the Pampas for me or felt like 'folklore' music (though the ballads were really quite good).  However, my experience with Argentinian music is severely lacking.  Perhaps these are tangos for those tired of the rest of the tangos, and 'modern' takes on timeless classics?There are 3 sung ballads (5, 9, 10), and the rest are instrumental.  A few are guitar-based, a few piano-based, some with concertina and/or violin.  Sounds most like easy classical jazz to me.  2 and 8 felt \"dance-able\" to me.  7 is a bit \"spanish guitar\"-ish plus flutes.The musicianship and production are excellent, and the vocals are very fine.  I did enjoy most of the selections.  If you like gentle jazz as well as latin music, this is likely right up your alley.  However... if you're hoping to bite a rose and get your feet moving, you might be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.0007794300327077508}

Complaints from the first album of being a little \"too polished\" continue here, albeit to a lesser degree.

I never really was a big fan of the band, but I thought I'd give this baby another listen just to be sure. These guys had nothing wrong with them, but they just failed to deliver any songs that made me go WOW! It's completely acceptable to make decent records like Little Caesar did, however, for my money they weren't one of the better bands of the time.

Heaven forbid that the band looked like a bunch of bikers and weren't pretty like Poison, Winger, White Lion, and a slew of other more successful bands. And none of those bands made an album this good. They also brought the goods live as evidenced on that year's tour with Kiss and Slaughter. I saw them on this tour and they blew the more popular Slaughter away. The fans loved them. This album has a great balance of hard rock anthems, emotional power ballads, and soulful tracks. The best known song is their very good rocking version of Aretha Franklin's \"Chain of Fools\" which received some radio airplay. \"Hard Times\" is a fantastic anthem while \"Down N' Dirty\", \"Rock N' Roll State of Mind\", and \"Drive It Home\" are good time hard rockers that work very well. Their soulful side reveals itself on their awesome cover of the R&B standard \"I Wish It Would Rain\" and their own \"Midtown\". And as great as all of these tracks are, their ballads were even better as \"In Your Arms\" has a fantastic chorus and a great vocal from Ron Young while the harder and more melancholy \"From the Start\" is a killer with a memorable melody. Other strong tracks include \"Little Queenie\", \"Wrong Side of the Tracks\", and the driving \"Cajun Panther\" which would be featured in the movie, \"Another 48 Hours\".

By chance, I once happened to hear it on Shazam and ID'd it, then bought it right away off Amazon.

{"text": "Really fun, smooth, and soothing sounds for your tiki and exotica background music. Without question, this the best tropical themed album I own. Be warned, though, that you'd better have a rum drink in hand when you've got this playing! Overall, I'd say this an updated version of the classic Martin Denney/Arthur Lyman albums of the 50's and 60's - a little more contemporary and diverse but obviously playing homage to that era. You'll love all the tropical bird effects, tremolo guitars, and \"take me to a simpler time\" feel ingrained in the music. The whole album is solid and upbeat, with no weak spots, and even the cheesy intro seems appropriate once you get used to it. The sound quality is excellent, even played through my High-End home stereo system. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this for your Luau and Tiki parties. I don't know who these musicians are, but I just hope Amazon make's the Tikiyaki Orchestra's second album available on CD soon.\n", "val": 0.038993384689092636}

{"text": "Excellent, Excellent effort, Lil Mike...!!!That being said, I can add the following changes. Most are just for purity of Nomenclature. Rest assured, they're no biggie :)Tk 1:- \"Sete Palavras\" is by \"Pedro Bento & Z Da Estrada\" (per the CD sleeve Front) or \"Pedro Bento e Z Da Estrada\" (to keep it Spanish). Also note the accent on Z's name.Trk 4:- The song is by Ado Negro all right. However, what's interesting is, this sampler version is the Studio version, while Amazon is actually 'selling' only a LIVE version. Guess we can call this studio version \"An Amazon Freebie Exclusive!!!\" :)Tk 7: The song name is \"L Vem a Onda\", not \"L Vema Onda\".Tk 8: The artist is 'Arlindo Jr\"Tk 12: Unfortunately, this is not correct. Demnios da Garoa DOES HAVE a \"Samba da Garoa\" from the album \"E Convidados\". However, it is 5:01 min long, and from the Amazon preview, it sounds pretty bombastic. The 3:36 version in this sampler is a soft And sentimental song... doesn't AT ALL sound like a \"Samba\". Admittedly, I am Stumped as well on this one. If I had to venture a guess, Amazon may have screwed up and uploaded the wrong song for the right title (or vice versa).Any of our Spanish-speaking friends wanna help out here?That's all I can find out. Now I'm gonna shut off my smokin' brain, lean back and listen to the whole CD again.... :)\n", "val": 6.722189573338255e-05}

Due to unavailable artist tags in the mp3 files I downloaded from Amazon, I researched other albums on the Brazilian Atrao label to find out the names of the artists. Such a sloppy effort to inform us of the actual names of the artists, makes me wonder about the commitment and competency of the label and it's digital distributor \"The Orchard\", the company that owns eMusic as well.

I saw Hank Senior and The Carter Family within 100 yards of my own home some time around 1950 (Yes, that was right here in little ol' Port Saint Joe, FL in the very house that I have retired back to!!). I still treasure my copies of the sheet-music that I purchased on those two occasions.In my opinion, C&W song-writing has survived the onslaught of time, technology, etc., better than has song-writing in any other non-classical musical genre that I know of.But songs this good have come to my attention almost never in my 60+ years of attentive listening.On first audition, I felt sure it that the thing was an oldie. When I found out that Easton Corbin has only 4 MP3 items, and no \"full\" album yet, I got excited!Next, upon researching songwriter Rory Lee Feek, I found out  that he has been very much around since the early Nineties, that he has had at least 1 #1, and that he is now producing songs with his vocalist wife, Joey (\"Joey and Rory\").Falk also has several MP3 items available for download. Check him out. Google or Bing will bring him up.The pleasurable process of listening to every available second of Mr. Easton Corbin and of Mr. Rory Lee Feek remains ahead of me. But if either of them again come close to this item, that'll be going some, you'd better believe me!\n", "val": 0.02065153233706951}

Actually, it's not only kids: There's an adult lead singer, too.I've just bought this album through this site a couple of minutes ago and I think it'll be a nice start for my Kidz Bop collection. Then, upon receipt of the CD, I'll see if the performers themselves can give me the other five.I like Kidz Bop Kids because the kids are so good! I now happen to know one of them, because I chatted with him a few times through the MSN Gaming Zone. When we first chatted, the kid was sooooooo nice that I immediately put him into my ZoneFriends list.KIDZ BOP KIDS - Kids with talent and an EXCELLENT albumI want to add that I've been a fan of the KIDZ BOP KIDS since I heard their version of Ricky Martin's \"Livin' la vida loca\". Well done, Kidz Bop Kids!Thanks for letting me share my thoughts with everyone. The CD arrived and it's quite good.Thanks, Kidz Bop Kids! I love you!\n", "val": 0.2740532457828522}
{"text": "Having listened to this with my 7 and 9 year old nieces, I can honestly say that this CD has little to no redeeming value. I could actually put up with this for less than 15 minutes if the songs were cleaned up, but they're not! Also worth noting is these children's deafening lack of vocal talent and the bland-sounding adult \"vocalists\". If you want decent, clean music for your children that is truly clean and won't make you insane, then buy Warner Brothers' \"Space Jam\" soundtrack, Disney's \"Lilo & Stitch\" and \"Brother Bear\" soundtracks, or Dreamworks' \"Shrek\", \"Anastasia\", and \"Shrek 2\" soundtracks. Just not this. Think of the kids, please.\n", "val": 0.0009050013613887131}
{"text": "I heard some of the songs on Kids Bop in the TV commercial--The renditions of those hit songs were not good.  Let's face it, they're doing versions of some very expensive productions from those big name artists. Sadly, they sound cheap, as if they recorded it on some karaoke machine instead of live. And only Britney Spears should sing \"Oops I Did It Again,\" not have some kids sing along to it.  I know this is an attempt to make these familiar pop songs clean for the kids, but kids get into music pretty quick these days.  They know every song and lyric, line and chorus, and hum to every 22-second  section of these songs.I know that the KIDZ BOP series has been successful in the sales, but leave the hit songs to the professionals--they know how to do it right, no matter how good, crazy, bizarre, explicit, funny, bland, magnificent or superb that they make it.

{"text": "This music has an instantly hypnotic impact on any child in earshot.  The opening strains of any Kidz tune immediately quiets the most restless members of the twins' playgroup, as if a subsonic chord added in the studio has activated a reptilian part of the brain that atrophies away before adolescence.  Queue up \"Steal my Sunshine\" and watch the most rambunctious pack of budding anarchists cohere into a docile, glassy-eyed choir, singing tunelessly along with the chorus.  We now have three copies of this remarkable sonic sedative - one for the home, one for the car, and one tucked away with a portable CD player in Mrs. Higgensworth's purse.  Some prefer the original two-CD version of Kidz Bop, still available in some places, which featured an additional twelve tracks that were extirpated from this single-disk release.  I believe that songs were purged due largely to the Bohemian nature of their subject matter (e.g. \"She's So High\" and \"Kiss Me\"), however some apparently fell victim to the vicissitudes of fashion (e.g. \"MmmBop,\" as Hansen is now laughably pass even in under-five circles).  All told the single-CD version is a better choice for parents on a budget, or for those merely wishing to forestall the inevitable day when their children start singing odes to controlled substances and the like.\n", "val": 0.01249218825250864}

The lyrics are easier to understand and my girls really enjoy singing along. I even catch myself singing along with them in the car. The songs are catchy and I much prefer listening to Kidz Bop than other kids songs CDs.

This is an awesome gift item for kids who love music.  I like how all the songs are clean and you don't have to worry about what is coming on next like you have to when listening to the radio.  The radio now and days have some songs that aren't appropriate for minors and here with KIDZ BOP, your child can listen to all the hot hits being performed from kids on their own level.

{"text": "Truth is, my boy/girl twins who are 3 years old, really enjoy this CD.  We bought it due to their interest in the enticing advertisements on television which show children dancing around singing cheerfully to pop \"hits.\"  My son has long appreciated Smash-Mouth's \"All-Star\" and since these tracks are slower versions of the originals, the lyrics are more easily heard.  My son now proudly performs his dramatic and adorable version of the song with correct and complete lyrics for all 3 verses.  My daughter, to my chagrin, loves to belt out the lyrics to \"Oops!  I did it again!\" formerly by Brittney Spears.  This has been a mixed blessing for us.  On one hand, my kids really like the upbeat songs, and the (mostly) easily undertood lyrics.  On the other hand, they rarely listen to Top 40 music, and would never have otherwise been exposed to the lyrics of some of these songs were it not for this CD.  For this, I now regret buying it.  Some song choices are questionable at best, like the one song with lyrics that say, \"I steal your honey like I stole your bike.\" and the song with lyrics that say, \"I'm not that innocent.\" or the other songs mentioned in previous reviews.  While it may be charming that my 3 year old son performs his favorite song to everyone he meets, singing, \"So what's wrong with taking the back streets?  You'll never know if you don't go....\"  it is horrifying to watch my 3 year old daughter sing, \"I'm not that innocent!\"As for the quality of the recordings, be forewarned:  the songs are not entirely sung by children as the advertisements might lead you to believe.  They are primarily sung by adult vocalists (different for each song) with the children singing back-up on the chorus.  This was a fact NOT LOST on my 3 year old son, who announced that these songs weren't really \"KidzBop Songs\" but really, \"PeoplezBop Songs\" since the kids didn't always sing.  They are slower, watered-down, more generic, and less interesting versions than the originals, and while my kids really like this CD, they have liked all of the CD's bought especially for them, to include KidSongs, 'One Magical Night' by Russ Bono, the exquisite 'Counting Sheep' by Colin Raye, 'Return to Pooh Corner' by Kenny Loggins, 'A Playdate with Blue', and a truly delightful musical CD featuring songs from the Dragon Tales PBS TV show.In retrospect, I wish I had known all of the songs on this CD before purchasing it, or I wish I had at least known all of the lyrics to the songs I *thought* I knew on this CD.  I wouldn't have ever bought it.  While this may be appropriate for older children, at the point the lyrics become appropriate, children of that age group would not be interested in this anymore.  I would say this is NOT really appropriate for very young children, at least those under 5 due to lyrics and song choice.Remember the advertised suggestion that parents will enjoy listening to this music as much as their children?

{"text": "Like several of the other reviewers, I enjoyed much of the collection despite understanding little of what was being said. The overall sound of the album is retro, recalling 1980s pop -- NOT New Wave, mind you, but the pop of singers like Sting and Stevie Nicks, with a lot of reverb, keyboards, and synthesizers.I liked Estar Shamir's \"Gachliliot (Fireflies)\" best. The arrangement is more folky and eclectic, with guitar, bongos, and accordion. She has a strong, expressive voice. I also enjoyed Hemi Rudner's \"Geula (Redemption),\" an even-keeled lite rocker that recalls John Lennon's \"Mind Games\" and Al Stewart's \"Flying Sorcery\". (Rudner also records in English--he has an album of Beatles and Stones covers) \"Yoshvim Bebet Cafe (Sitting In A Coffee House)\" by the Teapacks, with its bouncy synthesizers, shows more New Wave influence and, in the bridge, gives the strongest nod to Middle Easternness in the collection. Miri Mesika's \"Tipa Tipa (Little By Little)\" sounds at first like it's going to be a folky acoustic tune, but halfway through it turns into something like a power ballad by Gloria Estefan. \"Magic Time\" by Hadara Levin Areddy differs from the rest of the collection in two ways: it is in English, and it is strongly blues-influenced. Hadara has (or puts on) an intriguingly goofy voice and matching accent (her \"now\" rhymes with \"meow\"), sounding something like a cross between Betty Carter and Madeleine Peyroux. Ohad Hitman's \"Hashavti She'Yehiye Romanti (I Thought It Will Be Romantic),\" could be an early, overproduced Sting song.\n", "val": 0.01020115613937378}
{"text": "I am glad that people who don't understand Hebrew were willing to download this sampler and give it a spin. I appreciate that they are interested in reaching out to other cultures even if they can only take away a part of it for now. And maybe other reviewers will come along and fill in more of the picture as time goes by.I think Israeli pop music is special because often the lyrics are taken verbatim from Israeli poetry of the modern era, not to mention an entire genre of songs by religious performers, for the religious sector of Israeli society, who have produced some majorly rockin' vibes of Biblical verses and passages. As a more secular listener, I especially love the songs that bring to life the words of such poets as Leah Goldberg, Natan Alterman, Yehuda Amichai, Chaim Nachman Bialik, Rachel, Natan Zach, and others. In fact, one of my favorite albums is called \"An Evening of Poets' Songs\" (Erev Shirei Meshorerim).One of the loveliest songs in this little sampler is Asthar Shamir's Gachliliyot (Fireflies), music and lyrics both written by the singer. I found a translation of the lyrics online and am posting them here, maybe those who don't speak Hebrew will enjoy the song more once they know what it's about.All credit and appreciation for the translation goes to Ayelet Bukai of Sunnyvale, California, who is listed on the website [...] as the translator.I'm returning to the forest to gather firefliesTiny lights I have left behindWords heavy from griefthat couldn't flySongs I didn't gather when I left.I'm returning to the past to gather firefliesTo build with them a ladder of starsPathways I didn't take, which could not have been thereMaybe they are still waiting there for meIf you will go there, my heartCome to the past without stoppingWe will gather all the goodWe will gather all the innocenceWe will gather fireflies and returnA girl is there waiting, she falls in love without seeingFireflies surround her with bright lightCome back to me, I will keep you from harmTogether we will grow strongerI go back to the past, with no fear of the timeI can tell right from wrongWe will gather all the good, the light and the innocenceAnd bring them back hereIf you will go there, my heartCome to the past without stoppingWe will gather all the goodWe will gather all the innocenceWe will gather fireflies and return\n", "val": 0.003435032209381461}

Although they didn't write the song and were the fourth choice to record it,  Simple Minds transformed it into an anthem.  They perfectly captured the angst and self-absortion of the middle to upper class teen.  The opening riff and hey hey hey hey, ooh ooo start are instantly recognizable and iconic.  The song meshes seamlessly into what John Hughes was trying to capture on screen with The Breakfast Club and they permanently intertwined.  It is impossible to think of one without the other.  The song was a monster hit in the spring of 1985, going all the way to number one.\n", "val": 0.029886972159147263}

On a couple tracks they almost have that indie-folk sound that so many artists have nowadays but it's generally the contemporary semi-pop, which is not a problem.

It's really hard to get an idea of how many good Christian artists just by listening to radios anymore. Never heard of them, but after clicking the preview I was pleasantly surprised. Sidewalk Prophets got the music, the lyrics and the message. I always buy by albums since you learn more about the artists by going through all the songs, just like reading a book. There's not a single bad song to be skipped here, every single one is worth listening! Although I would I easily pick the \"The words I would say\" as my favorite song, my son thinks it's \"For what it's worth\", but my wife disagrees and says \"Change this heart\".

{"text": "Let me start off by saying that that despite my weird obsession for Dashboard Confessional, I have pretty much grown out of the whiny \"emo\" style of music.  Not saying that is what the soundtrack actually sounds like, since it's not, but a quick glance at the artists and that is what you expect.  A whiny, angst-ridden soundtrack for a movie that really looks bad according to the trailers.Well, the movie still looks pretty bad since the only thing it has going for it is Megan Fox who is wearing out her welcome with me quite quickly, the soundtrack on the other hand is pretty interesting to say the least.I originally picked it up to listen to the Dashboard track.  While not an amazing song it does work to satisfy my DC crave.  The rest of the album is actually not bad.  While some of the songs have been previously released, I hadn't heard many of them so I guess I am the target market in that sense.Lets start off with the good.  The Panic at the Disco song is pretty good.  A departure from the first album that I am familiar with, it is pretty catchy.  Hayley Williams, the lead singer for Paramore, contributes a track, \"Teenagers\", and it is pretty good.  The annoyance is kept down and her high pitches that I hate Paramore for at times are kept to a minimum.  I don't skip the track so that is definately a compliment.A band I never heard of, Low Shoulder has a track that is catchy, \"Through The Trees\".  I really like it.  Same with \"Time\" from Cute is What We Aim For.  I don't normally like them since again that whiny stuff has pretty much passed me by, but it is a good song.  The cover of \"I Can See Clearly Now\" is an interesting take and has grown on me.  \"Little Lover's So Polite\" from the Silversun Pickups, which I currently own on their first album, is a good contribution.  Finally, the Cobra Starship track is ok.  It isn't offensive or unpleasurable, just average.Now the bad is the rest of the album.  The rest of the tracks are just whiny and annoying.  I skipped through them subsequent playthroughs.  \"New In Town\" and and \"Kiss With a Fist\" are especially bad.Overall the soundtrack isn't bad.  A solid 8 tracks is more than I can say for most albums or soundtracks so it isn't too difficult to recommend.  Add in an extra star if you are in high school since honestly, you are probably the target market and will know a few of the artists that I didn't mention above.  I hadn't heard of a few of the folks on here and a little google was in order for the research.Again, not a terrible soundtrack.  Average to me, but it was an interesting surprise based on the \"known\" artists on the track list.  It isn't all whiny \"emo\" music which I appreciate.\n", "val": 0.004208440892398357}

It has echoes of the songs Juno had, but, dare I say it, more \"hardcore\". Yeah, that seems right - \"Hardcore Juno\".Not hardcore with thrashing heads and heavy metal, hardcore as in more heavy than the music on Juno's fifty-billion editions of the soundtrack.A few songs stand out: obviously, Panic! At The Disco's \"New Perspective\" is catchy a short and sweet for those who like Panic! (like me), \"Kiss With A Fist\" by Florence and the Machine is worth a few listens, but is nothing ground-breaking. Little Boots' \"New In Town\" is catchy and up-beat, and fits with what I've seen with the film perfectly. Cobra Starship's \"Chew Me Up and Spit Me Out\" is funky and dancey, and a pleasant listening experience. Probably by favourite song is \"Toxic Valentine\" by a band I've never heard of: All Time Low. Don't ask me why, I guess it just sounds awesome. I'll probably check their records out sooner or later.The range of styles on here, there should be at least one song to please anyone that listens to this.

Also enjoyed the Nickel Eye song - a clear REM/Michael Stipe influence, and they pull it off well.  The Thea Gilmore song could be straight from a Cowboy Junkies album, very easy to listen to.  The Leslie Mendelson song reminded me of Laura Nyro - I really like her sound, wanted this song to be better, but I hope we will hear more from her in the future.

If however, you are just looking to build a music library on a budget, I'd highly recommend checking out Amazon's free / cheap collection of music, featuring songs as well as albums.  A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a (more substantial) price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.This album is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?And don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies or really good digital music deals (69 cent songs, $5 albums!), you can always check hereFREE MUSIC:From Amazon Home page --> Departments (drop down menu) --> Digital and Prime Music -->Deals --> Songs by Price / Albums by Price (on left side of screen)\n", "val": 0.004433158319443464}

{"text": "There are few comedians that can ride the line between smart and crass. Oswalt is one of those. His timing is excellent, his well written and conceived bits are second to none.

{"text": "I first listened to Werewolves and Lollipops, and then went back and found Feeling Kinda Patton. I loved the former the first time through, and I still do. The latter took time to grow on me, but I've grown to love that one as well, though not as much as his sophomore effort. So when I heard he had a new comedy album coming out, I got really excited. But the product was a bit of a letdown. Patton Oswalt is a comic genius, and I don't say that lightly. Even jokes that I don't find funny have intelligent thought behind them, and that is, I think, what good comedy does, it draws you in and makes you wonder how a serious subject can be turned on its side and squeezed for it comedy value. A previous reviewer called this album \"Incosistent,\" and I agree. However, as with all forms of entertainment, what is completely the worst and un-funniest thing to me might just as easily get someone else to laugh til it hurts.It happens to all performers, and especially comedians, as big changes happen in their lives, especially when it comes to marriage and kids (some comedians even get away with talking EXCLUSIVELY about those two things). A lot more of this album is dedicated to talking about married life and not being able to drink scotch or smoke weed, as for me it isn't THAT funny, it's sort of a filler between the funnier bits (Text, Treadmill, and Orgy). Those are high points in album, sprinkled here and there with a funny observation, but overall it's a much weaker album to me than the two previous ones.I've talked about what doesn't work for me in the album, but I have to tag it with this, and it's something that hasn't happened with Patton yet: He doesn't reuse material to strengthen an album. And for that I applaud him. A lot of times comedians will try to strengthen their set by throwing in one or two jokes from a previous album, and it borders on tacky when it happens. But Patton Oswalt has yet to do this, and it hasn't gone unnoticed by me at least. It takes courage to get on stage and talk about the things that make you think and put a humorous slant on them. So in closing, I guess I can't really recommend this, but at the same time, it's not unfunny enough to tell someone to stay away from. But I guess depending on how much you align with the new direction he's taken, you will either really enjoy it or be left with an \"Eh\" feeling after listening to it.\n", "val": 0.00043024925980716944}
{"text": "First, I should say that I'm not as well versed in Patton's previous albums, but I've got \"The Comedians of Comedy\" DVD and \"Werewolves and Lollipops\" has shipped!  WOOT!  I've also listened to a LOT of his material on YouTube, a favorite being the KFC Famous Bowls and Oldest Woman to Give Birth bits that he did on an appearance on Conan O'Brien.I've watched \"No Reason To Complain\" quite a few times, and as funny as that performance is, it pales in comparison to \"My Weakness Is Strong.\"  I must have YouTubed this show at least a half dozen times after I found it, and further viewings have only deepened my appreciation and love for Patton's material, delivery and outlook.I'm shocked that anyone could suggest that this show is less entertaining than previous albums.  I wholeheartedly agree with ninjasuperstar.  Everything that has changed in Patton's life has made his material funnier.  For example, he used to joke about how he and his wife had agreed to have an invisible baby and name it \"10 hours of sleep a night\", but now she's going to trick him by leaving a trail of comic books into her va-jay-jay.  Nerd humor, my favorite!Now, with a baby girl on the way, he riffs about how if his daughter just inherits his looks and personality, her life will be \"a sheet cake made of victory and talking owls.\"  Out-effin'-standing!  The maturation of his humor through his life experience is evident and awesome.Anyone who can't find it funny is probably either afraid of getting older or thinks that drinking 'till you puke is a daily activity.Dave S.\n", "val": 0.0006132984417490661}
{"text": "Patton Oswalt dreaded morphing into the comic whose material becomes weak and clean after he gets sober, gets married, and has children.  If anything, sobriety (or near-sobriety), a wife, and a child have made Oswalt more funny.  He openly longs for Scotch and weed.  His reflections on the immaturity and perpetual boyhood it requires to choose those things over responsibility brings out more intelligent and poignant comedy than his drunker days.  That is, stability has sharpened rather than blunted Oswalt's comedy, and this album is his most refined thus far.\n", "val": 0.02084183320403099}
{"text": "Patton is a genius and that's all there is to say.  He seamlessly integrates a happy home life of wife and coming baby with tales of hilarious escapades, a grim outlook on humanity (that he's supposedly trying to improve), and future LSD trip worries.

{"text": "I think the same thing is happening to Patton Oswalt as happened to Guns N Roses, Alanis Morrissette, and many others.  When they were just on the cusp of becoming big, their work had a hungry edge to it.  But after getting millions of fans and as many dollars, their art became bloated, formulaic, and hackneyed.  Sad, but normal:  I'm not sure how a successful artist could prevent this from happening.About a year ago, almost by accident, I got my hands on a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Feelin-Kinda-Patton/dp/B0002BO0WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Feelin' Kinda Patton</a>&nbsp;and thought it was funny enough to warrant buying&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Werewolves-and-Lollipops-W-DVD/dp/B000RGSOM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Werewolves and Lollipops (W/DVD)</a>.  THAT one was so funny that I immediately became a Patton Oswalt fan, determined to follow his doings whenever I could.Alas!  This one, \"My Weakness is Strong,\" is the weakest of the three, I feel.  There's nothing here nearly as funny as \"p*ss drinkers\" or \"physics for poets.\"  It's not bad, but I only got a couple of laughs out of it.  If this had been the first one I started with, I certainly wouldn't have bought those others.\n", "val": 3.1431482057087123e-05}

{"text": "\"I gave it up\" is a fast-paced song explaining that he gave it up. All the old things in his life that were bringing him down and weighing on him.  \"I'm so into you\" is a sharp turn from \"I gave it up.\" He speaks about being so into God and needing more of Him. You can feel J. Moss's heart in this one. \"Restored\" has a nice beat flowing over awesome lyrics. I love the percussion arrangements in the background, \"Never rejected, just reconnected...I'm restored.\" The bridge in this song is CRAAAZYY!!! Wow! I think this is THE standout track on the album. Next, \"Anointing\" got me with a soulful and jazzy start and arrangement. He speaks about the anointing that cannot really be explained and the power that is in the anointing of God. Books, magazines, novelties and documentaries cannot explain \"the anointing.\"  Annointing also slightly reminded me of Coko's \"Endow me.\" Sweet Jesus can be explained just by the title. I loved when around 2:40 it got quiet and you felt where J was at in the past. When he was all alone in a pool full of tears. \"No More\" took me to a slight rock dimension, had some bouts of autotune. I think it's a great song and a great middle track for the album. On to \"God Happens\" the music was different. Different but brilliant.  I love this track, the lyrics are so true!  \"Friends will leave you out to dry but you will find that it works out in the nick of time because, God happens.\" On \"Holy One,\" musically I got a traditional gospel vibe. Again this track is self-explanatory. God is the Holy One. \"Rebuild,\" nice and peaceful; just how I love my songs. He speaks about being broken and asking God to rebuild Him. \"Just James,\" really reveals where James heart is. He explains that God is working on Him and he is just James.This album is about adoration and praise and worshipping the Most High God. Every track is different and he showed a variety of musical styles. You can understand the meaning behind the title of the album. He is simply just James, revealing his true heart. I didn't get complicated fancy melodies that were on his previous albums. No doubt I loved his other albums but sometimes you just want to really get to know the man without all trimmings. You get that on this one. You get James. Thank you J. Moss\n", "val": 0.03054565005004406}

I am so in shock at how NOT stellar this album is.  Now don't get me wrong, the annointing is on parts of the cd, and J is always the premier lyriciast and singer, but this album just doesn't do it for me at all.The albums starts out with Gave It Up, and J always starts his cd out with a banger, this one, was lack luster.  It lacked the normal fire J comes out the box with.  It was ok, but if you know how J comes out hard...this isn't it.  PAJAM, was either on vacation, having producers block, or plain trying something new with the production here and it sounds again very unispiring from track to track.  Yes there may be some praise and worship here, BUT, if he wanted to blow us away he would have been better suited giving us some live praise and worship with unedited annointing.  I was really grimacing through the album until I came upon the gem God Happens, which really spoke to me, so I know I will have this one on repeat.  He picks it up from here and continues with the next two tracks being pretty good and ends out with Just James, which didn't end the album on a high note for me either.Now I love me some J Moss to death and was so excited about going and getting this project,and I know artists will try new things, but this album left me feeling like he needed to go back in the studio and keep working for another couple months.  Better luck next time!\n", "val": 4.894327503279783e-05}

It's hard for me not to get caught into God's presence with that song. The first time I heard this song I was on the highway to work and I had to get myself together.At first I was kind of concerned that it only had 10 songs on the album (which at one time was common before CDs), but this album was worth it. He has definitely spiritually matured. This album will definitely be counted as one of my albums that I turn to when I need some spirituality with God. This album is kind of like a praise & worship CD but with a contemporary edge to it.I may add onto this review months later to see if it stands the test of time to confirm that it's just not good because it's new but because it's really anointed.\n", "val": 0.015442042611539364}

I appreciated the Collaborations, but thanks for being selfish this time J. And it was needed! This is just what I imagined. \"Sweet Jesus, Jesus\", I was so hungry for a longer rendition of this song from the previous CD, V2! \"I Love to Praise your name\"! Thanks so much J. When u listen to this track #5, be sure you can manage yourself if you are driving or on the job. You will definitely be taken there, in the presence of GOD, and you will react!  From track #1 it is on. Im like a kid with a new toy. I ran to Walmart this morning to get my toy!. On the real, J Moss has just flat let out there and by him just putting it out there like he has, he will help others whom face similar situations. Lord I need to be Restored sometimes daily, through out the day. That FLESH aint no JOKE! Just when u think u have managed it under control, BAM, here goes. But thank GOD for Restoration and his Annointing. I cant say enough how much I am so, so satisfied with this project. It will be a blessing to my husband and I! I cant wait for him to hear it! So I will definitely be copping the DVD and any concerts/praise and worship gatherings J Moss will be in near my area. J Moss, truly this is the  Deal of the Year. \"Holy One\", mercy, mercy. \"Rebuild Me\" .......All I can say is God has a mystical way of working out situations sometimes.

Probably my favorite song on this project...Just James is okay for me...sharing his testimony and being honest that God is still working on Him...the other songs were a blessing as well, I just prefer a bit more contemporary gospel, and would've liked to see J go somewhere different with this project (or at least stick to his guns) rather than combine the approaches of the J Moss Project and V2 to equal Just James.\n", "val": 0.02029590681195259}

{"text": "With his Album's  Thriller and Bad: most everyone knows that Michael Jackon helped define much  of The 80's Music  Scene but I consider his earlier youthful days as a Solo Artist and with The Jackson 5 to be of Equal Brilliance. Many of his Fans  don't realize that The Jackson 5's first Hit Song \"I Want You Back\" Topped The Pop and R&B Charts on October 7th 1969 which was just a few weeks after The Original 1969 Woodstock. On occasion: I will do some comparing to 1969's Woodstock On My Reviews because it was a Very Special Time For Music And That Event Will Never Be Duplicated!..... \"I Want You Back\" is just 1 of 19 Songs on This Disc. There is a Generous 65:45 (Sixty Five Minutes & Fourty Five Seconds) of Music on this Disc.Nine of these Songs is a very young Michael Jackson with the Jackson 5 and Ten of these Tunes is a very young Michael as a Solo Artist. There are Four Songs on this CD by The Jackson 5 that Charted #1 in both R&B and Pop and they are \"I Want You Back\", \"ABC\", \"The Love You Save\" and The Beautiful and Original \"I'll Be There\". There is also an Alternate Minus Mix Version of \"I'll Be There\" on this Compilation.....Other Huge Jackson 5 Hits here are `Never Can Say Goodbye\", \"Maybe Tomorrow\" and: Of Course: \"Dancing Machine'. Other Impressive Highlights here are Michael's Huge 70's Solo Hits \"Got To Be There\", Rockin Robin\", \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\"  and The Gorgeaus  \"Ben\".There is another Song by Michael on here I want to mention. It saw Radio Airplay in 1981 and I don't ever remember hearing it and it's called `One Day In Your Life\". It only reached #42 R&B and #55 Pop However: It was a #1 Chart Topper in The U.K. I can understand it being a Chart Topper because it is one of Michael's Beautiful Ballad's that  evidently got somewhat overlooked Domestically! I know I unfortunately missed it but I know about it now and it is a Gem!These Songs span from 1969-1984 and most of them are 70's material long before his \"Thriller\" days. This CD comes with a Standard Jewel Case and a Nice Booklet with a few Photos of a young Michael Jackson and the Liner Notes are also fairly generous. If you like The King Of Pop: This CD definitely needs to be in your Music  Collection! This is a relatively new 2009 Motown Records Package: and this CD and The Sound Qulity are Great! It doesn't seem possible this Young Man isn't with us anymore!.....RIP Michael\n", "val": 0.007386529352515936}

{"text": "Michael Jackson young and old had such soul in his music and brought happiness to his listeners of all ages.I especially like this CD because of the mix of the different songs from jackson 5 and when MJ went solo.My favorites are probably the first seven or eight, \"I want you Back\", \"ABC\", \"The Love you Save\", \"I'll be there\", \"Got to Be There\", \"Maybe Tomorrow\", \"Never can Say Goodbye\", \"Rockin Robin\" and after that in zeros in on Michael growing up with the songs like \"With a Child's Heart\", \"One day in your Life\", \"Farewell my Summer Love\" and others.I really like the Jackson 5's take on Smokey Robinson's Whos Lovin You. I listen to it all the time, it's one of my many favorites on this cd.Overall, Michael is a musical genius at any age and this CD is wonderful to have for anybody, all the songs are brilliant and show how wonderful of a singer Michael was when he was younger and how he still was today. His music is enjoyed by zillions of people of all ages and I think this CD is a perfect mix of MJ to have. This really is the Definitive Collection.RIP Michael Jackson\n", "val": 0.03337889909744263}

{"text": "I have heard other eminent pianists play these famous keyboard works by Bach.Some simply bored me stiff.Andras Schiff's Partitas, however, virtually fly out from the keyboard. So rhythmic, so lively, so crystal clear, and accoustically so outstanding.I've heard these works played (though not necessarily in full set) by many other Bach specialists.  I don't think Andras Schiff counts himself as one such, but without a single doubt, his reprise on ECM on this set of Bach Partitas rightfully sets him up as one of the most eminent Bach specialists of all times. His is the right temperament, fully nuanced, brilliantly articulated, and with full alertness to style and content.We do not need any 'period' instrument to high light the style in the case of such eminent interpretation. (I guess Schiff played them on a Borsendorfer).Well, if Schiff had earlier releases of Bach, his recent reprises certainly call for full attention from the musical world - they are nothing less than greatness itself!\n", "val": 0.03882791846990585}

And Andras Schiff--his first recording was so good it seemed redundant to record the partitas again, but I'm delighted he did. His phrasing highlights the structure of these works with a light touch, and he's found a rightness of tempo--especially as one movement relates to those before and after it. I tend to prefer historical instruments in baroque music, but Schiff succeeds in making the partitas utterly convincing on the piano. Too often, the ornaments that are tossed off effortlessly on a harpichord become feats of athleticism on the piano, but the trills, mordents and grace notes here succeed in embellishing the musical line without hi-jacking it.The notes state that this is a live recording, but you would never know it. It's note-perfect and there's not a peep from the audience. It's like stumbling upon a splendid acoustic space where a master pianist is playing for no-one but himself.\n", "val": 0.030789654701948166}

{"text": "i first want to echo the very positive sentiments of the other reviewers. the sound is extraordinarily good for a live recital, and emi has the uncanny engineering skill to mike an instrument at exactly the sweet spot where neither hall acoustics nor performance mechanisms (breathing, humming or instrument clatter) intrude on the music.these live performances are vigorous, alert, sharply contrasted, and clearly voiced (there is no hint of pedal). schiff's arrangement of the partitas to form a complete program or \"suite of suites\" is welcome and convincing.all that said, there is something about schiff's first traversal of the partitas, back in the 80's on london records, that is to me more unaffected, more alluring and, in effect, more humble. i do not really enjoy the aspect of modern pianism (native to the competitive, faddish and precarious environment of professional musicianship) which is expressed as a style of playing that amounts to \"look at how i can play the hell out of this music!\" there is a point where articulation, precision, contrast, ornamentation and clarity become ends in themselves, and to my ear there is plenty of that on display in this recital.on repeated listening i wearied of schiff's excessive use of a very crisp, somewhat loud, staccato or martello articulation (is this supposed to mimic a harpsichord?) in all except the slowest movements, his tendency to blur or ignore the tempo of ornamented textures or the concluding half of repeated sections (try tapping along the beat of the g major corrente or a minor gigue), his odd use of breathing pauses and abrupt dynamic changes to break the flow of brisk movements, and his preference to give both or all voices in two or three part textures an equal dynamic weight but contrasting affect (legato over staccato, contrasting ornamentation, etc.) as a kind of audible finger juggling stunt. (these are production mannerisms innovated by glenn gould, although schiff does not push them to the same extreme.)bach is already complex and profound enough: that is the assumption on which all interpretations should be framed. no secret sauce is required or appreciated. bach, not the pianist's stylizations or the pianist's fingers, should always be the focus of attention. on that account, i prefer schiff's immaculate first recording, and rank this mature recital, splendid as it is, second to the simplicity and sincerity of his youthful account.\n", "val": 0.0029681918676942587}
{"text": "Andrs Schiff has one of the finest reputations for performing Bach on the piano keyboard of any pianist today. Listening to the 2 CDs recorded immaculately from a live performance with the finesse we have come to expect from ECM is still an incredible experience, no matter how well the listener knows Schiff's way with Bach. These partitas are so carefully considered and executed that they seem like a series of connected thoughts or reveries in Schiff's mind and hands.'Partitas' simply means pieces for a solo instrument and by that definition there are no hard and fast rules about how they should be constructed (partitas gave way to the more 'academically correct' sonata, works again for solo instrument but that follow a constructed scheme of composition). Schiff's approach is one of respect of the many lines of invention that weave through the embellished core theme: his way with ornamentation is so assured and accurately executed that they truly to embroider the melodic lines and counter lines. How he is able to hold our attention through all six of these impossible difficult works is nothing short of amazing: the fact that they were recording during one performance almost defies credibility.In a time when contemporary composers are gallantly pushing all the borders of classical music to expand our concept of music in strange and wonderful new realms, it is refreshing to return to the crystalline clarity of Bach's music as an infusion of the basics in tonality, and who to better remind us of how magnificent these works are than Andrs Schiff!  This is a 'classic' performance that will surely remain a gold standard for many years.  Grady Harp, July 10\n", "val": 0.0512881800532341}

Some of the tracks are by Bon, but most are by Brian. The sound quality is great.The second one contains 14 tracks, all of which are by Brian and were recorded between 1991 and 2000, starting with High Voltage and ending with Safe in New York City.The DVDs:The Circus Krone DVD is awesome. It had a really fun audience (it was a small place, but the crowd's enthusiasm made it feel ten times bigger) and, of course, AC/DC sounded incredible. Some of the songs they chose to perform were surprising; I hadn't expected them to play Rock 'n' Roll Damnation, and Stiff Upper Lip isn't one you hear them perform often, either. For me, this DVD was one of the chief highlights of the set.The Family Jewels disc 3, in my opinion, wasn't great. It's mostly music videos (I much prefer live performances to music videos), 3 from Stiff Upper Lip, 3 from Ballbreaker, and a couple from Black Ice. There's also some alternate takes of some of the songs from the previous Family Jewels discs. Some of the material was great, but for myself, it felt a little redundant.The coffee table book:It's a hardcover, 164 page book containing photos of the band from 1974 onwards. It's mostly a picture book, but it also contains the occasional press clipping. The paper and photos are great quality.The memorabilia is: A button, a guitar pick, a poster, a flyer, a tattoo, a sticker, a bill of \"Money talks\" money, a studio track sheet, and three lithographs.The button is about 2 inches, and has a photo of Angus in the center with the words \"I do it for AC/DC\" written across the top. It was apparently their first ever piece of merchandise! Not much to say about the pick. It's a black pick with \"AC/DC\" written in the middle. The poster is a 2 foot by 3 foot Let There Be Rock tour poster. It's quite busy and colorful, and has Angus in the center. The flyer is a 1976 \"Lock Up Your Daughters\" tour flier printed on glossy paper. The tattoo's quite the laugh and is Bon's parrot tattoo with \"Dirty Deeds\" across the top, and \"Done Dirt Cheap\" across the bottom. The sticker is in the likeness of a school boy hat and is about 3 and a half inches by 2 and a half inches. The \"Money Talks\" money is a replica from their Razor's Edge tour and measures six and a half inches by 3 and a half inches. The track sheet is for Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and is made out of a sort of flexible, almost plastic-like material. As far as the lithographs, one of them is of Malcolm, one of Bon, and one of, well, the back of Harry and George's heads with Angus in the distance. The two of Malcolm and Bon are great, but the third one... anyway, the photos are printed on a heavy card-stock type material and would be great for framing. Everything is housed in a large envelope.The amp:I can't give a proper review of the amp seeing as I don't own a guitar, but some things of interest could perhaps be that the nobs on the front are placebos; you can't adjust the volume of the amp, or turn it on and off. The top part is the amp, and the bottom half is a very sturdy cardboard box. It's about 13 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 14 inches tall. The top doesn't snap onto the bottom, which is pretty inconvenient for carrying. You have to grip the box from the bottom, or the top will simply slide off.All things considered, it's a great collector's set. I highly recommend it.If anyone has any additional questions, feel free to leave a comment, and I'll do my best to answer it.\n", "val": 0.00029759283643215895}

{"text": "I've been looking for a CD of the Solfeggio frequencies for awhile now.  I think the cover is beautiful.  However, I am disappointed in the rest of the packaging.  For example, you cannot tell how many tracks there are on the CD.(There are nine tracks.)  Since none of the tracks are marked, you do not know what frequency each track is, how long each track is, what each track is for, etc.  I had to go to the website to print out the information so I would have that information.  If you purchase any other music CD, this sort of information is standard.I received the CD as promised on time.  Great service!\n", "val": 6.186703103594482e-05}

{"text": "This is a collection of 9 musical meditation tracks, supposedly based on 9 solfeggio tones, starting with 174 and ending with 963. The musical nature of the tracks made it difficult  to discern the specific tones in each, and while that was not critical for the effectiveness of the track, I felt that something seemed to be missing. I found them effective in assisting the change to altered states, and the musical nature was not at all distracting, even when there were definite drum beats. I found it easy to transition and float nicely with the music playing softly.I did not find it particularly useful for ambient sleep background, but your mileage may vary.The included cover art depicting 8 solfeggio frequencies arranged at the point of an 8 pointed star is very compelling and invites further study, sort of a cycle of 111s (the difference frequency of the solfeggio tones). I am sure there is much more here worthy of study.A well done set of musical meditation pieces.Recommended.\n", "val": 0.011864731088280678}
{"text": "I find these Solfeggio Harmonics really lovely and peaceful to listen to.  They help me to relax without even trying.  I tend to be somewhat hyper and putting them on for a few minutes while on break and at the end of a busy day stressful day really helps me to unwind.I prefer to listen with a good pair of stereo headphones and find it great to listen to while going to sleep and it easily sends me off to dreamland.  I would caution against listening to this while driving as it is so relaxing.I shopped around a lot on Amazon.com before buying the full set.  While I was reading reviews, I was listening to all different samples and these ended up being the ones that I gravitated to and kept playing over and over again.  I also own several other Solfeggio healing codes CD's (based on Len Horowitz's and Joseph Puleo's work).  This set is not intrusive, interweaves with my thought processes and helps me feel calm, centered, and happy.  I love music, but I often find it clashes with my thoughts and makes it hard to concentrate.  Not so with these harmonious sounds.  They meld with my thoughts and are there in the background without being too distracting.  I enjoy listening on my ipod while doing housework, reading, writing, etc.I tried to purchase the MP3's from Amazon but couldn't as I don't live in U.S.  So I went to the seller's website to buy them and ended up getting the wrong ones (Pure Tones) by mistake.  I emailed the seller \"Source Vibrations\" and they wrote back to me almost immediately letting me know they'd send me the right ones at no extra charge, which they emailed to me right away.  They even sent me a free MP3 \"Emerald Heart Ascendance\".The only suggestion I have for the seller would be to provide information on which tone resonates best with each chakra, so that I could put them in that order (lowest to highest chakra) to use for chakra work.Listen to the samples and buy them if you like them, you won't regret it!\n", "val": 0.004519435111433268}

{"text": "These are beautiful tones. Cellular resonation very good. Results in stress release, cellular/energy balancing, promoting health through the balance of vibration, tone and frequency.This is more than just listening to music. This enhances your bodies natural vibration at 528hz; totally misaligned by the bombardment of EMF frequencies and the white noise of marketing, vehicles, LIFE.Highly recommended. Can't beat the price for what you get. Compared to medical costs, Source Vibrations is pennies on the dollar.ADDITIONAL NOTE:BE AWARE: once you attune yourself to the Solfeggio scale listening to most other music becomes challenged. This is because the Solfeggio scale is an ancient sound system based upon six tones: Ut RE MI FA SOL LA, unlike todays music chaotic in the 12 tone temperament scale. Solfeggio brings peace, harmony, balance, health. The temperament tones encourage chaos, confusion, illness. Once it was realized how Solfeggio 'liberated' people from controlling interests the Solfeggio scale was replaced.Originally all the Psalms and the Hymn of St. John were Solfeggio. Most East Indian music is tuned to Solfeggio and a lot of Celtic music as well. Rock n' Roll, metal ... well, all you have to do is look around at the confusion and chaos of the nations: disease rampant world-wide.This is one reason Solfeggio Tuning/music is so important. It is a baby step in bringing our body/body systems back to their 528hz, our norm vibration: returning our energy and cellular systems catapulted into the fight or flight mode back into a harmonic frequency.

I tuned in to the station in the middle of his \"Amazing Grace\" rendition and was captivated by the song's haunting beauty. I kept listening to his interview hoping to catch the name of the artist to look up later. They finally it as he went into \"Right in Front of Me\". I started to cry while listening to it. Those two songs alone are worth buying this CD. Of course all the others are wonderful too, but those two have a powerful message and wonderful music. I ordered both this CD and his first, \"Trying to Fit the Ocean in a Cup\" as soon as I got home. If you are searching for God or just need a little reminding that we are not alone, you'll love this CD. I can't wait to hear what he comes out with next.\n", "val": 0.03792602941393852}

{"text": "I got and fell in love with Josh Wilson's debut CD last year, so when he released his short follow up, I had to get it.  It is only seven tracks long, but it's also much cheaper than a full length CD, so it all evens out.  And the songs here are well worth getting.The CD actually opens with the Christmas influenced \"Sing.\"  It was actually part of an MP3 release he did last Christmas.  But the song works well for the entire year.  The song is a praise song to the God who has saved us, but also a reminder of how much we needed Him to save us.  It's a nice mid tempo track that will get stuck in your head.  Trust me, you won't mind.The title is pulled from the next song, \"Before the Morning.\"  It's a pop ballad written to someone dealing with the struggles in life, reminding them that God is still there and will bring them through this challenge.\"Listen\" and \"How to Fall\" are the upbeat tracks of the disc.  The first is a very honest admission that he needs to listen to God more.  The second is a very fun love song.\"Do You Want to Know\" is really the only track I don't love here, but I have a feeling that is because it convicts me.  The slower song is about the needs we overlook daily as we go about our lives.\"Right in Front of Me\" is another slow song as Josh pleads with God for some proof to help ground his faith.  It's a very honest song, and I identify with it more than I should.The disc ends with a dueling guitar instrumental version of \"Amazing Grace.\"  It's very well done and great to listen to.I always love it when a new artist releases a great second disc, and that's the case here.  Josh's lyrics are still sharp and identifiable.  There is a hint of rock in his pop/folk music that will continue to appeal to the fans he made with his first release.  And if you are looking for a great new artist to try, look no further.\n", "val": 0.022983504459261894}

The price was a bargain for three LPs. I listened to the sample tracks and I decided to order it. This collection has become an instant favorite of mine to listen to as well. Each of these guys are incredibly talented. Their music has a good blend of heavy guitar licks, solid percusion and a wide range of vocals. Other favorite bands of mine include POD, Flyleaf, Skillet, Hawk Nelson, Brian \"Head\" Welch, Kutless, Familiy Force 5 and now TFK. I give this a five star rating for the value and quality of music. Order this set and you won't be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.020557614043354988}

This version is not. A pleasant surprise.  The Rehab song was never high on my list, this version is enjoyable.  My favorite cut on the cd is the Stevie Wonder Medley, which was done superbly.  This CD with its rich harmonies to well known songs is a must for your collection.  Buy it, you'll love it.\n", "val": 0.023788396269083023}
{"text": "While waiting impatiently for their next holiday album, I was delighted to see that Straight No Chaser had released an EP.  I listened to the samples, then downloaded the entire group of songs.  They've been playing on rotation all evening, and I still can't get enough of a couple of them.The good:  The harmonies are tight, music is lovely, and the songs \"I'm Yours/Somewhere Over The Rainbow\" and \"Signed, Sealed, and Delivered\" are absolutely delightful.  I've never heard a version of \"Rainbow\" that I've liked--even Judy Garland sounded sappy, IMHO--but this was a pleasant surprise.  \"You Send Me\" and \"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\" are charming, and a joy to listen to, although they don't sparkle quite as much as the other two songs I mentioned. They're still excellent, and I'd love to see them performed live, I was just hoping for something that had more snap.The bad:  \"Rehab\" was surprisingly flat, for Straight No Chaser.  It's very well done, but I expected it to be more exuberant.  \"Man Who Can't Be Moved\" is truly beautiful, it's just bloody sad, and after a few listens, I clicked it off on the iPod lineup.  For those not looking for peppy happy music, you'll love it.Conclusion:  The entire EP is well worth purchasing, this is the Straight No Chaser that we all fell in love with, and it's enough of their gorgeous sound in a non-holiday format to keep fans happy until their next album, Christmas Cheers, comes out.  Some of the songs are mellower than the fan favorite \"Twelve Days of Christmas\", but they're all very good. Buy it, you won't regret it!\n", "val": 0.017380187287926674}

{"text": "Straight No Chaser has enjoyed considerable success; and it's albums like this one that show why they're well respected. The CD is short but these numbers shine brighter than silver and gold combined; these men sing remarkably well. The quality of the sound is excellent and that artwork is great.The album opens with a stunning treatment of Amy Winehouse's \"Rehab.\" \"Rehab\" gets the royal treatment from these fine artists and I think Amy would approve of their version of her song! Straight No Chaser uses their excellent technique of balancing members who are harmonizing with others singing the principal lyrics to the song; and thus it all holds its own very well. \"I'm Yours\" sounds quite good when Straight No Chaser tackles it; their version of Jason Mraz's tune sounds just fine and when they go into \"Over the Rainbow\" the medley becomes truly very memorable.\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\" gets a fine arrangement and the members of Straight No Chaser never let go of a single superfluous note. I'm impressed. There's also a very good medley of \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" and \"I Was Made to Love Her;\" they make \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" flow very smoothly into \"I Was Made to Love Her\" and this track is one of my favorites on this album. That's a fine mini-salute to Stevie Wonder there!\"You Send Me\" is easy on the ear and that doo wop flavor really enhances this ballad. The CD closes with Straight No Chaser performing a Frankie Valli song, \"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You.\" This romantic, classic love song shines like silver and gold in their capable hands.Straight No Chaser turned out an excellent set of songs for this Amazon exclusive CD; I would highly recommend this for their fans.

{"text": "Expectations were very high for this new CD, more than three decades after the first opus titled The Blue Ridge Rangers&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Blue-Ridge-Rangers/dp/B000000XC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Blue Ridge Rangers</a>. Let's be clear: John Fogerty is far superior compared to any contemporary artist and in my view ranks among the Top 10 All-time best songwriter and arranger in the USA. This new CD proves and confirms it again. What was groundbreaking with the 1973 The Blue Ridge Rangers was that he selected standards in various fields (country western, but also bluegrass, spirituals like \"Someone Listening for My Name\") and revisited them with a tasty rock sauce, which was unusual and innovative back in the 1970s. It was then a kind of hybrid CW album made for rock audiences by one of the greatest rockers of music history. Another thing is that John played all instruments, including his very powerful, rockin' drumming (for example on \"Jambalaya\" and \"Hearts of Stone\").Here, in 2009, we get very good songs and excellent interpretations (hence the four stars), John still sings perfectly well, helped by very good musicians; but there are few elements that are as innovative as the first one, which in my view still deserves its five stars even after so many years. Therefore, if I cannot give as much to this brand new one as the first one, I would nevertheless count until four stars for \"Rides Again\".Among many great moments, the duet with Bruce Springsteen is outstanding, and John's compositions are great; on the other hand, the weakest piece remains \"Never Ending Song of Love\".I know comparisons are often unfair, but even the CD's title invites us to the comparison with the original one. One thing is sure: those who like this \"Rides Again\" will certainly love the first CD by The Blue Ridge Rangers, which was then 100% John Fogerty, and remains a masterpiece.\n", "val": 0.03080063872039318}

Would it be able to live up to its namesake? The original focused on roots country and a touch of gospel, delivering a classic equal to the legacy of CCR. (Creedence fans unfamiliar with that album will be exhilarated to discover that priceless little gem tucked away in Fogerty's catalog.)This new release brings the timeline up to, more or less, the seventies, where Fogerty pays tribute to many of his favorites. Right off the bat, if you're just looking for a couple downloads, he knocks \"Haunted House\" right out of the park. In looking at the song titles I thought it might be the old Loretta Lynn weeper but this is the Jumpin' Gene Simmons song that appears on so many Halloween compilations. The audio sample doesn't do this justice; it belongs in Fogerty's top tier right next to covers like \"I Put A Spell On You\".So many others could be selected for individual download. A quick guideline for sampling first might include \"Paradise\", \"I Don't Care\", \"I'll Be There\", \"Fallin' Fallin' Fallin'\" and the ominous Fogerty original, \"Change In The Weather\". I wasn't a big fan of John Denver's quavering voice so Fogerty's rendition of \"Back Home Again\" really, so to speak, brings this one home for me.\"Moody River\" is one of those late 50's - early 60's death songs that were so prevalent back then. Pat Boone has been unfairly maligned as time has passed since he wasn't rock and roll, but by old school pop standards he was an impressive vocalist. Fogerty makes the song grittier than the original but this particular death song has a peppy hook similar to Brook Benton's \"Boll Weevil Song\" that just subverts the darker edges of this song.Stylistically the Blue Ridge Rangers span the gap between rock and 1960's era country. If you haven't picked up a John Fogerty album since&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Centerfield/dp/B002KOOHCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Centerfield</a>&nbsp;and the song samples pass your taste test I'd recommend the album as a whole rather than just select downloads.\n", "val": 0.0030476367101073265}
{"text": "THE BLUE RIDGE RANGERS RIDES AGAIN has quite a few flaws (starting with the tongue-twisting, grammar-defying title): much of the song selection is ho-hum (John Denver?  Really?); the arrangements are often uninspired (\"Never Ending Song of Love\" sounds just like every other country-tinged bluegrass love song); and even Fogerty himself tends to slack off a bit here and there.But you should still listen to this album.  Why?  Because, despite its flaws, there are still a few career-defining moments here.  Fogerty's take on \"Haunted House\" is truly inspired; as is his collaboration with the Boss on \"When Will I Be Loved\" (talk about a final double-whammy).  His duet (can I call it that?) with Don Henley and Timothy Schmidt on \"Garden Party\" plays out like a sixties/seventies country-rock wet dream (the Eagles and CCR collide; it's just as amazing as you would expect).The problem is, Fogerty never really sounds like himself.  I have yet to hear the original BLUE RIDGE RANGERS album; it was on my shopping list at one point, but got knocked aside for whatever reasons.  I still intend to purchase it; John Fogerty is a musical icon, a true rock/country legend who deserves every bit of respect (and, yes, disrespect) he's garnered.  But THE BLUE RIDGE RANGERS RIDES AGAIN just doesn't sound much like a Fogerty record; we get the lovable, happily-married guy on a few tracks, and he sounds genuinely blissful (bliss is boring, as the rock adage goes), but we don't get much of the angry rocker; he comes close on John Prine's \"Paradise,\" though he gives the tune a more up-tempo melody than it necessitates (check out Johnny Cash's PERSONAL FILE for a very haunting version of the tune).  Still, it's nice to hear Fogerty's take on the classic; and it's nice to hear his interpretations of all these songs.  The record is heavily flawed in spots, but when it shines, it's blinding.  If you're a fan of Fogerty or CCR, you need to pick up a copy of this album.  If you're new to the man, you might want to start elsewhere and work your way back here.\n", "val": 0.003264349652454257}

Schmit (the Eagles) and Bruce Springsteen on selected tracks. The production, engineering, and mastering, both on the LP, as well as the CD were quite good, the latter done by the incomparable Bob Ludwig (one of the best!) resulting in very good sonics, though perhaps not quite 'audiophile' quality.

{"text": "This album plays like an album, and it just flows. This sounds like the country music I grew up with, it sounds like the country music of the 1970s and early 1980s. Quite frankly, in an era when country has pretty much become substitute rock, it is quite refreshing. It's the best new album I've bought made in the 2000s.Now let me explain that I'm fickle when it comes to music. I very rarely like an entire album. An example would be Tom Petty's \"Full Moon Fever\"....I like every song on that album except for \"Alright For Now\". Albums don't tend to flow right anymore, unl;ike classics like \"Hair Of The Dog\" by Nazareth or \"Appetite For Destruction\" by Guns N' Roses, which are two albums I can listen from start to finish without skipping tracks constantly.Now onto this album. I've never heard the song \"Paradise\" before, but every song on this album is a cover. Fogerty does the song in a way that makes me like it, and it's a great song lyrics. Fogerty then does the best version I've ever heard of \"Never Ending Song Of Love\". It's a song I've heard most of my life never knowing its name or who did it, but it was always a fun listen-and Fogerty's version makes you stand and take notice, and maybe sing along and dance.The cover of Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party\" is a very good rendition, and is very comparable to the original. On the DVD that comes with the CD John explains why he chose that song, and his hesitancy to do a few of these covers and how surprised he was that they worked so well. He has a great admiration for these songs, and it shows. It's great to hear a musician's point of view on that introspective song of \"Garden Party\".\"I Don't Care (As Long As You Love Me)\" captures the spirit and essence of Buck Owens, and I have a feeling that only John can pull off great covers of Buck's work. I know Dwight Yoakum's tried, but his covers usually seem a bit off somehow.I've never heard the original \"Back Home Again\" by John Denver. On the DVD John tells a good Farm Aid story about this song and seeing John Denver there. It's very rustic, rural, and rootsy. The whole album is great for a sunny afternoon, or a beautiful lazy sun stripped morning like it is right now as I type.Gonna skip a few tracks here. \"Heaven's Just A Sin Away\" is a song by the Kendalls I've heard a lot, my dad used to play it quite often the last couple years before he died. John does a very good version, his vocal range hits the vocals just right. Plus, if you've never heard the Kendalls they're female vocalists, and a guy covering a female vocal can be tricky, but he pulls it off.\"Fallin', Fallin', Fallin'\" is a great song as sung by John Fogerty. Unsure who did the original, but this track is superb. Then comes the cover of \"Haunted House\" by Gene Simmons (not the Kiss lead singer). I don't think I've ever heard a country version of it before, only other cover I've heard was done by Sam the Sham & The Pharoahs. John's version has some good twang to it. Classic country instrumentation on the track is the kinda stuff modern country just won't touch anymore. This stuff is the real deal of country music.\"When Will I Be Loved\" is a classic. First done by the Everly Brothers, it was famously covered by Linda Rondstadt. Here John Fogerty & Bruce Springsteen get it more than right, they bring it on home and deliver like nobody's business.This is the secret gem that should be in everybody's collection.\n", "val": 0.05104060098528862}

This time he's not playing all the parts, musically or vocally.  He's got some very good help.  I'll have to admit limited knowledge of his solo career.  My brother, a big Creedence fan, had the 45 of Jambalaya from the original Blue Ridge Raiders LP.  Check out my Orangehornet57 storefront and find a cassette of Centerfield.  But he's still sounding good after all these years.  This CD has some interesting choices. There are even a few connections.  We get a Buck Owens song. Rick Nelson's Stone Canyon Band featured Owens' former steel player, Tom Brumley. John sounds fine on Garden Party.  But that song was very personal. He and Don Henley could have substituted Creedence or Eagles songs in the lyrics.  Fogerty's take on John Denver's Back Home Again was excellent.  A very surprising choice was Moody River.  It's one of my favorite Pat Boone.  That refrain matches the haunting lyrics. Hearing it with guitar instead of piano was a little strange.  Some songs I wasn't familar with before.  But there's one I really wished he'd left off.  Heaven's Just A Sin Away was one of the worst country songs of the late 70s. I found the lyrics very offensive.  The Kendalls weren't one of my favorite duos either.  I still think they did one of the worst covers of Leavin' On A Jet Plane.  John also sings with the Boss!  Everly Brothers songs remain excellent choices for duos.  The video for When Will I Be Loved showed some guys having fun.  You can hear that on the CD.  I'd be very surprised if John Fogerty ever sees this review.  But just in case, I want to say hi.  Also, life is too short. Make peace with Stu and Cosmo.

Being of an older generation, he never heard of Fogerty so this was a whole new sound for him.  He also gives it a thumbs up!\n", "val": 0.04953126236796379}
{"text": "I will try to give a track-by-track analysis later, but first I would like to tell you why I buy John Fogerty albums. There are really three reasons: 1) he is one of the best songwriters around 2) the voice and 3) he is one of my favorite guitar players.I knew going in that this was a collection of covers and therefore accepted the fact that his songwriting was missing (and that was never really an issue anyway, because Fogerty has always been great at covering others, going back to the CCR days). His voice is great as usual, but what about the guitar? Unfortunately, John Fogerty, the man behind CCR and the writer of numerous songs that only the best guitar players can play decently, does not play lead guitar on a single track on this disc.After I got over that initial disappointment, I realized that I still had a fine collection of covers here and, as a bonus, one original.\"Paradise\" kicks things off here and it showcases Fogerty doing what he does best: commenting on a social issue (in this case, strip mining) in his scathing, straightforward manner. I can certainly see why he chose this song.I have always found the song \"Never Ending Song of Love\" to be mildly annoying, so while Fogerty's version is the best I've heard, I would have been happier if he had found an alternative.\"Garden Party\" is the masterpiece of Rick Nelson and Fogerty clearly could not equal the original. So he doesn't attempt to, instead giving a very heartfelt, tribute-like reading of the tune with the help of Don Henly and Timothy B. Schmidt of the Eagles.\"Back Home Again\" is a John Denver song that Fogerty does a wonderful, heartfelt version of.\"I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)\" is a Ray Price tune which Fogerty and the band give a rousing performance of. This is classic Fogerty and one of the best tracks on the album.\"Change in the Weather\" is the only original here and is actually a re-recording of a song from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Eye-of-the-Zombie/dp/B00005B7FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eye of the Zombie</a>. This version is much better an is the closest to the classic Fogerty/CCR sound that we get on the album, although a fiddle is prominent on the track and try as he may, Buddy Miller is no Fogerty when it comes to guitar.\"Moody River\" is a dark ballad about a woman who commits suicide. I could see this as a CCR album track in the spirit of \"I Put a Spell on You\" but much, much more subdued.\"Heaven's Just a Sin Away\" is one of my favorites on the album, mostly because you can tell that Fogerty had a blast doing it.I didn't particularly care for \"Fallin' Fallin' Fallin'\"\"Haunted House\" is possibly the best track on the album, although it does not come near the original. It has a good, jam session vibe to it that I really like.\"When Will I Be Loved\" is an Everly Brothers song sung as a duet with Bruce Springsteen. Obviously, Springsteen's voice doesn't quite fit with smooth, slow Everly Brothers harmony, so they smartly speed the song up and sing harmony only on the chorus.In conclusion, fans will probably enjoy this, but it may be something of a turnoff for those who are not already fans and who may have heard about the Fogerty legend and his place in history as one of the great songwriters and guitarists in the history of rock.

{"text": "I looked forward to this CD release and when it arrived I was very happy with the sound. It is a good collection of country cover songs. These songs really agree with John Fogerty`s voice as it is these days. The version of *Moody River sounds like it is right out of the 50`s or 60`s,and he has made it his own now I think.I like the way he and the band cover most the other tunes on the CD,but *Change In The Weather sounds out of place here. It also could have used a lead guitar solo. I would have given this CD 5 stars if not for that tune. No John Fogerty did not play all the instruments on this Blue Ridge Rangers album. He stopped doing that after Centerfield. He now has a great band and this time he let them be the other rangers. He included *Garden Party by Ricky Nelson and the words to that song probably express the way Fogerty felt about this release.The price was right on this CD I pre-ordered my copy.

{"text": "This second round with the Blue Ridge Rangers / John Fogerty is probably largely as one would expect it. Very accomplished and well-played! What it needs is perhaps a few more surprises. The traditional country are largely allowed to draw the picture. The song choice is probably okay; a mixture of well-known standards and a few more obscure country songs, but in either case the arrangements contain few surprises.The album opens well with John Prine's \"Paradise\", which probably has all a good classic country song should.  Among the following songs Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party\" definitely is a number that deserves to be revisited; unfortunately the arrangement is so faithfull to Nelson's original that experiment almost seems superfluous.Actually I first really woke up when the tones of track 7th were to be heard. Where was it I'd heard this song before?? - Oh, yes. . It was Fogerty's own \"Change in the Weather\" from the overlooked album \"Eye of the Zombie\". Definitely one of this album's highlights and more \"CCR\" than the original version, which is also very good.\"Moody River\" was a nice beat, and it is altogether a fine melancholy tune.The final track is Everly Brothers' \"When Will I Be Loved\", which is one of the few songs which has really been given a different treatment - a more rocking arrangement, and with a surprise guest vocal by Bruce Springsteen.All in all a solid album from Fogerty, which however, contains only few surprises.\n", "val": 0.016902275383472443}

{"text": "When I heard that John Fogerty was working on a sequel to 1973's Blue Ridge Rangers album, I was delighted - particularly when I saw the track listing. I couldn't help but play what I thought the album would sound like in my head, and I was both surprised and satisfied when I eventually heard the album and found it contradicted my imaginary playback. It just goes to show that John Fogerty is seldom predictable. The decision to thematically revisit his early '70s classic album (of already classic songs) is a strange one in itself, as he was artistically back on form with 2007's fantastic Revival, which not only hinted at his early days as a rock icon but simultaneously positioned him as a contemporary force to be reckoned with.One of the most immediate differences between this and the original Blue Ridge album is that whereas all the instruments on the first one were played by Fogerty himself (like McCartney on his first solo outings), the sequel is most definitely a band album, as all honky tonk records should be (case in point: Mark Chesnutt's Savin' the Honky Tonk). Amazingly, as Fogerty wanted to distance himself from the CCR legacy at the time of the first record, this is the first of the two to be put out under his own name.Slipping his latest disc into the player, many highlights jump out and assault the listener between the eyes (or as that between the ears?), the first of which would probably be \"Never Ending Song of Love.\" The opener, \"Paradise,\" didn't really cut it for me, but then again I didn't particularly enjoy the John Prine original either.Fogerty's decision to cover Rick(y) Nelson's \"Garden Party\" is especially interesting. Nelson wrote the song in 1972 about a Madison Square Garden audience's apparent displeasure when he performed his newer, country-styled music instead of his '50s rock `n' roll hits. The theme likely resonates with Fogerty as he continually tries to strike the right balance between Creedence hits and solo numbers in his live shows.It is my view that nobody, with the possible exception of Dwight Yoakam, should attempt to cover Buck Owens. Buck's songs are so identifiable right from the start that you expect to hear his voice, and anybody else's pales in comparison. I had this problem with Tanya Tucker and Jim Lauderdale's recent \"Love's Gonna Live Here,\" and my apprehension resurfaced - and, unfortunately, didn't subside - when I heard Fogerty's take on Buck's 1964 hit \"I Don't Care (Just As Long As You Love Me).\" You can tackle No-Show, or even the Hag, but leave Buck to Dwight.\"I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)\" has to be one of the greatest country songs of them all. Ray Price did a superb job of it back in 1957, but contrary to my opinion on Buck Owens covers, this song always seems to sound fantastic regardless of who's singing it. Heather Myles did it well a few years ago, and Fogerty does it justice here. The fiddle intro is as unbeatable as always, and just try not to sing along to that chorus!Fogerty's sole writing credit on this disc is for \"Change in the Weather,\" which sounds to my ears like a John Rich song (but don't tell him I said so!) Although the title line is repetitive to the extreme, it does pack a punch. Still, this song probably won't survive the repeat listens the rest of the album deserves.As with \"I'll Be There,\" \"Heaven's Just a Sin Away\" is the kind of jaunty, melodious tunes that anyone could make sound good - even plastered buskers - and this version is no exception. Kelly Willis did a fine rendition, but Fogerty gives her a run for her money. The next track is \"Fallin' Fallin' Fallin',\" and it too is given an incredible reading, confirming this album as a terrific showcase for traditional country music - a fact all the more amazing when one considers that John Fogerty isn't even known as a country singer. The album closes with The Boss joining Fogerty on The Everlys Brothers' 1960 classic \"When Will I Be Loved.\" Both do a great job and sound like they're having a blast, bringing the album to a fine honky tonkin' finish.It may sound clich to say it, but I hope it's not another 30+ years until the next one.\n", "val": 0.013782572001218796}

{"text": "I ordered this CD after hearing John Fogerty perform the old Everly Brothers/Linda Ronstadt classic 'When Will I Be Loved' on the David Letterman show. I like this album from the standpoint that Fogerty chose to perform old traditional type Country songs which he put his personal touch to plus he surrounded himself with some top shelf musicians. You will be hard pressed to find a better steel guitarist (Greg Leisz) and violinist/fiddle player (Jason Mowery - the best I've heard this side of Soozy Tyrell of the Bruce Springsteen Sessions Band, Sharon Corr of The Corrs, and Mairead Nesbitt of Celtic Woman) than those on this album. This CD is likeable if you like the old traditional Country standards but may not be preferred by someone who likes the current Country scene. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What I really like most about this album is that it is ... DIFFERENT.  My favorite song on this album is 'Never Ending Song Of Love' which was originally written by Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett (who also played with Eric Clapton and were instrumental in getting Clapton's solo career started) in the early 1970's. John Fogerty not only nailed this song clean but he actually enhanced it by adding a steel guitar and fiddle/violin to the instruments which gave it a 'Country' feel and therefore crossed the boundary from Folk/Rock to Country. 'Heaven's Just a Sin Away' is a real nice catchy tune which stays in your mind and is one that you will repeatedly sing to yourself. On 'Change in the Weather' John Fogerty puts his best down home soulful blues hat on and brings it on home. Other songs such as 'I Don't Care', 'I'll Be There', 'Fallin' Fallin' Fallin' ', 'Haunted House' are Honky Tonk Classics that will have you in Hee-Haw Heaven! This Fogerty album is real good and flows real well from top to bottom and is currently #1 on my personal listening list which is quite diverse (Rock, Soul, Irish/Celtic, Jazz, Classical, 50's, some Country, etc.). He did a masterful job with these old classic songs.  Put on your cowboy/cowgirl hat plus your boots for this album is 100% Hillbilly Honky Tonk which you will absolutely love.

Well, this was worth waiting for.  A stonking set from start to finish.  From the opening track \"Paradise\" to the last, a cover of the Everly Brothers' When Will I Be Loved, this is a gem.  I'd never have expected \"Never Ending Song Of Love\" to be recorded by any credible artist but the only thing this has in common with the New Seekers is the lyrics.  Brilliant.  Full justice is done to the late Rick Nelson's autobiographical Garden Party, Pat Boone's cringeworthy Moody River is transformed.  I've got five different versions of Haunted House already but this one's as good as any (well perhaps Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs just shade it).  I thought only Dwight Yoakam (and Buck of course!)could do a decent job of a Buck Owens song but JF does great on I Don't Care (Just As Long As You Love Me) yet for me the standout track on a superb set is Heaven's Just A Sin Away.  Worth double the price for this track alone.  I've played it so much already, if this was a vinyl album it would be worn out by now.

{"text": "I purchased the original LP of the Blue Ridge Rangers on release in 1973 just as all my old CCR LPs were beginning to show the wear of so much playing after the sad demise of CCR. The post break up issued of live LPs plus the last group release of \"Mardi Gras\" had proved so disappointing but that 1973 release just blew me away! A full shift into country and gospel music that had only featured in odd tracks on prior CCR releases but what hit you most was the sheer love and craftmanship that had gone into it. 30 plus years on I still listen to it a lot as a very unique one off and the high quality of the overall musicianship, though no credits were ever given to any other musicians involved.36 years on and John's revisiting of this area after seeing him several times live on tour in recent years was definitely an interesting step. Sadly, the 2009 mock cover of the original 1973 release probably sets the tone overall too well. While the performances are fine the truth is they are mostly just not that great in moving or exciting you. The whole feel is of a crew of very high class quality pickers just having a stroll and a good time in the studio. The overall choice of songs also seems a bit perverse - Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party\" and the Everly's \"When will I be loved\" benefit little versus the originals despite the esteemed star company present on each and seem out of place.  The very blue collar feel to the overall choice of songs on the original has not been reflected or well replaced in the selection on display here.The real disappointment though is Fogerty's overall performance. The lack of tightness in parts of his vocal interpretations especially and a feeling that none of the musicians are stretching themsleves possibly shows a lack of the control freak he is often accused of being in not wasting a second or note on any recording.Like all long time CCR/Fogerty fans I am sure I will listen to this regularly but just doubt it will be anywhere near as often as the original source release.\n", "val": 0.00011773914593504742}

It's his first release that seems more motivated by commerce than art and an uncharacteristic triumph of form over substance.  His art director wife seems to have contributed more to the project than John himself.There's just not much of Fogerty on this album of covers.  Compared to the original Blue Ridge Rangers album, where John played all the instruments and sang all the parts, this album has him lending lead vocals and some background acoustic guitar parts and leaving the heavy lifting to a crew of young hired guns.The production is crisp, but the singing and arrangements bring little new to the material.  The cover here of \"When Will I Be Loved,\" for example, yields nothing that the Everly Brothers, the originators, or the great Linda Ronstadt haven't already.And why in the world do we need a countrified version of John's own \"Change in the Weather\"?John is important in rock & roll because of his songwriting, his singing, and his guitar playing, in that order.  Unfortunately, only one in three of those roles is spotlighted here, and for anyone but the most rabid Fogerty fans, that's not enough.Apparently he finds it very painful these days to write new songs, although he clearly still has the ability, as the excellent \"Don't You Wish It Was True\" on \"Revival\" proved beyond doubt.  One hopes that it's not too late for him to exorcise the demons that have caused him to equate songwriting with getting ripped off by a wide variety of parasites and rediscover the joy of creating the simple but unforgettable songs for which he is justifiably famous.Until or unless that happens, he might as well devote himself to raising his kids as best he can, preferably giving them love rather than money earned from fans deserving better than this listless effort.\n", "val": 0.00015544828784186393}

Each Fogerty album is an experiment with something new. I have no expectations for history repeating when I listen to Fogerty, and there's just something about his music that's always solid.\"The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again\" introduced some new songs and artists that I otherwise would have never listened to. Now I know John Prine has been around since 1971, but I had never listened to anything from him, and I could not for the life of me name any songs from him either. \"Paradise\" is a well written song, and I like how Fogerty plays it. I also had heard the name Bonnie & Delany but never listened to them either. I can't say that I am a big fan of \"Never Ending Song Of Love\". It seemed rather one note to me. I am familiar with Rick Nelson's 1972 hit \"Garden Party\" and I think this is one of Fogerty's finest interpretations here. Superbly performed with Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmidt. I might even like it better than Rick Nelson's version! I had never heard of Buck Owens, nor had I heard \"I Don't Care (Just As Long As You Love Me)\". I can't say that I am a fan. Again, a rather one note song. I am very familiar with John Denver's \"Back Home Again\", and try as I might, I found Fogerty's version lacking. You really can't touch John Denver. He brought something very special to his music, and he was one of a kind. Fogerty does a serviceable job with it, it's just nothing special. I had never heard of Ray Price or \"I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)\", and I must say that I like Fogerty's choice, and it piqued my interest in Price.I don't know what to make of Fogerty doing Fogerty on a revision of \"Change In The Weather\" from his 1986 \"Eye Of The Zombie\" album. I've always liked the song to begin with, and this new version didn't really add or subtract anything from the original version. I like the original better. I know who Pat Boone is, but I never listened to his music, but \"Moody River\" is one of the highlights here. Fogerty does a great job with this song, and it's a well written piece. It's surprising to me that in 1961 this song was a hit considering the subject matter. I had never heard of The Kendalls or their 1977 song \"Heaven's Just A Sin Away\", and I thought it was pleasant, but nothing special here. Another Ray Price song, \"Falling Falling Falling\" was okay, not great. Jumpin' Gene Simmons' 1964 hit \"Haunted House\" was just okay. I know Fogerty and Springsteen singing together for the first time on The Everly Brothers 1960 hit \"When Will I Be Loved\" was supposed to be a main draw here, and I like all three artists, but this comes across overdone.So, a three and a half star album. Above average, but not quite great. Here's how this compares to Fogerty's back catalog:1968 Creedence Clearwater Revival: Three Stars1969 Born On The Bayou: Three and a Half Stars1969 Green River: Five Stars1969 Willie And The Poor Boys: Five Stars1970 Cosmo's Factory: Four Stars1970 Pendulum: Three and a Half Stars1972 Mardi Gras: One Star1973 The Blue Ridge Rangers: Three and a Half Stars1975 John Fogerty: Out Of Print! Someone please remaster and reissue it!1976 Hoodoo: Unreleased--find the master tapes and put it on the market please!1985 Centerfield: Five Stars1986 Eye Of The Zombie: Four Stars (yes, four stars, it's a solid album)1997 Blue Moon Swamp: Three Stars2004 Deja Vu All Over Again: Three and a Half Stars2007 Revival: Three and a Half Stars2009 The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again: Three and a Half Stars\n", "val": 0.011312458664178848}
{"text": "CCR has been my all-time favorite rock n' roll band for most of my 33 years, and in 2006 I was blown away by John Fogerty's excellent concert DVD \"The Long Road Home\" which found this great master of rock n' roll looking and sounding 20 years younger than his real age as he rocked his way through a great selection of his classic tunes with a top-notch backing band. The concert contained in that DVD offered stunning evidence that a 60 year old Fogerty had lost nothing with age and can still rock better than most guys half his age.There has always been a southern/bayou flavor in much of Fogerty's music throughout the years. It's remarkable how a guy born and raised in California can pull off that country fried sound with more authenticity than any other rock artist of his era. I grew up with classic country music as much as CCR, but turned my back on country in the early 90's when Nashville executives and record labels decided that every great artist over the age of 40 would be kicked off the radio forever in favor of a new young breed of twangy George Strait clones who would appeal to younger audiences. Sadly, this trend continues in Nashville today as cookie-cutter barbie dolls and manufactured pretty boys dominate the airwaves with far less talent and originality than the country legends that paved the way for them.Here in the bleakest decade of mainstream American music, it takes a rock n' roll hall of famer to show the kids in Nashville what REAL DEAL country music is all about. The one and only John Cameron Fogerty has managed to record a traditional country album so pure and down home it would make Merle Haggard and George Jones proud while blowing modern country puppets like Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, and Taylor Swift out of the water!Some reviewers have given this CD a poor rating, but the fact is that John Fogerty at his worst is still better than any modern rock star topping the charts in 2009. This album could have been a crossover smash on the country charts 20 years ago when quality music was still allowed on country radio. Fogerty offers vibrant new versions of classic tunes by Buck Owens, Ray Price, John Denver, and others with so much conviction that it's almost hard to believe this is the same guy that gave the world powerhouse rocking tunes like \"Fortunate Son\", \"Traveling Band\", \"Born on the Bayou\", and \"It came out of the sky\". This CD is a testament to John's versatility as a musician and his undeniable skill as a pure country performer. The arrangements of every song are pure country all the way with fiddles and steel guitars. John captures the original feel of Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party\" and John Denver's \"Back Home Again\" with so much ease it almost seems like these songs were written just for him. Only one Fogerty original is included in the entire album.Arranged and produced by the master himself, this CD might disappoint Fogerty fans hoping for the driving rock n' roll sound of John's classic work, but it's a blessing for any country music fan that has been deprived of the real thing for the last 15 years. Whether you prefer country or rock n' roll, this is still a fine effort by John Fogerty and is highly recommended to anyone hungry for REAL music which is getting harder than ever to find in a mainstream music scene where manufactured \"American Idols\" seem to spread faster than swine flu!\n", "val": 0.0022909333929419518}
{"text": "As a lifelong Fogerty fan, I anxiously anticipate each new release.  Some have fared better than others, and the same can be said for the song selection on \"Rides Again.\"  Unfortunately for every \"wow\" moment, I found myself saying, \"Why the heck did he choose this song?\"  Best example is John Denver's \"Back Home Again.\"  You just don't mess with perfection, and this was an iconic song for an iconic artist.On first listen, I felt the same way about Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party,\" an immensely personal song for Rick.  But oddly enough, I like JF's version.  It's note-for-note faithful to the original, but the original is so good, that's probably good strategy.Other standouts include the Buck Owens song (I had never heard it, but like JF's version on first listen), Pat Boone's \"Moody River\" (a pleasant surprise) and \"I'll Be There.\"  Generally good performances, but JF's song selection sometimes leaves me bewildered.\n", "val": 0.009094064123928547}

This is one of those times when I popped in the CD and was immediately knocked off my feet and just kept getting more and more impressed through to the end when I just had to sit in silent awe for a long moment.  The guy knows what he's doing, he has incredible talent, and impeccable choices on this CD.  I think all his hardships in the recording industry not only make us respect and love him more but also have seasoned him in a way that makes him able to really put his soul into these songs.  I love the way many albums in the last few years have almost been like divine jam sessions.  Mixing up the best of the best talents of our time to sing and play on songs that are out of their normal styles just has a way of making the best even better.  This one is like that with the great and diverse talent he has brought in to record with him.

Duets with John and Henley or especially John and Springsteen could be awesome. But I feel the instrumentals didn't let the voices shine thru. I would like to hear more collaborations with these guys in the future.Also I think my disc is flawed as whenever the steel guitar is supposed to solo, you can just barely hear it, whereas the violin or electirc guitar are nice and loud.\n", "val": 7.11246975697577e-05}

{"text": "The first thing you notice on this CD is how happy John Fogerty sounds. Well, he should, these are all the songs he loves- he says if he had to get up and sing in a bar, these are the songs he would choose.  The history of the Blue Ridge Rangers has been told many times-when it was time to hang up the Cleerance Clearwater tunes, he took some time off, but then recorded again. Not knowing how to sing without a group he named his group the Blue Ridge Rangers. However, he made up all the members and played every instrument.  That was years ago, and when he resurrected the group, he got some real good time players. This CD is the best, you are so gonna like it!These tunes of Fogerty's are some of the ones I love. The biggest and best surprise to me is Ricky Nelson's old 'Garden Party'-I have loved that song forever and John F says he can relate to it- he and Ricky were very smart men. Fogerty chose Don Henley to help him with this one- play it over and over. 'Never Ending Song Of Love' an old timer incarnate! 'Back Home Again' didn't we all love John Denver at one time?  Ray Price, 'I'll Be There If Ever You Need Me'-ya gotta love it- what a tune.  'Change In The Weather' is an original of John Fogerty's. I know you're gonna be shocked by this one' Moody River' originally sung by Pat Boone- it is marvelous!!! 'Heaven's Just A Sin Away' by the Kendalls- whoopee! And, to top this marvelous CD off, Bruce Springsteen joins John Fogerty with the Everly Brothers 'When Will I Be Loved'- never, ever heard it any better, never eva!LA Times says \"By nearly any measure, Fogerty belongs on the A list of rock musicians who matter. As Credence's chief songwriter, lead singer and guitarist, he created a remarkably deep body of work in an astonishingly short period from the 1968 release of the band's debut album through the group's 1972 swan song.\" Couldn't have said it any better myself!This is a mix of country, folk, rock n'roll and one of the best CDs I have heard in a long time.

{"text": "This is by far John Fogerty's worst album ever. And that includes the likes of \"Mardi Gras\" and \"Eye Of The Zombie\". This CD is a half-hearted, lazy and uninspired effort. Consisting of country song covers, only the most cousin-marrying, thigh-slapping, Deliverance banjo playing, moonshine-swilling country bumpkin could derive any enjoyment from this mess.Sounding like it was recorded in one afternoon when Fogerty had nothing else better to do, the arrangements are lackluster and his trademark strong vocals pedestrian. The collaborations with Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmidt and Bruce Springsteen sound literally phoned in.This pains me to write this because I am a huge John Fogerty fan. I am old enough to have been around during his Creedence days, and I own recordings dating back to his time with the Golliwogs. I truly believe he is the best American songwriter of the 20th Century. But a CD like this needs to be called out for what it is, a cheesy effort to bilk fans for a quick buck.I understand that many of his prior songs have county influences in them. And his first Blue Ridge Rangers album was primarily a county cover album. But that album also had energy and a definitive Fogerty spin to it. This one merely goes through the motions and is poor even by country music standards.Don't believe the hype of the critics and fanboys. Stay away from this one. This is a prime example of why people illegally download music. I purchased this through Amazon expecting a certain level of quality from this artist and I feel cheated.\n", "val": 2.3693708499195054e-05}
{"text": "The first thing that comes to mind on this CD is \"pure class\".Fogerty, one of the U.S.'s under-appreciated artists, is a man in his 60s, who somehow, has a remarkable voice that keeps improving.The professionalism of the band and Fogerty's painstaking arrangements and album production, makes it a joy to listen to.Fogerty's choice of country/rock/folksy songs are impeccable.That band is sensational. The pedal steel guitar, goes right through my heard. the country fiddler is perfect. Fogerty's acoustic guitar playing is fantastic, as the album is obviously a labor of love for John.The harmonies with Eagles Henly and Schmidt sound GREAT on Garden Party!! What great lyrics the late Rick Nelson wrote in that classic.The album is all about the music, not ego and it is a joy to hear a pro's pro doing it right. Fogerty's singing, arrangements and production really allows the listener to hear and feel the lyrics as almost all of the songs are covers of classics.If I were to compare the sound to anything, I would compare it to the early Poco albums, which was a combination of musicians, some of who stayed with Poco, some went to form The Eagles and then there was Loggins and Messina, for where Jim Messina went.Relax, kick back, and listen on a really good audio system. Please, not on a crappy Ipod, making these classic's MP3's.If portable, PLEASE getg a Cowon, which makes the Ipod sound like a tinny toy. The Cowon's have FLAC(losless) and OGG (the best lossy format available), native to them.Keep it going John.\n", "val": 0.02935747615993023}
{"text": "I particularly like this CD because Fogerty's voice sounds great and he sings with a sweet effortless voice. As the review in Rolling Stone notes, his voice and free spirit seem to fit well with country and he does sound at home and confident. His selection of songs has an interesting range from John Denver to Rick Nelson but these all seem to be songs that he appears to have personally selected. I have several of his more recent post Credence CDs and I find this one of his better releases. It may seem low key for die hard fans but it is  a record that Fogerty certainly wanted to do and the quality in his perfrmance won't displrease. Although country with a touch of  rock sound it does take me back Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in their early prime when they song some old tunes like \"When Will the Circle Be Unbroken\" . I particularly liked Pradise, Never Ending Song of Love, Garden Party (w/ Henley & Scmidt), Heaven is just a sin away and Fallin, Fallin, Fallin. I heard him two years ago in VA. Beach at the \"Two John's Concert\" (Fogerty/Mellencamp) and I think his voices here sounds even better.

This is not a ranting FanBoy review but rather coming from a first-gen, \"old\" hippie-I-was-there-when-Creedence-was-king... Seriousy, this is a beautiful... no... gorgeous collection of songs.For each song Fogerty sets his canvas on the musical easel and paints a sometimes simple, sometimes homespun, sometimes big-sounding collection of country flavored tunes as only he could do.  I'm going to keep this review simple; If you are a fan of CCR and Fogerty's solo work (especially his 1st Blue Ridge release) then this CD is a must... The highlight of this collection is \"Haunted House\" where I wish that, during the jam, the band would have kept the fire burning for another 10 minutes or so.  That's how good that cut is.

So how does it fair to Revival, pretty well.  Make no mistake, this is not Revival.  Revival was very much a rock album, and a bit of the old CCR style.  However, This new album is far more slow and laid back.  The kind of album I'd listen to on the porch, while drinking lemonade, if I had a porch or lemonade.  Though they are different in style, they are none the less great.  I know this album won't instantly appeal to people for looking for another Revival or CCR, but those looking for some great old school music will be pleasantly surprised.

{"text": "This album is the next generation piece to the original 1973 release. More people, a less-minimalist sound, later vintage material. That earlier release was the first John Fogerty solo album for followers of Creedence, and it came at a time when country was identified with the generation that said that you grow up, you go into the Army and get your butt shot at, because if you dodge the draft and go to college, attending classes taught by commie profs, you become a commie too. At the same time, prominent preachers said that rock was the \"devil's heartbeat\". So country became synonymous with uncool and you mocked it by howling like a hound dog. Fogerty took country, added blues the same way the 'Fifties rockabillies had done years before, and called it \"Creedence\". This album is the second disc of what might have been a double album that was finished 36 years later. Fogerty, being the mature artist he is, avoids coming up with totally new versions of the covers that are here, avoids the ego trip of \"making the songs his own\". Look, the man is around 60, so he's going to think like a grown-up. Even down to giving lead phrases in some songs to guest vocalists. He plays Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party\" straight ahead (matching the backup vocals and lead guitar hooks from the original), same as with John Denver's \"Back Home Again\". His own 1986 song \"Change In the Weather\" gets a countryish remake here. And remember the line in the Creedence classic \"Lookin' Out My Back Door\" that goes \"...listenin' to Buck Owens...\"? Fogerty gives tribute to the memory of his fellow Californian by including \"I Don't Care (Just As Long As You Love Me)\" here. Anybody who thinks solo Fogerty begins and ends with \"Centerfield\" (as well as thinking modern country began with Randy Travis and Garth Brooks) should grab this one, along with the 1973 Rangers release as a prologue.\n", "val": 0.00019239542598370463}

A year from the band's breakup, Fogerty immersed himself in musical roots with an album of covers, mostly country and gospel, played and sung entirely on his own. Even the album's cover echoed the solo theme, with Fogerty silhouetted as each of the fictional group's five members. Try as he might to distance himself from Creedence, however, his unmistakable voice and a track list of country songs upon which many of his own songs were built, couldn't help but point to his previous work.Thirty-six years later Fogerty has brought elements of the Blue Ridge Rangers' ethos back to the studio. Unlike the Rangers' first effort, this is more capstone and reminiscence than a place to gather oneself between career phases. More importantly, rather than layering his own instrumental and vocal performances in the studio, Fogerty's put together an actual Blue Ridge Rangers with the talents of guitarist Buddy Miller, steel/mandolin/dobro player Greg Leisz, drummer Kenny Aranoff and many others. He's also chosen to share the microphone with Eagles Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit on Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party,\" and Bruce Springsteen on the Everly Brothers' \"When Will I Be Loved.\"The song list remains an all-covers affair, including an earthy take of Fogerty's own \"Change in the Weather\" that drops the unfortunate mid-80s production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Eye-of-the-Zombie/dp/B00005B7FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eye of the Zombie</a>'s original. There are classic country tunes from Ray Price, Buck Owens and the Kendalls, but Fogerty also reaches to fellow singer-songwriters John Prine, Rick Nelson and John Denver, and favorites from Delaney & Bonnie, Pat Boone and the 1964 Jumpin' Gene Simmons R&B novelty, \"Haunted House.\" Highlights include Prine's environmentalist lyric of a bucolic childhood literally trucked away by a coal company and a take of Denver's \"Back Home Again\" that's adds a bit of Neil Young-like reediness to the original.Fogerty sounds relaxed and at home surrounded by fiddle and steel and riding a Ray Price shuffle beat, and the husk of his voice adds an element of solemn pain and earthen soul to Pat Boone's melodramatic death ballad, \"Moody River.\" The album closes with an overcooked Cajun-rock arrangement of \"When Will I Be Loved\" that has Fogerty and Springsteen reprising Phil and Don Everly. Though it's more of a lark than an artistic summit, it's great to hear two modern icons wailing away at their shared roots. That really sums up Fogerty's decision to bring the Blue Ridge Rangers back to life, as it's an opportunity for a great artist to revel in his equally great influences.

{"text": "\"Rides Again\" is a pretty and respectful take on a wonderful batch of songs, that's the long and short of it.  Often the original versions are actually better than these interpretations, but that doesn't stop this from being a pleasant listen.  Rick Nelson's Garden Party - era recordings are a good comparison...Fogerty has a little bit the same respectful distance from the listener, on this recording, wishing to please the listener more on the level of the beauty of the music than throwing his heart into it.  The first Blue Ridge album was actually a little looser, this one a little prettier.  The first album also featured more rockers, this one more ballads.  Fogerty's lone original is a highlight of this collection, in my opinion.\n", "val": 0.016827857121825218}

Anyone who owns more than a handful of records could tell that this project was done on a limited time and financial budget. It will sell but it will not endure the way the original Rangers album did.Fogerty's vocals lack any passion or commitment. The music is also less than inspired as is most evident on the flat-out duplication of Rick Nelson's Garden Party. The only musical high spot is some tasteful pedal steel work on a number of different tracks. At times it almost sounds as though Red Rhodes had come back to life. Still, I imagine that he and Papa Nez could have come out with a much improved final product with far less outside helpAll in all, a nice middle of the road listen, but like Chinese food, you'll be hungry again in 2 hours.\n", "val": 7.770327647449449e-05}

{"text": "Like many Fogerty fans, I was thrilled to see that John was again digging into his roots and influences to produce an album as his alter ego, the Blue Ridge Rangers. That original album holds a special place for me, as it was a window into the very foundation of Creedence Clearwater Revival, one of the greatest American rock bands of any era.Many folks forget that when the original album was released in 1973, it was not a John Fogerty album. The band was \"The Blue Ridge Rangers\"(no reference to Fogerty at all), the songs were all covers, and CCR was nowhere to be found. It was not promoted as a Fogerty project. I won't go into the well-known contract hassles and history of Fogerty, Fantasy and CCR, or why this was so. It really doesn't matter here. What does matter is that the original album was a brilliant effort entirely crafted by John Fogerty and it was clearly a love letter to the music that inspired him. Yet, when it was released, he was completely absent despite the fact that the record yielded two hit singles. No glory, no spotlight, nothing. The cover showed the band in silhouette standing on a ridge with the sun setting behind them. To make such an obviously personal record, a record that required an extraordinary effort in engineering and recording talent and technique, and then release it under the name of a fictitious band is hard to imagine even today.What a record that first Blue Ridge Rangers album was. When I hear the loose gospel harmonies, accompanied by a tentatively rattling tamborine, at the beginning of \"Workin' On A Building\" I get goosebumps. This was not the era of ProTools and digital recording. This was John Fogerty going into the studio with tape and reel and creating an aural movie. All by himself he became a gospel choir, riffing and rolling, clapping and stomping. You close your eyes and you are in the dream. There is John, sweat and passion, harmonizing and jamming with himself on the resonator slide. It is an absolute masterpiece. Listen to John drag the beat in \"Blue Yodel #4,\" listen to the Dixieland breakdown in the solo. Listen to the pedal steel and piano intro to \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\" and you are belly-up-to-the bar in a dusty roadhouse calling for a cold beer and a shot. The original album is literally a one-man history lesson in American roots music, from string band, to gospel, to blues, to country.The new album, on the other hand, seems more like Fogerty has gone into a studio with other musicians that he respects and said, \"I really enjoy these songs and think I can add something to them.\" You hear the band go to work, and good work it is. However, it is a very different effort than the original Blue Ridge Rangers recording. It is a pleasure to listen to, and it is clear that Fogerty has a fondness for the music and the original artists he covers here. What is missing is the passionate genius of the original. Frankly, that would have been too much to ask. It is unfair to expect \"Rides Again\" to take us back to 1973. Fogerty has changed and so have we as an audience. The window that he opened for his fans on the musical influnces that infused CCR created a wonder in the early 1970's that we cannot expect today. Today, roots albums have been done, and done again. To some extent, we have become jaded. We expect too muchTaken for what it is, \"Rides Again\" is an excellent album of great songs performed by one of American music's true genius synthesists. Let's enjoy it for what it is, not what it cannot be.\n", "val": 0.0005136529798619449}
{"text": "Many highlights on this record, the best is a sublime cover of Rick Nelson's \"Garden Party,\" this version featuring Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmidt of the Eagles. The background harmonies are perfect, the steel guitar breaks are spot on, and Kenny Aronoff's drumming is second to none. Also, a rocking cover of Buck Owens' \"I Don't Care,\" almost cuts the original. The Everly's \"When Will I Be Loved\" (a duet with Springsteen) is great. The best song is \"Change In The Weather.\" He gets right back into rocking swamp mode, and fires on all cylinders--hinting has voice may be best suited for his own brand of self-penned country/rock.

Yes, Fogerty is much more subdued singing wise then many fans may be used to, but that's the charm of Fogerty's musical magic.  Even with CCR he sang some great country-tinged tunes like \"Lodi\", \"Lookin' Out My Backdoor\" and \"Crosstie Walker\".

{"text": "In the same year that Grunge was well and truly selling billions of CDs worldwide, US Heavy Metal legends Manowar released their seventh full-length studio album  1992s The Triumph Of Steel.It must have been no easy task following up their immensely popular and loyally beloved 1988 release Kings Of Metal, nor must it have been easy having to train up a new drummer and guitarist after losing Scott Columbus and Ross The Boss Friedman. In fact, nor can it have been fun trying to promote an album of blistering, powerful, OTT Heavy Metal after Man In The Box and Smells Like Teen Spirit changed what mustve felt like every journalist on earths priorities in the pre-internet culture of the day.Despite all that was going against them, Manowar released what must surely be one of their greatest ever albums (certainly its my personal favourite at any rate). Call it ambition, or call it arrogance, but the band even opened up the record with a twenty-minute long song. A song with a bass solo, a drum solo so indulgent that it has a separate solo for the cymbals and for the drums, two minutes of somber guitar violining all telling the story of Achillies and Hector from Greek Mythology. The world wanted Touch Me Im Sick Manowar gave em Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts.Despite how easy it is to skip a twenty-minute album opener with three solos in it, the song isn't poor. In fact, some sections of it are absolute genius, such as the furious Thrashy Death Hectors Reward part, which feels like the musical equivalent of being battered upside the head.After that, the first normal-length track comes in. Its my favourite track on the album, or by the band. Metal Warriors is the most perfectly-pitched, sing-along tribute to Heavy Metal thats ever been written. Ludicrous to the point of featuring the lyric If you're not into Metal you are not my friend and yet musically out of this world. Its some kind of supercharged version of Kiss I Love It Loud filled with Painkiller screams, mountain-top chants and the screech of guitars that feel only-barely in control.Theres more blistering speed, in the sword-and-scorcery realm of Ride The Dragon with its constant double-kicks and incredibly catchy chorus.The band then take a different tack, choosing to sing about Native Americans in a surprisingly tasteful way, in an interesting mid-paced affair that sonically evokes cowboy movies subtly, but doesnt loose that Manowar sound. Maybe they were jealous of Anthrax? Who cares why they did it, but it works, really well!Then they follow it up with another mid-paced track called Burning which youd imagine might be a momentum killer, but is actually one of the more interesting compositions in the bands catalogue. Its a bit different than their usual any of their usual directions epics, ballads, rousing anthems or blistering speed. Its a nice change of pace. Sort of experimental, with a lot of emphasis on dynamics and Eric Adams trying out as many vocal techniques as he can imagine.Power Of Thy Sword comes next, and its what I would consider the quintessential Manowar song. If you wonder if the band are for you, this is one of the tracks you should use to decide. Its got everything thats great about the band in spades. Its so powerful, OTT and fun. Its beyond catchy, the solo is awesome, theres slow bits, fast bits and theres a touch of the orchestral epic-ness that the band aspire to. With this one song, you get a good musical, technical and lyrical picture of Manowar oh, and by the way its a great song too!Even if the last one felt good enough to be an album closer, it doesnt stop there. Theres more Metal in the form of The Demons Whip. A robust, interesting track which is half crushing Sabbath-inspired Doom and half double-kick Thrash attack, almost-ending the album with a jarring reverse-whiplash effect as the too-slow doom accelerates out of control to the tune off way-too-loud whip samples.It all closes with the grand, cinematic, vocally-impressive Master Of The Wind which kind of evokes Greg Lake-era King Crimson with its chiming bells, big reverb, dynamic production and haunting singing. Its probably the best ballad/orchestral-track that Manowar ever did. Not something to be skipped, but a genuine album highlight in itself.Overall; Triumph Of Steel is a really diverse and almost strange album. Despite its seeming lack of focus, it really feels like Manowar just doing everything they could think of to absolute perfection. Anthem  nailed. Ballad  absolutely nailed. Fast bits  nailed. Slow bits  nailed. Exploring new ideas  nailed. Keeping true to what makes Manowar, Manowar  nailed. It might not have gotten the attention it deserved at the time, but for my money this album is a straight up-and-down masterpiece that shows what superb musicians, performers and songwriters Manowar are from every possible angle. Highly Recommended!\n", "val": 0.00672871945425868}

There's Magic in The Metal, there's Magic in us all!\"Referring to the audience, this is a rallying cry to the 'Metal Warriors' to remain pure in true Metal.3. Ride The DragonOne can literally hear the sounds of mighty dragons arising from the stigeon depths to soar across the skies, blackening the land, ruling the heavens with their fearsome symmetry. Yet there would invariably be those who resonate with this form, seeking to cooperate with their existence, thus using them for their steeds.

Features Eric Adams translating a chanting medicine man recounting the events of the pale-face occupation, immediately proceeding into war drums... the war dance and paint, the drums, and earth-quaking hooves of steeds, arrows, tomahawks, blades, and spears at the ready, to confront the strangers from abroad, who themselves consider these natives devils, and vice-versa. Scalping time! 5. BurningAsserts The Darwinian Survival of The Fittest, while watching antagonists perish. Alternations between whispered lyrics in quiet instrumental undulation, and power-driving drums and guitars, combined with Adams' remarkably varied, soaring and sustaining vocals.6. The Power Of Thy Sword \"They will know The Power of My sword!\"Another inspiring hymn providing motivation to maintain strength and perspective. Almost literally, as those deserving figuratively find themselves at the point of the ritual Sword.7. The Demon's WhipBeginning with the sounds of a match-strike igniting a candle, followed by an incantation, the demon is summoned from Hades with bestial malevolence. This song features aggressively-driving guitars, with the sounds of the stinging whip and the explosive strike. Feel The Demon's Whip!8. Master Of The WindA beautifully-inspiring ballad observing the passage of warriors into that rainbow in the sky, where eagles fly, as well as the survivors of battle._________Besides the Victorious Music, Triumph Of Steel features a mini-poster insert {with lyrics on the other side} actually suitable for framing, featuring The Shadow Warrior emerging triumphant with sword and hammer in hand, accepting empowerment in the form of lightning from the sky, while being surrounded by beautifully demonic, and lustful women. Beneath him, a demon cracks the whip in the caverns of Hades. Powerful imagery to match the potent anthems herein.\n", "val": 0.021354852244257927}

PS for those fools who like to bash amazon reviewers for their grammar and spelling, i realize my grammar sucks and i have enough of a life, as to not be caught up with the perfectness of my amazon reviews.)HIGHLY RECOMENDED.\n", "val": 0.012705930508673191}
{"text": "Any band, especially metal that can lay down and record a twenty-eight minute epic that is based on the tale of Homer's 'Iliad', the disc's opener, \"Achilles, Agony & Ecstasy In Eight Parts\" must be given credit where credit is due. What a concept album. On the track \"Death Of Patroclus\", vocalist Eric Adams puts some emotion about the pain in which Achilles endures when his best friend gets slain by the evil Hector. A couple of the CD's rockers I also liked were \"Ride The Dragon\" and \"Power Of The Sword\". This was the band's seventh lp. Might be their best work since 1984's 'Hail To England'. If you are looking for some fine earth-shattering heavy metal, look no further.\n", "val": 0.03312581777572632}
{"text": "Manowar is one of those bands that has a lot of songwriting talent but are often dismissed from their inability to graduate from the \"all hail us\" kind of mentality that characterizes their lyrics.  This album marks somewhat of a departure from that songwriting mentality; I say somewhat because it is still present on a few songs.  However, overlooking that aspect, most of the material showcases some real lyrical talent, not to mention the amazing instrumental feats. This is not an album for those with short attention spans.  This is not to be listened to piecemeal, or a little here and there.  Lock the door, disconnect the phone, and put this on as loud as your neighbors will tolerate.  It will blow you away.  The first song, over 28 minutes in eight separate movements, is a masterful discourse of the story of ancient Troy in Greek myhology.  Follow the leaflet so you understand the separate movements and what they represent, and you will be hard pressed to find anything similar in modern music that can reach this plateau.  This is the kind of songwriting skill that the classical music masters put into their work, and it takes on a similar style and grandeur.  The subsequent tracks all showcase similar effort, although the theme varies.  The final track, Master of the Wind, is a soaring spiritual journey into the eternal strength of the human character that packs a more powerful punch than any of their earlier \"we rule\" mentality songs ever could.  This album is an oddity for Manowar in their career, always advertising on the record sleeve \"no synths, no pedals, no wimps: just power, metal, and might\" they make extensive use of them in this album, and somehow stand more powerful and mighty through their intelligent use of such devices to bring their music to another level.  Incidentally, the drummer for this album, listed only as \"Rhino\", is the most talented drummer I have ever heard, making Lars Ulrich and Tommy Lee look like kids banging on upturned kitchen pots in comparison.  Too bad he isn't on any of their other albums.  But then, none of their other albums even compare to this one.\n", "val": 0.01118418388068676}
{"text": "I've only heard every album preceding this so far (except Sign of the Hammer).  But unless Warriors of the World is the most kick-ass Manowar album I'll ever hear this is by far their best.  The production is bigger than the early-eighties albums.  But the mtv-leanings that the last two albums had with songs like \"Blow your Speakers\" and \"Kings of Metal\" are gone.  Instead the best elements of both those times, the purely medieval focus of Hail to England and the cleaner production of Fighting the World are combined in Triumph of Steel for the best Manowar album I've heard.  All the songs are great but the best is Spirit Horse of the Cherokee (even though it is a pretty stereotypical view of Native Americans).

{"text": "this is what that particular manowar album does to you; at the 0:59 seconds mark, the \"intro\" ends with the distortion still lingering and you're wiped off the ground with one of the most awesome battery sounds you'll ever hear! accompanied razor sharp riffing, this is an audial moment that you'll permanently remember. Eric adam's voice slices through the instruments loud, clear and demonically furious! i think his performance on \"triumph...\" is his best (studio) vocal performance with manowar. back to the music: the magnificently chilling keyboard laden interlude ends and Achilles vows to avenge his comrade's death (the bells' sound along with the keyboards' makes the passage perfect for an epic soundtrack). the scenery evoked by the music in here is so vivid! i always look out for music that actually makes one SEE as well as hear, which is strongly the case in here. now some people might not like the lengthy drum solo coming by now. i personally skip through it. it's just here to reinforce the concept of the gods forging Achilles' armor. As the solo abruptly ends, all hell breaks loose again with torrential double bass drumming, bass, guitars and mr adams' incredibly versatile vocals, going in a second from low growling bass to formidable high pitched screams.now \"every one of us has heard the call!!!\" and one of the best manowar songs ( metal warriors) kicks in with its sublime rythms. a true, timeless heavy metal hymn. and please don't start arguing that their lyrics are 'cheesy' and their attitude 'sucks' etcetc....if you want pensive music you're at the wrong window, PAL.\"Ride the dragon\" has its awesome intro where the guitars faithfully imitate a dragon's voice (sometimes, i admit i DO take manowar seriously!): this track screams \"FAST\" all the way; blistering drumming, whiplashing guitars and a fast talking vocalist. i'm smiling again....oh my god...\"Spirit horse...\" is a song about the Cherokee indian tribe. it has my personally favorite manowar chorus and the slow double bass drumming reinforces the song's monumental atmosphere.\"Burning\" is my absolute top song by Manowar. it's opening, delayed riff has \"METAL\" written all over it. this and Adams' whispered lyrics and brutally ascending and menacing tone make this song drip with evil and consumes you within its foggy, malevolent atmospheres.\"power of thy sword\" is a classic manowar epic with swords slashing, winds blowing and grand choruses. very very good.\"The demon's whip\" is maybe one and a half minute too long and i end up loving it at its very end, when you think the song ended but it blasts in back with unimaginable  thrashing fury and E. Adams almost barking the lyrics!\"Master of the wind\" is the perfect, zippo-friendly closer; beautiful lyrics, grandiose keyboarding and passionate vocals from this incredible frontman.this album is metal. great music, great artwork, great band. if you're a metal fan and don't have this, then something's wrong with you.\n", "val": 0.03201183304190636}

That means nothing to me since I enjoy listening to Metal, but what what about those who don't? Are these guys saying that they have a burning hatred and intolerance for those who don't listen to Metal? That's not what Metal is supposed to be about.

{"text": "Manowar is looked upon as godly(the fans are hardcore, more than just about any group you can think of)or thought of as heavy metal's biggest joke.  This was my first taste of Manowar back in the day, and I was a little confused about it at first.  I wasn't sure if they were trying to be funny or not.  Well, since I got more into them over the years I know that these guys are dead serious about what they're doing.  They're music and image is extremely cornball, I would hope even the most hardcore fan could admit to seeing a bit of humor in it all.  But to me, that's all a part of what makes Manowar Manowar.  These guys are the epitome of male ma-cheese-mo;  I mean, they're the total embodiment of tough guy-Conan-badass-motorcycle riding-sexist-violent maleness taken to it's most extreme.  It makes you want to strip down to your undies and run about the house wielding an invisible sword while munching on a giant turkey leg.  And that's just the way they portray themselves.  But, for all of this braggadocio these guys really do know how to play, they're not all about image.  Eric Adams has one helluva voice though it sounds like he's straining too hard on the high notes.  When you listen to his raspy high pitched scream, you can just envision him with a blue face, veins bulging, on the verge of his head exploding.  That's a singer.  So, say what you want about them, but there's only one Manowar.  If you're curious, it wouldn't hurt to give this album a spin.  I would think most heavy metal fans will get something out of Manowar, even if it is only a good laugh.  I think you'd have to be a real stiff to wholeheartedly say that you \"hate\" them, but there are certainly many out there who do.  However, there isn't one group in existence that isn't hated by someone somewhere.  So, give these guys a shot;  For better or worse, you'll always remember them.\n", "val": 0.00023827754193916917}
{"text": "I have to admit that the thing that got me interested in Manowar was the unique look of their logo, since besides music, my first love has always been multimedia and design. The logo looked so cool that I thought I'd do a little research into the music itself. Being a child of the '80s, I have a sort of \"G.I. Joe/Rambo\" macho thing going, always have. I heard clips of \"Metal Warriors\" and \"Ride The Dragon,\" my first tastes of Manowar, and I was instantly hooked! Needless to say, I ended up buying the CD. This is true, POWERFUL metal, nothing more, nothing less. From the opening, almost operatic chords of \"Achilles: Agony and Ectasy in 8 Parts\" to the slow, emotional ballad that is \"Master of the Wind,\" there is hardly ever a place where this CD lets you down. I have to say that the night after the events of 9/11/01, I cranked up the speakers in my car to \"Burning,\" and I felt like everything was going to be all right, \"THE STRONG WILL SURVIVE!\" VERY good CD; it has made me a lifelong fan of the Kings of Metal!\n", "val": 0.04599228873848915}
{"text": "As they themselves stated in \"Metal Daze\" so many years ago, Manowar is a social wedge.  Not that many people are on the fence about this band.  Love them for all their hairy chested, macho power, or hate them as cheesy wackos who belive their own hype.  If you love Conan the Barbarian or 13th Warrior, if you've read Beowulf more than twice, you'll probably love this band.  If you're tired of the endless, undifferentiated, overprocessed metal that is rampant today, but have fond memories of groups like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, this might just be the thing.  Yes, Manowar has its moments of overblown bombast and sometimes verges on the absurd, but the quality of the musicianship is hard to deny.  On this record, as well as all their other releases, they show you unvarnished emotion and dedication to a vision.  It's always easy to pick on a true believer.  Give \"Triumph of Steel\" a chance, though, and you might find yourself \"melted down and reforged in the fires of true heavy metal\".  Could be fun.\n", "val": 0.014407251961529255}

I GAVE THIS CD TO A FRIEND AND HE TOO AGREES IT IS TERRIBLE. I HAVE NOT YET FOUND 1 PERSON WHO CAN LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM.Reasons why it <is sooo bad>:1)atrocious music: it seems that manowar don't know what exactyl music is, they haven't yet found out how to make anything that sounds remotely interesting.its the same boring power chord riffs over and over with some of the worst rythm i have ever heard.and the composition skills of manowar are just pathetic2)the vocalist:yes the worst part of the band if the music is bad he is frightfully terribly bad. he doesnt even sing he just chants out the idiotic lyrics like an actor who is reciting shakespeare3)the lyrics: this band obviously thinks that they are evil warriors or something. its really pathetic that they haevnt grown up yet. the best lyric is without doubt: 2,4,6,8 your soul i will desecrate....

Starting out with the Wagnerish, Achilles Agony and Ecstasy in 8 Parts, which is basicaly an opera, with everything that belongs in one. It is grand. It is loud, it is Manowar.The album is basicaly a lineup of great songs, it could have been a best of album, for all I know. Spirit Horse of the Cherokee, a hymn to the native american braves, a very catchy tune, that gets the blood pumping. Among other favourites are, The Power of Thy Sword, a traditional Manowar battle hymn, but so well done that it ranks among their best ever. The Demons Whip, a song that starts out slow, but picks up untill it reaches an insane pace. The last track Master of the Wind is propably Manowars ultimate power-balad, powerful, emotional, grand.The album is one long line of pearls, all you have to do is choose the one you prefer, because there are no flawed ones.

This album was the one most recommended to me, and although some of the songs are utterly boding and uninspiring, others show why this band has the reputation it does.  The opening song, the 28-minute masterpiece, is not quite on par with songs like Symphony X's \"Divine Wings Of Tragedy\", but it's sure up there.  With some very awesome instrumentation, it makes that half hour go away like its not even there.  The rest of the songs range from great to cr@p, with the better ones being \"Spirit Horse of the Cherokee\", and \"Master of the Wind, both of which are super.  \"The Demon's Whip\" and \"Power of Thy Sword\" are pretty good, but the rest sound like fillers to me, and don't do much of anything special.

{"text": "Manowar is one of those bands that has no clue, but they put it well, \"Wimps and Posers, leave the hall...\". While I think that half of their intensely loyal fandom comes from the way they hype themselves up in their music, I have to admit they are some very talented individuals. Joey DiMaio is one of the best bass players out there on pure technical skill, though his artistry doesn't quite compare to Geddy Lee or Les Claypool, and Eric Adams has got an unbelievable set of pipes, even if he doesn't quite use them with the skill of a Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate. The songs on this album are fast and hard, though I wouldn't particularly call them \"heavy\" in the classic sense. They may have a Guiness record for loudest band ever, but their music won't really melt your face like Slayer, Pantera, Fear Factory, etc. That is, of course, unless you're playing them through a 40 ft. Marshall stack, but who really does that anyway except the band themselves? \"Achilles\" is a long song and it has some great parts but tends to be stale in others. However, I have to say that I really like the rest of the album in a homey sort of way. This music just has a quality to it that makes you feel good, believe it or not. You listen and you think of the days back in high school sitting in a buddy's room listening to albums, or watching Headbanger's Ball on MTV. The band has talent, but not perfect talent. They have attitude, but it's not attitude that makes you think of them as superstars. They are accessible and human, and that definitely comes through in their music, which is probably its most appealing quality. \"The Demon's Whip\" and \"The Power of Thy Sword\" are probably my favorites. Overall this is a good album, but despite it's definite appeal it never quite reached in and tugged the heart strings or got me amped like Kings of Metal did. Go buy it, and you'll probably love it or possibly be underwhelmed by it, but either way you shouldn't be disappointed. If you are a fan of Manowar none of this matters. You'll love it regardless because it has that ineffable Manowar spirit that only true fans of the band can understand.\n", "val": 0.007991756312549114}

{"text": "This could quite possibly be one of the best tribute projects to come out in quite sometime. {certainly one of the best birthday presents!} It is also an amazing reminder of the body of work that was Maze Featuring the oh so wonderful Frankie Beverly.  The Maze imprint is definitely here with an excellent representation of the band's work featuring a stellar array of R&B performances.Maze/Frankie Beverly in the 70/80s was known far and wide for smooth silky vocals and sensuous yet spiritually exciting grooves that worked well on the dance floor, in your bedroom, and most assuredly while worshiping:0)  It is only fitting that the contributing artists step up and represent.And indeed they do....highlights include Mint Condition's \"Back in Stride\", Mary J! Nary J! Nary J! with an exquisite reading of \"Before I Let Go\", Ledisi blisters \"Happy Feeling\", Musiq Soulchild with a deliciously wicked \"Silky Soul Singer,\" Joe, in fine, fine form on \"Can't Get Over You.\" and a woooooooooooonderful surprise from Raheem Devaughn who WORKS \"We Are One.\"Of course there are a few ho-hums: Avant's rendition of 'Joy & Pain\" is somewhat lackluster, Kevin Edmonds' \"Never Let You Go\" is so-so and one wonders if the choice of Kem for \"Golden Time of Day\" was the best choice, given more powerful male vocalists still around like say, Charlie Wilson, Peabo, Jeffrey Osborne, Calvin Richardson or even Anthony Hamilton.Notwithstanding, if you are indeed into R&B for grown folks, with just the right contemporary flavor, it is indeed a head-swayin, toe-tappin', hip-swayin', mood-groovin', thoroughly fitting tribute to one of R&B's premiere acts who deserve it and who can be most proud of the finished product.My biggest complaint to be sure would probably be the glaring absence of the group's first big hit \"When I'm Alone\" which pretty much cemented their brand.  When I think of what Ledisi, or Joe, or Mary J or The Clark Sisters, or, hey, even all of these guys together could do with THAT song, ahhhhh, I shiver at the possibilities....:0)Excellent production, top-notch performances, to real soul aficionados, I hiiiiiiiiiiiighly recommend!!!\n", "val": 0.014913588762283325}

I'm split 50/50 on this one, because I would rather listen to Maze featuring Frankie Beverly than this cd. It's just hard for me to listen to someone else singing Maze's music because Frankie Beverly's voice is so powerful and unique.It was a nice try and I'm sure the selected artist did their very best.

But I was very pleasantly surprised by this collection as each artist (all very skilled and true artists) made each track their own.  They made them new again.  The songs kept their original flavor, while bringing something new, whether it was singing in a different key, adding harmonies, adding riffs, or giving the song a new feel.  My favorite was Kevon Edmonds' rendition of \"Never Let You Down.\"  It was so good, I think that might have to be my wedding song someday!  Kem's rendering of \"Golden Time of Day\" sent chills down my spine.  I loved the new feel added to Musiq's \"Silky Soul\" and \"I Wanna Thank You\" with The Clark Sisters.  Raheem DeVaughn knocked me out with his vocals on \"We Are One,\" and Ledisi proved why she is a true artist and a powerful singer on \"Happy Feelins.\"  Mint Condition, the only band on the LP, turned in a solid performance that paid tribute to the old while making it new, while Joe and Avant were smooth on their tracks.  The only track I wasn't impressed with was Mary J. Blige's \"Before I Let Go.\"  That's a hard song to remake and have people accept, but Mary didn't even sound like she was trying.

I do have to say there were a couple I didn't care for which surprised me: Mary J Blige & Mint Condition. Never the less-the CD was still 5 stars!My favorites are:*Silky Soul*Golden Time of Day (KEM) - Where has he be been??? Time for KEM to come back!*We Are One- Raheem Davaughn (Simply Beautiful!)*Can't Get Over You- Joe (So nice and to listen to it twice)*Happy Feelin's- Ledisi (Girl! PUT HER FOOT IN IT)*Never Let You Down - Kavond Edmonds (Ahhh...refreshing)*Joy & Pain- Avant (I usually don't care for this artist, but here I liked him ALOT)\n", "val": 0.035091936588287354}

Raheem  DeVaugh  did a great job on\" We are One\"  sounds a lot a lot like the original but with a added bit of flavor. Kem \"Golden Time of Day\" is just awesome! \"Joy & Pain by Avant is great also.  The entire CD is off the hook!!!!\n", "val": 0.05588888004422188}
{"text": "This tribute CD is a cut above the many generic sounding tribute CDs out these days. The music and vocals are faithful to the REAL SILKY SOUL sound that Maze is known for. For me, the money track is by Ledisi. Her rendering of \"Happy Feelings\" is just not good but, damn good. Midway through the song, Ledisi sounds as if she's channeling Stephanie Mills' memorable style of vocal delivery.A prime assembly of talent was brought together for this project. Musiq Souchild, Mary J Blige, Avant, Kem and others really bring it! Frank Beverly's son produced what is a great soulful homage to his dad. The only thing better is the original songs as Frank & his posse recorded and continually perform live.\n", "val": 0.019137335941195488}

The whole CD is great minus 1. Mint Conditon song did not fit to me. It wasn't as smooth as the other tracks. I like the Mint, but they were not right for this CD, no disrespect to the Mint. Love the Soulchild steppers version of Silky Soul. Sounds like Soulchild is singing from the heart about Frankie as Frankie sang about Marvin. If you like Maze this CD is a keeper.

Having listened to \"9\" for the better part of a day now, over and over again, I can't wait to hear what she does next.Elfman's involvement is clear but minimal, drawing from his previous Terminator score for any kind of a theme on his part. The rest of the score is a moody, sweeping and rather tense collection of world-building and at times anonymous themes that highlight both the action sequences and the more emotional moments. High points from the score lie at the beginning and end, with \"The Seamstress\", \"The Purpose\" and \"Release\" rising one after the other into an epic finale.While it may not have the catchy (and almost annoyingly repetitive) themes a la \"Wanted\" and \"Hellboy II\", the soundscape Lurie paints perfectly describes the world and doesn't saturate it with an overwhelming theme. Sometimes the score doesn't have to \"be the most important part\", it simply needs to \"be\", and let the film play out, aided simply by a beautiful soundtrack that plays just as well off-screen as I imagine it does on.\n", "val": 0.008368670009076595}

{"text": "A post-apocalyptic animated adventure, 9 is the first feature length film from director Shane Acker, who received a Best Animated Short Film Oscar nomination in 2005 for the short film on which this movie is based. The film is set in a future time when humanity has been wiped out following a devastating war, and has been replaced by a new species: sentient rag-doll like creatures known as Stitchpunks. The Stitchpunks - who are all named for the numbers 1 to 9 - spend most of their time running from the massive roving animal-shaped robots hunting them, until the youngest Stitchpunk, the 9 of the title, encourages the others to fight back. The film has an impressive voice cast including Elijah Wood, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Martin Landau and John C. Reilly, is produced by Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, and has an original score by comparative newcomer Deborah Lurie.Lurie has been around the peripheries of the film music world for nearly a decade, orchestrating for John Ottman and Mark Snow, writing additional music on films such as Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, and several recent Danny Elfman scores, while providing original scores for Sleepover in 2004, An Unfinished Life in 2005, and Sydney White in 2007. 9 is by far her most high-profile assignment to date, and although her hiring to score this film might be seen as a little unusual, in fact she has a working history with several of the major parties, having written additional music for Bekmambetov on Wanted amongst others. It's always gratifying to see young composers hired to score major movies, and even more gratifying for a woman to score something other than a costume drama or a `sensitive' film. Debbie Wiseman, Jane Antonia Cornish and the late, great Shirley Walker have all shown that women can compose action-packed sci-fi music with the best of them - and now Lurie adds her name to that list.Lurie's score is big, loud and exciting, written for full orchestra, choir and electronics, but the one thing truly missing from the score is a theme - which is somewhat curious, as Danny Elfman has a prominent credit for writing \"themes\" on the score's CD cover. Elfman has, of course, written many excellent themes in his time, but 9 doesn't seem to contain one of them. Elfman's style is so unmistakable that you would think anything written by him would be immediately obvious, but this is not the case here. Even in the most blatantly thematic cue, \"The Seamstress\", the thematic part of music never progresses much beyond a simple ascending brass melody. There are a couple of moments of ooh-aah choral prettiness, in \"Sanctuary\" for example, which could be the work of Elfman, but overall the `themes' - if they exist - are so subtle that one has to wonder why Elfman was hired at all, as Lurie could surely have written something similar with ease. Maybe having his name on the CD cover is a marketing tool.What we have instead is an enjoyable, exciting action score which is curiously anonymous. There's nothing inherently wrong with the music at all: it creates a menacing atmosphere, contains several excellent action moments, and a couple of sequences of touching down time, notably \"Reunion\", which features a lovely section for guitar and flute, the lyrically playful \"Twins\", and the tragic-sounding \"Burial\". Lurie clearly knows her way around an orchestra, and more often than not uses live instruments to lead the way, only resorting to electronica to add to her sound palette when necessary. This element alone puts her ahead of many of her contemporaries.The only problem with the score is its lack of identity; there's nothing to separate 9 from the dozens of other sci-fi action scores written each year, no central musical element that identifies it as being this movie's score and nothing else. It's a shame, because Lurie clearly has the talent to create an impressive sound with her orchestra; if there had been some kind of melodic hook to go with it, it would have added volumes to the score.Having said that, the action music is very good indeed, with dominant thrusting rhythms, a forceful brass section, and some clever clanging percussive effects to represent the relentless metal beasts with which the Stitchpunks do battle. Cues such as \"Winged Beast\", \"The Machines\", \"Return of the Machines\", \"Reawakening\" are loud and powerful. When the chanting choir appears during \"Slaying the Beast\" and \"The Aftermath\" the sense heroism in the music increases dramatically, while the vivid synth effects and almost Goldenthal-esque brass writing in \"The Seamstress\" add a wonderful level of danger to the moment.The score's finale, consisting of \"The Purpose\" and \"Release\" contains some of the best action music on the album, very energetic and creative, with some especially dramatic and commanding brass writing, eventually building in emotional fashion to a soaring, hopeful, orchestra-and-choir climax that is quite beautiful. The album concludes with a very good prog-rock song, \"Welcome Home\" by Coheed and Cambria, taken from their 2005 album `Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness', and which featured prominently in the film's trailer.I'm a little torn in how to effectively summarize 9. On the one hand, I'm delighted that Deborah Lurie is scoring this film in the first place - it's another crack in film music's glass ceiling. The score contains a great deal of very good action music, and some lovely moments of choral beauty, which in itself makes the CD worth recommending. But, as I said, the only thing holding it back is its lack of a truly individual identity, and the seemingly minimal involvement of Danny Elfman's theme-writing prowess. Some may like it; some may consider it anonymous. I just hope it works as a stepping stone to allow Lurie's career to go on to bigger and better things.\n", "val": 0.027186958119273186}

{"text": "OB4CL2 is an excellent project! Listed as a sequel to its instant-classic predecessor, this latest installment continues where CL1 left off. Appropriately guest starring GFK (Ghost Face Killah), the energy and chemistry between the duo is undeniable. Raekwon smartly looked to credible hardcore rap producers to help bring to life the street energy that the Cuban Linx theme embodies. Notable producers such as RZA, Marley Marl, Pete Rock and J Dilla add necessary ingredients to the Cuban Linx recipe. The only people missing from this project are ODB and Nas. However, his lineup is not saturated with guest appearances. Instead, Raekwon successfully manages to hold his own for over half of the album. His equally imaginative music video to \"House of Flying Daggers\" is a wonderful complement to the song.Raekwon's sound takes listeners back to gritty Shaolin of the 1990s; however, the production does not sound like leftover beats from that era. Instead, it is a fresh, new take on NYC street life and drama. Raekwon tells terrific stories throughout, narrating a journey through New York's underbelly. There is no glitz and glamour here. This album features no hollywood name-dropping, european exotic car and exotic vacation destination references.Raekwon's focus is clear and it is all about a genuine agenda to keep Hip Hop culture fresh, consistent and authentic. OB4CL2 demonstrates the Wu are not only still relevant to Hip-Hop, but they are also still necessary for properly representing the culture. Throw your W's up! Salute to Raekwon and the Wu family for a successful release!\n", "val": 0.02876988984644413}

I can't lie and say its surpasses the first Cuban Linx, however it does come extremely close. I have to admit at first, I was not as drawn to the album as I thought I would be. Although, after having a second ot third listen, I have been hooked. It took some time for the album to grow on me. At first the production kind of put me off. Even though the music was nicely done, the only downside to it was I have heard them before, i.e. Pyrex Vision uses the same sample as O.C.'s Jewels, Canal Street has been used countless times, i.e. Fat Joe's Fight Club and AZ's Vendetta. After overlooking to these minor details, I still feel its a great album. The best in 2009, in my opinion. Highlights for me were, House of Flying Daggers, Cold Outside, Black Mozart, New Wu, Surgical Gloves, Ason Jones and Three Bricks. I have to admit, I wasn't soo impressed with Catalina and About Me, both produced by Dr. Dre and Mark Batson. But eventually they grew on me.Overall, the best album of 2009.

This album solidifies my reason for appreciating the Wu Tang movement more than I appreciate the works of B.I.G. and Pac (get mad if you want to).  I'm in my 20's, and IMO, the Wu Tang era was the best solitary thing to ever happen to hip-hop (how else could a member of the Wu release a sequel 15 years later and have it deemed nearly a classic?), even with my favorite rapper being Jay-Z.  I don't know how they do it, but each member of the Clan has had a hand in turning hip-hop into an actual art, where what matters isn't age, but the work that's created and the thinking behind it.  I admit, hip-hop has veered from it's artistic qualities since the 90's, but this album gives me hope that hip hop will one day be looked at like the works of revered visual artists, with viewers appreciating the time, effort and subject matter applied to it, not how kitschy the artist is.  4.5/5 (Probably soon to be a 5/5).\n", "val": 0.028752226382493973}

{"text": "In 1995, Raekwon released, what I feel is still the most popular Wu Tang solo CD today, the infamous \"purple tape\",&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Only-Built-4-Cuban-Linx/dp/B000002WU9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</a>.  The RZA was able to craft a classic with his production and Raekwon, Ghostface and the rest of The Wu Gambinos took care of the rest.  My favorite tracks included \"Guillotine (Swords)\" w/Raekwon, Ghostface, Inspectah Deck and GZA, \"Verbal Intercourse\" w/Nas, \"Criminology\", \"Incarcerated Scarfaces\", \"Wu Gambinos\" and \"Rainy Dayz\".  This CD remained in heavy rotation for awhile and is definitely one of my favorite Wu Tang CDs of all time.  In 1999, Raekwon released&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Immobilarity/dp/B000034D0D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Immobilarity</a>.

Raekwon could definitely handle things on Wu Tang Clan CD's as well as CDs from Ghostface, but these last 2 CDs didn't work for me at all.  It was announced as early as 2005 that Raekwon's \"Cuban Linx 2\" would be released on Dr. Dre's, Aftermath Records, and the CD was delayed numerous times.  Finally in 2009, although it wasn't released on Aftermath, Raekwon released \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx 2\".  He released a single, \"The New Wu\", which was produced by RZA and featured Ghostface and Method Man.  This was definitely a good sign of what was to come from the CD.  \"House Of Flying Daggers\" is produced by the late, great J Dilla and features Inspectah Deck, Ghostface and Method Man.  This song is definitely one of my favorite tracks as the aim is to take it back to the \"Protect Ya Neck\" days and the Dilla track allows them to do that.  \"Cold Outside\", which features Ghostface, will take you back to the classics such as \"Heaven And Hell\", \"Can It Be All So Simple\" and \"Rainy Dayz\". \"Gihad\" will having you laughing because of the story told by Ghostface in his verse and the beat by Necro will definitely have this song in your Top 5 favorites.  Jadakiss and Styles P join in on \"Broken Safety\", which is produced by Scram Jones.  This track, although it's short, will have you think that Raekwon was the 4th member of the LOX. You would think they had been rappin' together for years.  Beanie Sigel shows up on \"Have Mercy\" and this track works as well.  This verse is better than anything I heard on \"The Solution\", which is the last CD that I purchased from Beanie.  \"We Will Rob You\" has Slick Rick on the hook and GZA and Masta KIlla join Raekwon to make this another nice collaboration.  Dr. Dre produces 2 tracks \"Catalina\" which features singer Lyfe Jennings and \"About Me\", which features another former Aftermath artist, Busta Rhymes.  The tracks definitely sound dated but things still end up working in both cases.  The J Dilla produced \"Ason Jones\", is a tribue to ODB and things definitely work well here as you hear heartfelt words from Rae and another Dilla beat that will have you wishing he was still here with us today.There isn't too much that I find wrong with this CD.  In my opinion, there are definitely too many interludes and short tracks.  However, because of the quality of the majority of the interludes, most listeners will be able to get past this.  Some of the songs do sound dated, but you have to remember that Raekwon said the album was finished in 2006 originally.  Now one thing that some people will have a problem with is the subject matter that is involved with this CD.  Raekwon is 41 years old and he is still talking about things that he talked about 14 years ago on the original \"Cuban Linx\"  CD.  Some people have no problem with that and some people will want Rae to, even at this age, come up with a new formula.Overall, this is Raekwon's best solo effort since the \"purple tape\" and it's the best Wu solo effort that I have heard since \"Fishscale\".  You still get nice lyrics from Raekwon, Wu Tang Clan and other artists such as Jadakiss, Styles P and Beanie Sigel.  You also get nice production from RZA, J Dilla, Dr. Dre, Alchemist, Erick Sermon, Marley Marl, Scram Jones and others.

Raekwon picks up right where he left off and what you hear is great beats, on point lyrics and tracks from some of the best producers now (and this time RZA isn't the only one who creates all the hot beats here.) The only reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars is because tracks from Marley Marl and Erick Sermon were too damn short and Nas wasn't recruited to do a guest spot this time.Whatever good stuff that has been said by other reviewers is true and on point.

{"text": "In 2006, Raekwon made two announcements: One; He's making a sequel to his classic debut, \"Only Built For Cuban Linx\", and Two; He was signing to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. While one was exciting (the former), the other was a little disheartening (the latter). Being that Dr. Dre is a bit of a nitpicker, he has a tendency to shelve albums...just ask King Tee, Rakim, and Stat Quo. So, when months and even years passed by, this album started to become existent in name only. It was scheduled for a late 2008 release, but Dr. Dre wasn't happy with the results. Also, the album's executive producer (and Raekwon's labelmate) Busta Rhymes had left Aftermath, which put the project into limbo. So, Raekwon took the masters and left for EMI Records to put out \"Only Built For Cuban Linx, Part II\".Fast forward to 2009, when the album actually sees the light of day. After hearing the album, I have to ask Dr. Dre one serious question... \"What Were You Thinking?\"  This album is a masterpiece from beginning to end, even with its obvious flaws (22 songs...really?). Production on this album is almost flawless, with production from Marley Marl, Pete Rock, The RZA, The Alchemist and the late J. Dilla. Even the two songs that Dr. Dre contributed don't sound out of place.While I love this album enough to say that it is the best hip hop album of 2009, I do have a couple of gripes with it.

The Chef's storytelling skills are still amazing with precise attention paid to every detail and I can't get enough of his chemistry with Ghostface Killah (I wish he had appeared on more than seven out of 22 tracks but he does his usual damage).

Well, I actually love everything on here and Ason Jones, an ODB tribute is so touching that it brought tears to my eyes. This is the one to buy people.

And not sure what song it is, but there is one with a hook that says something like, \"get money anyway you can\" or \"do whatever you gotta do to get money\"...Really ?  i thought we progressed from that mental state ?  obviously im wrong.  Maybe im listening to too much roots, mos def, and talib.  yeah that could be it.  but i also listen to boot camp clik all day so im not sure.  i don't know, i keep playing it over and over again trying to see if it will grow on me but its not workingby the way, when amazon asks you if this review was helpful, IT IS NOT asking you if you approve of the review or agree or disagree with the review, why cant you people get that???  its simple\n", "val": 2.9259388611535542e-05}

{"text": "To me this is not an instant classic & doesn't have the same feeling as the 1st one, but that being said, it is already a classic in my opinion. Let me explain why. The first time I heard this album was with my friend, he was the first one to cop it since there was only ONE COPY in my cd store! Lucky son of a [...], anyway the first time I heard it I found it to be a great Banger with a little VVu-vibe. Nothing more, nothing less. Although little did I know & was soon to realize that this Killa Bee had already stung me. I guess my anticipations were too high but even that being the case, I knew I had to buy it. I finally did order it last week right here on amazon and I am very happy I did. The only tracks I wasn't feeling at first were: Black Mozart (dunno why?), Baggin' Crack (I found it to be so-so, hadn't really listened to the lyrics), Canal Street (I thought why take this old [...] beat?) & Mean Streets. Which I have to say isn't much out of 22 tracks. On the second try, I was really starting to feel the vibe and was soon forgetting what I thought to be the bad parts of it. This album really grew on me fast, kind of like a plague but a good one! Now I can say it is a classic, it has been in constant rotation ever since I got it. (Only 3 days ago) & it's not moving anytime soon. It's also hands down the best album out this year 2009 (that was easy). The reason why it doesn't have the same feeling as it's predecessor is simply because: number 1 it's modern (they had to evolve with their sound to keep up with modern-day Hip-Hop) and number 2 OB4CL Part 1 was about him coming up, in part 2 he already did so it is much more grown-up, he already has the wealth, the fame, the bling, his Hip-Hop status but stays gutter nonetheless & did not forget where he came from. Raekwon actually feels really hungry on here to my surprise & so does the rest of the clan it really feels like they're still a family, and there are great appearances! There is not one guest on this album I am not feeling, Busta is a nice surprise! Everybody puts in their 2 cents to shine and it really shows. It also feels like he tried to recreate OB4CL and in my opinion he did a really great job. Here's why: On Part 1 there were alot of instant classics like Ice Cream, Incarcerated Scarfaces, Criminology, etc. Same thing for Part 2: House Of Flying Daggers, New Wu, We Will Rob You... Penitentiary to me kind of feels like Criminology, Cold Outside kind of like Rainy Dayz, New Wu like Ice Cream yet different. They used the same elements that made the first one a classic and that is what makes this sequel so perfect. Except with a little more Chef and less RZA. You would think the lack of RZA to be a big problem but it barely is, we could of used more GZA on here but oh well, I guess we can't have everything. I'm guessing he was busy... They've all got lives now, they probably have families to take care of so they can't dedicate as much time to Hip-Hop as they used to. That being said, as we can hear all over this album they don't want to see the Fat Lady Sing.The bottom line is this album is dope from start to finish, it made me love Hip-Hop all over again & is a definite five stars, I would give it more if I could! For those who disagree maybe you should give it another try, there is absolutely nothing sell-out about this one, it does not in any way feel lazy & Raekwon really brings the ruckus with his lyrics. It is nice to see big names in Hip-Hop support The Chef, like Slick Rick, Busta Rhymes, Styles, Jada, Sigel. People who keep it real. The ODB tribute Ason Jones is really heartfelt & we can feel how important he still is to the clan. I also love the originality & freshness of this cd, the beats are great, you would think after all these years it would sound old but that is not the case. Like I said before it isn't an instant classic but it isn't far from it & I am sure it will grow on you quickly just as it did the same thing for me. If you haven't bought it yet then what are you waiting for? Support Hip-Hop & go get it RIGHT NOW, you don't know what you're missing.\n", "val": 0.0007893543806858361}

{"text": "While not exactly a concept album, Raekwon's 1995 solo debut Only Built for Cuban Linx, is considered by many to be one of the greatest gangsta films to ever be put on wax. Even back then, tales of sex, drugs, murder, and betrayal were nothing new to hip-hop; yet no one had been able to illustrate them with quite the cinematic quality that Raekwon was on Cuban Linx (think Scarface: The Musical). It was the album that essentially launched the sub-genre known as Coke-rap, which enjoyed a surge of popularity back in 2006 with Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury, and more recently with Rick Ross' Deeper Than Rap.Gangster films rarely ever get sequels, though, since the main players usually end up dead or in jail by the end of the film. When they do get made, they often rarely deserve to share shelf-space with their predecessors. After 14 years, the Wu-Tang resident chef returns with his attempt at a true sequel to his own classic, appropriately titled Only Built for Cuban Linx II. But Linx II doesn't so much continue a story more than it continues the themes (deals-gone-bad, treacherous partnerships gone sour, and familial bonds kept strong) that were laced throughout the original. The result is an epic combination of lethal beats, vivid lyrics, and cut-ya-head-off swagger that has been missing from so many of the more recent Wu-tang releases.The album's lead single, \"New Wu\" (alternatively titled Wu Ohh), was something that die-hard Wu fans thought they may never hear again after last year's dreadful 8 Diagrams: stunningly soulful production from the RZA himself with guest verses from Ghost and Meth. RZA (who single-handedly produced the first Cuban Linx) is all over Linx II, even when he isn't; J Dilla does his best impression of the Wu Abbot's style on \"House of Flying Daggers\" (which also features Ghost and Meth along with Inspectah Deck), and returns to handle production on the ODB tribute, \"Ason Jones.\" Along with the departed Dilla, Raekwon gathered beats from the best producers around; Alchemist, Pete Rock, and even Dr. Dre contribute enough heat to this product to make it harden.The beats aren't the only reason to tune in, however. Wu-Tang members GZA, Cappadonna, and the ever-reclusive Masta Killa make appearances sprinkled throughout the album. Jadakiss, who seems to be sort of a journeyman of guest appearances these days, shows up along with Styles P on \"Broken Safety.\" Beanie Sigel drops by on \"Have Mercy\" to acknowledge and contemplate his own sense of aging. \"Gihad\" pretty much belongs to Ghostface Killah, who spins a dramatic tale of an altercation with his son in a verse which will remind heads why he belongs in their list of top rappers working today.If it sounds like Cuban Linx II has the ingredients of a classic album, it's because it does. This is an album that's greater than the sum of its parts; Cuban Linx II should have been a total disappointment, yet it actually exceeds the standards created by its own hype. This isn't some hollow flash-in-the-pan collection of tracks to keep heads bopping only until the next big thing comes along; this is music that lasts. Hip-hop fans will be decoding the wu-slanguistics on this album for years, which hasn't been done with a Wu-tang release since the Forever days. After the recent wave of pretenders to the coke-rap throne, the originator has made a refreshing return to the game to show how it's done.Grade: A\n", "val": 0.019834505394101143}

They don't give off that head bob notion that the first Links did.The lyrics are good, but in this day in age, it's the beats and hooks that hold a good track together.Overall, i think Ghost and Rae lyrically put down that same style and collabo that make them two of the best unofficial rap duo out there.  But it's missing something that the original Links had.  Like most sequels, it fails to meet the original.  I think this album is about 8-10 years too late. The producers of this album would have done better to release it under a different name.  Links is one of the best rap albums of all times and this sequel just doesn't measure up.\n", "val": 0.0001745053887134418}

{"text": "This is a short review, just wanted to tell the people who didn't like the album very much at first (like myself) that after another 2 or 3 listens, you will fell into total addiction to it. The most amazing thing about this album is its consistency, almost every song is great. I don't really like \"Cold Outside\" nor \"Kiss The Ring\" (a little cheesy), still some people consider them highlights so I guess it's alright.Ahhh something else, this album is very reminiscent of \"8 Diagrams\", I know that there are a lot of different producers but a lot of the beats have the same kinda vibe, I guess it's the new wu tang clan vibe. If you like this (sonically) listen to \"8 Diagrams\" which is a great album, although lyrically is almost opposite, \"8 diagrams\" has (almost) no drug-related lyrics nor violence stuff. It's more like some \"inner-power\" kinda lyrics. Those are like the 2 faces ofs the WU TANG CLAN: The street, criminal, bad attitude stuff, and the spiritual, mentally challenging, inner-knowledge stuff. That duality is the coolest and most powerful thing about Wu Tang Clan.And well yes, the first \"Cuban Linx\" was better, and Ghostface Killah's \"Supreme Clientele\" and \"Fishcale\" are also better than this one, in my opinion. I had to tell the truth. Those albums are downright powerful. But this is really close. Cheers.\n", "val": 0.02963445894420147}

{"text": "This album took a couple listens to grow on me, but if I rated Cuban Linx 1 a 9.5, Cuban Linx 2 is about a 9.  There are some diverse beats, but I think I'm biased towards RZA beats, so naturally \"Black Mozart\" and \"New Wu\" gave me that nostalgic Wu-banger feeling that we've been missing in the music scene for awhile but with a new set of samples.  Even the Dr. Dre produced tracks (a hip hop head would recognize Dre's signature piano hooks, and \"the Killer\" movie sample before \"Catalina\" even says, \"Don't disturb the doctor\") toward the end of the album have a Wu feel to them.  This made me kinda wish there could be a Dr. Dre vs. Wu's classic songs album, because his pianos and beats (at least these ones) fit in with Wu-style beats/lyrics.  This album doesn't use as many gangster-movie samples as the first Cuban Linx, which makes Cuban Linx 2 feel like it lacks the narrative of the first, but the two albums are similar in the way they don't frontload all of the good songs (we see too much of this in today's pick and choose iTunes/mp3 music scene).  Also sorely missed is Nas, the album has some other non-Wu features, but I was looking forward to hearing more Nas Escobar on this.  Definitely listen to the album all the way through or else you'll miss some gems towards the end.  I actually liked some of the Dre songs, at least they tried to keep the Wu-vibe, it was interesting to me to hear a Dre-produced Wu-Tang track.

{"text": "Let me start by saying that I've been a huge rap fan for nearly a decade now. Born and raised in NY, I've especially loved everything about classic east-coast rap; the eclectic and daring beats, the raw, gritty flows, and of course, the unsurpassed lyrical content. Any Wu-Tang fan knows exactly what I'm talking about.Only Built For Cuban Linx, the original, has always been one of my favorite Wu solo albums, second only to GZA's Liquid Swords. I've followed Raekwon's past two efforts and have been disappointed by them, as most fans were. Rae's follow-up has been delayed for some time now, but it has been absolutely worth the wait. Yes, Only Built For Cuban Linx PT2 is not only an incredible album, but an instant classic. This album has everything, from the beats that put Wu on the map, to the brilliantly fluid lyricism that kept them there. Raekwon really listened to fan feedback on this, and it shows. My only gripe is that the LP should have some more RZA production, but I guess that's just me being nostalgic.All the production is on point, so there's little to complain about in that department. OBFCL2 actually follows a storyline which began with the original album over 14 years ago, which is another reason why it's so brilliant. I know a lot of people who went out to cop this album along with Blueprint 3, but the two are totally incomparable. While Jay-Z has really sold himself out this time, Rae kept his material as raw and hypnotizing as ever.Some favorite tracks:. New Wu. House of Flying Daggers. Black Mozart. Gihad. 10 Bricks. Kiss The RingHonestly, out of the 22 tracks, I'm in love with 19 of them. And I'm picky. If you're a fan of some classic Wu-Tang sounds, and you're sick of garbage auto-tuned music with elementary school rhymes from the likes of Lil Wayne, GO GET THIS ALBUM.

{"text": "For anyone not familiar with true hip-hop (not to be mistaken for \"hip-pop\"), Cuban Linx II does more than just recapture the good ol' days, it surpasses it's on original legacy as quite possibly the greatest rap album of all time. Yea that's right, I said, \"of all time\"!In an era where mumbling 3rd grade jingles over what I'm assuming some people call beats nowadays, & the ever present (& formerly taboo) artform of \"biting\" & \"copy-catting\", Shallah Raekwon & Ghostface Killah deliver the rap equivilent to what Al Pacino & Robert DeNiro would sound like if they where hip-hop artists making music together. The stories are incredible, the lyrics are breathtaking, the chemistry is undeniable, & the production is masterful. Every track paints vivid pictures of urban streetlife illustrated brilliantly by Rae, Ghost, & a host of some of hip-hop's most potent storytellers.From the opening track on \"House of Flying Daggers\" (prod. by the late great J-Dilla), Inspectah Deck does what he does best & that's set the bar extremely high with his opening bar \"I pop off like a mobster boss/angel hair with the lobster sauce...\", that's followed one track later by the short & ghetto-angelic \"Pyrex Vision\", which has Rae calmly taking you through the thoughts of a coke cooker.  \"Cold Outside\" is a dark tale of the unpredictable lifestyle associated with crime & poverty. \"Black Mozart\" demonstrates RZA's potent production style while Rae & Deck skate across the bassline effortlessly into the album's best track so far.Not to be outdone, on the very next track \"Gihad\", Ghostface raps \"...you gonna kill me over this bum-[...] you can't resist?...\" as he pleads with his \"son\" before taking control of the situation & instructing the lil man to \"put a steak on his eye\" after punching him in the face & securing the gun -classic! Then, in creeps the vintage, melodic \"New Wu\", featuring Ghost & Method Man. Mef shines on this one & one can only scratch his head & wonder why the hell Buddens would call this cat out. \"Penetentiary\" is a cool-[...] tale about the prison life & is followed by another short, but classic track \"Baggin' Crack\" produced by E. Sermon. \"Surgical Gloves\" is the perfect name for the next track as Rae surgically goes to work on this Alchemist produced banger. The next track \"Broken Safety\" has Jadakiss & Styles P. joining the Cuban Link legacy while the heartfelt \"Ason Jones\" provides a nice emotional break from the killing & drug dealing. \"Have Mercy\" immediately follows & it features an explosive verse from B-Sigel while Blue Raspberry from the original Cuban Linx' \"Rainy Dayz\", provide the vocal backdrop for this classic duet between Rae & Sigel. The next track \"10 Bricks\" (again prod. by Dilla) quickly grows on me (alot!). I replay this one before continuing. After another classic short story on \"Fat Lady Sings\", Rae & Lyfe Jennings give the album it's first real mainstream feel with the harmonious \"Catalina\" prod. by Dr. Dre. \"We Will Rob You\" feat. Slick Rick, GZA, & Masta Killa provides instant humor & the Dr. Dre produced \"About Me\" feat. Busta Rhymes keep the album's momentum going into the classic outro \"Kiss the Ring\". This track feat. Masta Killa & INS the Rebel boasting to the rap world to give it up to \"the best that ever done it\". Quite frankly, I agree with these guys. No rap entity has provided hip-hop the quality & quanity that of the Wu-Tang Clan's.

{"text": "Everyone has been making fun of Raekwon for years for constantly pushing this album back to the point of absurdity; a lot of people expected this to suck.I, for one, expected this to be good, though, and it is. Raekwon isn't one of my favorite rappers, but I still consider him to be basically untouchable in some ways. I don't think he's really ever put out anything wack... his songs and verses generally range from brilliant to average, in my opinion. People have complained about his flow seeming lazy lately. Well, that never bothered me, because to me he was still doing some really brilliant delivery and wording; I thought he was excellent on 8 Diagrams, for instance. But anyway, he does not sound lazy on this album, so you need not worry about that.So, this album... it is really really solid. Very good, and interesting, beats. Some very good RZA beats, too. All around great performances from all MCs involved. A lot of Wu features, like there should be in an album of this title. Excellent contributions from Ghostface (again, as there should be in an album of this title.)I think it is interesting, the Wu Tang Clan have struggled for years to maintain/regain their former stature and prestige. This year, though, it seems they have finally gotten their act together. Blackout 2 was also very good, and U-God finally released a consistently good album. They may never regain the spotlight, but I think the fact that they are still able to create such solid albums in 2009 shows that their reputation was not undeserved.EDIT: I wrote that review after having listened to the whole album once... since then I skipped around on it for awhile, and now I am more than halfway through a second straight listening of it.

I was concerned with it being 22 tracks, but I haven't found a track worth skipping yet, so I guess that means no filler, right?The production rarely misses, and has an old school feel yet still sounds fresh in 2009. Almost every track is a head nodder with a nice groove. Chef and Ghost are on point throughout, and the guests don't disappoint either. I just wish ODB was around to be on this, though his tribute track Ason Jones is an album highlight (though not quite as good as Life Changes off 8 Diagrams IMO).Hard to pick favorite songs off the album since there are so many good ones, but I'd go with:  10 Bricks, Gihad, Black Mozart, New Wu, Pyrex Vision (its too short!), Sonny's Missing, Baggin Crack, and Surgical Gloves.I'll have to give it some more time, but for me either OB4CL2 or Fishscale are the best Wu releases since the classic Supreme Clientele, with Muggs & GZA's Grandmasters a close 3rd.A must buy, especially considering how much BS is out there in hip hop these days.

It lacked any kind of creativity in concepts, themes, or beats. The best era of the Wu was directly between their first and second albums because of the extreme originality and solidly themed albums. I've still been buying their albums for years wanting a new Cuban Linx, Iron Man, Liquid Swords, Tical, or Return to the 36 Chambers. It's like being in love with a girl and it hasn't felt the same for a while, but you remember how they first made you feel. I listened to purple tape back to back to back when I was on the phone with my first telephone girlfriend. It made me stop listening to Tical as much.Furthermore, this wasn't a true sequel nothing close to the joints they used to make like Ice Cream, Verbal Intercourse, or Glaciers of Ice. I'm not mad Raekwon got my money, but won't be going into rotation. Wait for MF Doom, 9th Wonder, Danger Mouse, or some other cat trying to make a name for himself to do a remix album. I'm thinking of how Grandmasters was actually pretty good, but the remix album made it a bit better.Wu stopped being hot when they stopped being creative. When they told Nas he needed to be the old Nas, he changed even more and got better every time.

{"text": "This is easily the best album of the year and the answer to all those who said that The Chef fell off. Ghostface, Meth, INS, and all of the other Wu members on here all come hard on this and produce an incredible album.1. Return Of The North Star - This takes you right back into the scheme of things and even has the same sample as North Star (Jewels). Papa Wu is entertaining as awlways here. ****2. House Of Flying Daggers - This is pretty much Guillotine '09. Inspectah Deck tears this track up, but just when you think it's it, Method Man steals the show with his verse. His flow is insane. The late great J Dilla provides an awesome beat that sets the atmosphere of this track. *****3. Sonny's Missing - And they say that Pete Rock lost it. He drops a great jazzy and ominous sounding beat while raekwon provides an entertaining story about kidnapping and killing an enemy. ****4. Pyrex Vision - The legend Marley Marl provides a great guitar sampled beat as Raekwon talks about baking crack. Man, if only this song were longer because Marley Marl's beat is awesome. ****5. Cold Outside - Eh...the beat for this one came off as a little over the top, but the lyrics are solid. Tony Starks aka Ghostface Killah is entertaining as always. ****6. Black Mozart - RZA drops the first of only 2 beats here. Rebel INS and Raekwon both drop great verses here about getting money and the like. ****7. New Wu - This is one of my favorite tracks on the album. Also known as Back From The Slums, RZA's beat is fantastic and Ghostface kills it. *****8. Penitentiary - I'll probably have to give this one a few more listens, but it was entertaining the few times I've heard it. ****9. Gihad - Oh man, I love this track. Ghostface just goes off. Sure, some people thought all of his explicit talk was kinda unneccesary, but that's just Ghostface being Ghostface and that's why I love it. *****10. Surgical Gloves - This is easily my favorite song on the album. The Alchemist's beat is SICK and Raekwon goes in as his laid black flow perfectly complements the track.11. Broken Safety - Jadakiss kills this one. \"The Economy is down, so that means there's gonna be a lot of homi's in the town.\" Fantastic *****12. Canal Street - Like with Penitentiary, I'll have to give this another listen. Great cinematic beat, though ****13. Ason Jones - This was a great tribute to ODB. *****14. Have Mercy - Blue Raspberry once again provides great singing while Beanie Sigel drops a fantastic verse about the trials of living in a prison cell. *****15. 10 Bricks - Another great J Dilla beat here. Ghostface and Raekwon once again show their chemistry together and even Cappadonna's good. ****16. Fat lady Sings - The attention to detail on this track is good, although for some reason I wasn't really feeling it. ***16. Catalina - Dr. Dre's beat here is great as Raekwon reminisces about his actions in the past. ****17. We Will Rob You - This is a banger. Slick Rick's great on the hook and everyone brings it. Anyone else notice how Masta Killa sounds like 50 Cent pre-shooting? *****18. About Me - Dr. Dre provides his signature piano beat and Raekwon once again brings the heat ****.The last tracks were kinda weak, and I'd give them both **** each.Overall, this is as good of a sequel as we're gonna get. Raekwon and everyone on the album made sure that it would be great and it really is the AOTY.\n", "val": 0.04161326587200165}

One thing is that even those 3 are good it's just when you compare 20 other bangers that sometimes 3 might sound okay and not matching up.  Plainly this is lightyears above the other stuff Raekwon has done solo lately as far as albums go (I'm not talking about his collabs).  To give a review the album follows a plot and a story line of a dealer's view of the streets, his life and stories.  It keeps you in the feel of watching a movie and his songs do not stray away from this theme and the beats are not monotonous Rae's relaxed flow doesn't get boring because he changes it up a little and in his storytelling you can identify with his narration.  That's enough of me writing.  This album is a classic.  It's great.  Ghostface is good and really does not outshine Rae (as he usually does). I wish Slick Rick would have given a verse and it killed me when he didn't. Right now I'm putting this above BP3 and saying this album right here is a rare gem worth it.

{"text": "The central irony of hip hop is its insistence on authenticity, when in fact, the rappers themselves live a life far removed from the gritty streets they describe.  In Rae's case, he doesn't even live in NYC anymore; he has since moved to Atlanta to enjoy a more bucolic lifestyle.  But such a point misses the true statement of hip hop, an insistence on *artistic* authenticity, which few can uphold with the same sincerity as Rae.  Each of these gems gleams with lurid tales of murder and hustling, evoking not so much the true state of the city as an exaggerated past.  Raekwon's OB4CL2 is an ode to a bygone era of his youth, and while the larger than life crime stories he presents are highly apocryphal, they constitute a cohesive artistic vision of New York's dark underworld.I was nervous that the years this album spent in development hell implied it would be a stinker, but happily, I couldn't have been more wrong.  It's still too soon to say whether it lives up to the original, but so far, it's hard to be disappointed with what we're hearing.  Rae and Ghost are like two sides of the same coin while other guest appearances add polish without stealing the limelight from the author.  Cop it now, because this is hip hop at its best--there's no excuse for complaining that the golden age of rap is over when giants still stand in our midst!\n", "val": 0.00015981461910996586}
{"text": "\"Don't call it a comeback\". That was back in '91, but those words still stand true today. Raekwon is back but did he really ever go anywhere? He was featured on Ghostface Killah's \"The Pretty Toney Album\" & \"Fishscale\". He was all over Wu Tang's last 2 CD's. He guest starred on songs by The Game, Busta Rhymes & Jadakiss. He has not disappeared, but with no major label releases in the last 6 years and 14 years removed from a classic, his name has been an afterthought in hip hop.The buzz around \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...Part  II\" surfaced 3 years ago. The problem was Rae had trouble finding a label and distribution. With this album, he will not have that problem anymore. \"...Cuban Linx Part II\" picks up right where the first one left off with Poppa Wu doing the monologue on \"Return of the North Star\". Icewater flips a sample of the movie \"The Godfather 2\" on \"Cold Outside\", where Rae and Ghost go into their classic storytelling flow. \"Ason Jones\" is dedicated to fallen Wu member ODB.  Method Man does the hook on \"New Wu\" which sounds alot like \"Ice Cream\". Near the end, OB4CL2 loses a little edge. \"Have Mercy\" ft Beanie Sigel does not fit with the vibe of the album. \"Catalina\" ft Lyfe Jennings & \"We Will Rob You\" ft Slick Rick just aren't as good as the rest of the album. But the album ends on a high note with \"Kiss The Ring\" ft. Inspector Deck & Masta Killa. This album is a perfect sequel to a classic. Though it will never be better than the original, it holds its own against anything put out in the last 5 years.The production on this album is top notch. Of course there's RZA, GZA and Allah Mathematics, but old school producers like Pete Rock, Marley Marl & Eric Sermon also contributed. Dr. Dre lent a hand on a couple tracks. Newcomers like BT, Icewater and Scram Jones impressed me. And I don't know how he does it, but J-Dilla has 3 tracks. It amazes me how he still produces 3 years after his death.Wu Tang Clan has been a force in hip hop since 1993. Each member has brought their own style to the masses. After ODB died and Meth disappeared, Wu looked like a fallen empire with only a couple survivors left waving the flag. Ghost held the fort down for years, but Wu Tang has been on life support since 2004. With this CD, Rae has single handedly resurrected the Clan. And with new albums from Ghost and Meth dropping later this year, it doesn't seem like they going away anytime soon.  Long live the Wu.\n", "val": 9.81834382400848e-05}

To me, this new Raekwon album is a breath of fresh air for 2009.If 'Only Built 4 Cuban Linx' is a 5-Star CLASSIC hip-hop album, 'Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, Pt. 2' should easily be rated 4-1/2 Stars, an INSTANT CLASSIC as well. The only reason for 1/2-Star deduction is because rapper Nas couldn't join Raekwon for the follow-up to \"Verbal Intercourse\" (Nas was going through his divorce with Kelis, so his absence is understandable).Regardless, if you're reading this you owe it to yourself to buy this album and support the original pioneer of Mafioso Rap, Raekwon (who inspired Jay-Z's 'Reasonable Doubt', and The Notorious B.I.G.'s 'Life After Death', among many others). If you've never heard the original Raekwon album 'Only Built 4 Cuban Linx', I urge you to buy it and listen to it back-to-back with this new Raekwon album right here.To Raekwon: I want to personally say THANK YOU for bringing back CLASSIC 90's style rap into 2009 for all hip-hop fans.THIS ALBUM IS A MUST-BUY.\n", "val": 0.01896083541214466}

{"text": "The past 9-10 years hasn't really been too kind to the hip-hop community, musically and creatively speaking. In a lot of ways the grit, grime and humble beginnings of rap music in the late 80's into the 90's gave way to glitz, glamour, \"flashing lights\" and \"high life\" of hip-hop music in this decade.  You can thank Jay-Z for that. If you can't relate to the struggles of daily life in the projects I guess it's not too bad to rap about the good life with nice cars and hot women.That's not necessarily a bad thing, but when everyone else starts copying that it gets too much.  Besides, rap music originated in the streets, not the mansions.  It feels like forever that we had a good Wu related album.  But in reality it's not THAT long.  Ghostface Killah had 2 great albums in this decade with Fishscale and Supreme Clientele.  But with hardcore rap it's been way too long or at least not too often.  It seemed like in the 90's we had at least 3 excellent hardcore-gangsta rap albums a year. But now it's become watered-down \"safe\" top 40 rap music.  While 50 Cent had a nice boom there with that one album of his, lyrically speaking and let's be honest here, the guy was no more creative or clever than a 15 year old kid.  But at least he had some catchy beats to keep you interested.Now this album from Raekwon has been delayed a couple of times.  I think this release date is just about right, just after Labor Day weekend.  Plus the hype only built up after hearing a couple of songs. On 'House Of Flying Daggers' you hear GZA's verse from 'Clan In Da Front' from the first Wu album 'Return To The 36 Chambers'. Just hearing this song makes you realize that you have something great going on here.  One of the best songs from Rae & Wu in many years.  Everybody here makes an appearance and most importantly they all brought back the fire, the desire and the hunger to be great once again.  Lyrically speaking they've went back in time at least 10-15 years to when they always writing edgy and slick lyrics. The beats are also back too.  It's almost as if the mediocrity of the last 10 years never happened. I can't put enough emphasis on this but this is a true return to form Rae and his Wu counterparts.  I know that term is thrown around rather loosely but in this case I really mean it. Now I hope they can sustain this for future releases.  Because not only do WE need it, but the hip-hop industry needs it just as much, if not more.  It may be only a day old as I write this. But this album will go down as a classic.\n", "val": 0.0009113886044360697}

{"text": "After several years (and delays) Raekwon the Chef (along with Tony Starks) releases his second masterpiece. \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Only-Built-4-Cuban-Linx/dp/B000002WU9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</a>\" is still an amazing album. Like most classics in rap or hip-hop, Raekwon's fist joint ages like fine wine.  If you haven't listened to said classic, check it out now.\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...Part 2\" is another classic (albeit with a more polished, '09 feel).  Raekwon, along with his Clansmen, step up and deliver street anthem after bloody street anthem.  Each track is mad \"niggerish\" (as Charley Murphy would say).\"Return of the North Star\" welcomes the listener back into Chef's Cuban Linx world. (Play both albums back-to-back.) \"House of Flying Daggers\" is a pure Wu-Banger.  \"New Wu,\" which most of us heard online, represents the Wu in the same vein as \"Triumph\" (or even \"Careful (Click, Click)\").  \"Surgical Gloves,\" \"Pyrex Vision,\" \"Penitentiary,\" and \"Baggin' Crack\" are perhaps my favorite tracks. (Raekwon can spin a story, son.) \"Ason Jones\" is a wonderful tribute to Big Baby Jesus. \"We Will Rob You\" and \"10 Bricks\" are some of the best displays of witty, unpredictable talent and natural game in recent years. Ghostface Killah slays the competition on these tracks.  And likewise, Method Man comes correct (and as grimy) as usual.Some of the aforementioned tracks are short (2 to 3 minutes or so). But the album clocks out at 1:10:52...so really, we get plenty of street knowledge.All in all, this album is a fitting sequel to one of the best albums we've ever heard.  Raekwon (and his posse) give us another standard in hip-hop lyricism and production.  (Thank God RZA produced several key tracks on this beast.)I keep telling people: Raekwon never fell off!  Hopefully...while all the shark biters are waiting...these Cats will smash the world again.Wu-Tang forever.Peace.\n", "val": 0.04231227561831474}

I waiting for that push to make it go to the next level, but throughout all 11 of the songs, it wasn't there. I have to say I was really disappointed with this album. Being a fan of their earlier work, I was thought this album would be a the second chapter in their music history. It really wasn't. The songs are similar to their sound, with the poppy guitars and lyrics about lovers in the past. It was just wasn't really something you'd take notice of. It was really bland, and weak second album.

{"text": "\"Love Drunk\" by Boys Like Girls is an effort clearly directed towards a younger audience. Calling it \"emo\" is surely not an overstatement. The adult audience in general is very likely to drop the album after a first listening, with some few exceptions (of course).If you know or heard somewhere a very well known group, called \"The All-American Rejects\" and try \"Love Drunk\", you are very likely to find several resemblances in both melodies and lyrics. Although I found this a \"not memorable\" album, trying it a couple times won't hurt at all. It is noticeable that they have poured their hearts and souls into doing these songs, and this is something worth of respect. But in the short run, this is a sort of record that will just get stuck, forgotten at the bottom of a shelf.\n", "val": 4.335220000939444e-05}
{"text": "The problem with Boys Like Girls' 2006 self-titled debut was that the group sounded like a mid-decade answer to earlier bands such as Simple Plan or Good Charlotte. It was easy to imagine putting various CDs into a stereo and hitting the shuffle button only to guess which group was blaring through the speakers. A few tracks share this on new sophomore set \"Love Drunk,\" but the majority retain distinct flavor.The verses surrounding the chorus of the Top 40 title track are probing and intriguing, and the jagged, fluctuating ear candy chorus of opening cut \"Heart Heart Heartbreak,\" another potential hit single, indicates that the band has grown stronger. \"The Real Thing,\" which smacks of Bon Jovi (in this case, a good thing) has an awesome lyric which works in all the right spots - relatable sans cliches, stream-of-conscious without being offbeat - as well as a winning, bombastic melody and awesome guitar riffs.These are the kinds of songs that stick around in the minds of listeners upon repeated plays without wearing out their welcome prematurely, and they make merely adequate tracks like \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" and the cute but less interesting \"Contagious\" sound better by rubbing against them.Of particular interest are the ballads, the best of which find the band hitting a particular stride and threshold of quality. It is a lyrically banal coming-of-age tune, but \"Someone Like You,\" with its solid, memorable melody and soul-searching, emotionally sincere vocal performance from frontman Martin Johnson elevate it to a stone cold winner. The lo-fi closer \"Go\" has beauty and bite,  and \"Two Is Better Than One,\" which is aided more by Taylor Swift's big-thing-of-the-moment star power than quality vocals (she does fine, but technically she is not ideal), is a potential monster hit with its sweeping arrangements and over-the-top romantic idealism. It is precision-tooled to win over legions of young women and annoy their boyfriends for extended lengths of time.\"Love Drunk\" is a sturdy collection of tunes that avoids the sophomore slump. Boys Like Girls up their ante considerably. This record is bound to spin off hits for at least a year.\n", "val": 0.021459612995386124}
{"text": "Since their first album didn't exactly take the U.S. by storm, I wasn't too surprised to hear that their sophomore effort leans much more on the pop side of pop punk, with the first three songs in particular crafted to do well on the Singles Charts.  Still, a good portion of this record will remind you of the first, and Boys Like Girls mix things up even more this time around with a few songs that try to connect with listeners on a deeper level.As mentioned, the first three songs use every trick in the production book to come up with some extremely catchy tunes.  \"Heart Heart Heartbreak\" combines what sounds like portions of The Scorpions' \"Rock You Like A Hurricane\" and Bon Jovi's \"You Give Love A Bad Name\" with plenty of trendy vocal effects to have you singing along quickly.  Likewise, \"Love Drunk\" and \"She's Got A Boyfriend Now\" use the latest favorite drum machine and synth sounds along with plenty of background \"Whoah, Ohahs\" and \"Heys\" to be as current as possible in the pop department, and I must say the results are sure to achieve their intended results...I'd be surprised if this record doesn't sell better than the first.  Even if you don't like this style, the good news is that no matter how these songs are produced, you still get frontman Martin Johnson's late '90's rock stylings, both vocally and melodically, scattered throughout the album.\"Two Is Better Than One\", featuring Taylor Swift, is the first of four songs that use a simple (but effective) approach in an attempt to move listeners emotionally...acoustic guitar, strings, real drums and a slight country flavor make this song one of the album's highlights.  Martin's vocals blend nicely with Taylor's, and there's a down-to-earth quality about this song that really makes it beautiful...at least it does for me.  A couple of somewhat straightforward BLG rockers are up next, with \"Contagious\" sounding like its beat is based on Toni Basil's \"Hey Micki (She's So Fine)\", and \"Real Thing\", which also starts itself off with classic '80s rock riffs in the verse before heading into a more conventional BLG chorus.\"Someone Like You\" is another one of the simply arranged, slower songs with good melody and lyrics (\"Running from Jesus\", \"Fighting My Demons\" in the chorus) that I find myself gravitating towards...this is a side of the band I'm really liking.  Another decent rocker follows (\"The Shot Heard 'Round The World), with fresh enough melodies and chord progressions that it doesn't sound too much like any other song, and for some reason starts off with several seconds of the sounds of heavy breathing.I really like \"The First One\", a mid tempo, melodic tune about your first broken heart being the worst, even though it isn't necessarily very original.  Some songs sound like they would fit well on the debut album, like \"Chemicals Collide\".Finally, \"Go\" uses acoustic guitar, cello and other string instruments along with interesting percussion as a backdrop to the final poignant, stripped-down but beautifully melodic piece of this record (ending as an instrumental).  Overall, there's a lot to like here, even as this album is less rock and more pop.\n", "val": 0.025676582008600235}

{"text": "In the span of time from their debut to their second album, \"Love Drunk,\" Boys Like Girls jump from punk-pop emo band to all out boy band power pop. This is not a completely bad thing, as the super sugar choruses and duet with Taylor Swift show. But the evolution is not without some speed bumps.First off, the good stuff. The lead off track, \"Heart Heart Heartbreak\" is pure adrenaline hormonal rush. The repetitive title kills it in the chorus, making for a great little earworm. Then the title track revisits the zing of their debut. Then comes the head scratcher. \"Two Is Better Than One\" is a ballad, but strip some of the electricity out of it and factor in Taylor Swift, and you have a country tune that would have fit just as nicely on one of Swift's albums than it does here. It also shows that lead singer/guitarist Martin Johnson can work his way around a sappy ballad with the best of them. It's the hookier tunes that play to the band's punkier roots, like \"Contagious\" that work the best.That's where things go somewhat awry. Propulsive emo-pop and power pop are great for the guys that need girls and the girls that break their hearts. But the new addition of strings and syrup (like the closer, \"Go,\" which limps the album to its end) make for the kind of song the band isn't quite up to yet. Add a southern accent and ditch the auto-tune, and these would be country ballads. While they make this country pop hybrid work much better on the follow-up, \"Crazy World,\" it's a tough sell on \"Love Drunk.\" It's as if Boys Like Girls suddenly took on a split personality and couldn't decide it they wanted to stay true to their Boston Emo roots or just pack up the cats and relocate to Nashville.That's the issue with \"Love Drunk.\" You get two distinct bands on this album, the whiz-bang pop of the debut, and the country-pop that would dominate the next album. Boys Like Girls were in transition, and while \"Love Drunk\" did debut in the top ten, their three albums are essentially the work in progress of differing mindsets. There's plenty to like on the album. What there isn't? Consistency. Hence the solid C grade.\n", "val": 0.0017919677775353193}

This album was both.Let's start with the good. While most are familiar with \"Love Drunk\" and \"Two is Better Than One\" thanks to repetitive radio waves, my favorites were actually \"Someone Like You\" and \"Go.\" Yes, both of them are ballads, but what struck me was the depth behind them. People want something that they can identify with, and soul-searching and sorrow are easily accessible human emotions, as is a sense of loss. For that same reason, \"She's Got a Boyfriend Now\" is another one of my likes from this album.Now, for the bad. To be blunt, \"The Shot Heard Round The World\" was a fail. There just wasn't anything remarkable about it, and I find myself skipping the track whenever it starts to play. It's a whole lot of clanging and crashing that signifies nothing. \"Chemicals Collide\" was just as forgettable but thankfully, not as annoying.On the whole, it's an okay album.

Knives were downstairs though.  Clearly their target audience has shifted decisively toward people with training bras.The next day I gave it all a second listen, thinking I wasn't in the mood or something.  I really liked most of the first one after all.  But no!  It was just as annoying, hooray!So...there's too much electronic BS.  They had these things in the first album, what are they called...guitars and drums.  Hard to tell now.  That wouldn't really matter except the songs are genuinely so much worse than the first.  Some seem to start off alright but the choruses almost all fell flat.  So many times I thought \"that's it?\"  The answer was \"yes\".But let's see, in order to salvage something from this, Shot Heard 'Round the World is okay.

{"text": "Previous reviews caused me to think twice before purchasing this extraordinary performance.  This is the real deal, the glowing voices of Jussi Bjoerling and Renata Tebaldi - the proud resolve of Birgit Nilsson's Turandot - and the rich orchestral sound in stereo directed with passion by Eric Leinsdorf.  It is the recording I loved in the late '60s.  Do not question to purchase this incredible bargain.\n", "val": 0.05545278266072273}
{"text": "I don't know how these two reviews got tacked onto this recording (and, yes, the mp3 of the Leinsdorf recording is just the left channel -- too bad!), but this is a whole different ball of wax, so to speak. Inge Borkh was well known for this role but much more famous for her Elektra and Salome potrayals as well as for her championing of contemporary opera roles (Orff's Antigone, for example). This recording catches Ms. Borkh in her prime, and for decades has been one of my favorite recordings of the role. She brings an emotional intensity that to me is lacking in the otherwise excellent versions by Nilsson and Sutherland. Her Calaf, Mario del Monaco, is, well, Mario Del Monaco. Some like it, some don't. While I prefer Franco Corelli (the Nilsson/Corelli recording is vastly underrated) Del Monaco does just fine by me. Alberto Erede is a solid conductor who knows the score and his orchestra well, and the sound is perfectly acceptable early stereo. This recording deserves a better rating that it receives because of the two misplaced reviews. For the price it is well worth your time.\n", "val": 0.02425837330520153}
{"text": "Having owned this recording since c. 1978, first on LP, then in two cd incarnations, it was immediately obvious to me from listening to the excerpts that these mp3s present the left channel only of the original stereo recording.  A previous reviewer noted that at one point in Act II, Bjorling sounds very immediate (i.e. close to the microphone), but Nilsson sounds quite distant.  That is because on the original recording Bjorling was on the left and Nilsson on the right, the latter continuously on the right from the beginning of \"In questa reggia\" until the second riddle, by which time she has come more or less to center.  Since a very distinct stereophonic separation of singers and sections of the orchestra occurs throughout this recording, to present either one channel or the other only is a miscalculation; even the trombones of the orchestra are much more in the left channel than in the right, whereas the string basses are much more in the right, to give only two examples.  This version is thus presenting only \"half\" of the original recording in a sense, and the buyer who has even a nominal interest in this opera would do far better to pay a higher price for both channels of the stereo recording rather than only one.  Amazon offers both the original cd issue and the SACD hybrid, both of which I have, and the latter is far superior in its frequency range, the former suffering from a lack of bass response which was not the case even on the original LPs.As far as the (full) stereo performance, it's a mixed bag, although it's still my favorite recording of this opera.  The orchestra is second-rate, and the chorus is third-rate, full of wobbly voices.  For example, in Act III this chorus slaughters the close harmonies and intricate voice-leadings of \"Ombra dolente, non farci del male\"; I remember thinking, when I first heard the John Alldis Choir sing this same passage on the 1972 Mehta recording, \"Oh, *that's* what Puccini wrote,\" confirmed by the piano-vocal and full scores of the opera that I bought c. 1980.  But the glories of this set (when both channels can be heard) is in the conducting of Erich Leinsdorf, and in an unequalled cast.  The conductor paces this opera more satisfactorily than any other in my experience, and Nilsson is definitive in this role, although she was admittedly in slightly better voice for the 1965 EMI recording.  That recording, however, is cut in Act II, and furthermore presents inferior singing, particularly with Ping and Timur, and is conducted with no more than efficiency by Francesco Molinari-Pradelli.  Here, however, Ping is taken by the underrated baritone Mario Sereni, with a fine voice and some of the clearest articulations of the words I've ever heard.  Add to that the glorious singing and interpretation of Jussi Bjorling (here recorded, at least when *both* channels are presented) better than usual, and the fine performance of the Italian-American bass Giorgio Tozzi, whom I had the good fortune to meet, briefly, once (as in, he signed my program and otherwise there was no conversation between us) and we have here a \"clincher,\" in my opinion.  An added plus is Renata Tebaldi as Lui, sounding generally better here than in her 1955 recording of the same role for Decca, though that recording (which I've also had since before 1980) is definitely worth a listen.But please, do justice to these artists, to the producer and recording engineer, and to defunct RCA (now swallowed by BMG and Sony) and purchase at least a stereophonic version of this recording, even if it costs 10x more than this one-channel issue, the reasoning of which I'm at a total loss to explain, other than cheapness.\n", "val": 7.443496724590659e-05}
{"text": "But worth $3 I imagine. The sound is like it's recorded in a tunnel with the microphones at a distance from singers, chorus and orchestra. I believe Stockowski got better sound in the 1930's for his recording of Schoenberg's Gurrelieder, try a sample. Jussi Bjoerling sings quite well although sometimes the sound makes him sound as though his cheeks have too much rouge and he's definitely wearing lipstick. When Jussi and Birgitt have their first confrontation she is WAY in the back somewhere singing marvelously and he seems to have stolen the microphone for this duet, he is so much louder and in front. Having rarely heard Tebaldi sing I was definitely curious and she is quite wonderful although Caballe is better by a few hairs and Leona Mitchell in the dvd with Domingo also. Can't remember if I've heard Scotto as Liu but then, there's that devastating recording Leontyne Price made on her debut album. Good luck Lius. Jussi does his two big arias, Non Piangere Liu and Nessun Dorma quite well but I think I'll dub Pavarotti unsurpassed in this role although everyone else has done a marvelous job, never mind Domingo's little crack on that high note in the dvd. If the sound were better the chorus might not sound like an octet but it does when you can hear it. Although the cover art is different I assume this is the classic recording from the 1950's that once sported a dragon on the cover. Leinsdorf never really had a following. No one apparently thought he was the greatest conductor that ever lived but he always did excellent work as far as I know and certainly made a lot of recordings. For those who like to critique conductors, he's a good target. I've been listening to the recording with Sutherland and Pavarotti every other day for I don't know how long. A year? Nothing like an iPod to enhance obsession and really clarify music. It is so much more present when it is in your head. With sound like this you can't fairly compare Nillson and Sutherland but I believe the two are, dare I say, equally good? Dame Joan and Luciano rule.\n", "val": 0.011359106749296188}

{"text": "When it has came down to Motown lately, many people have rediscovered the classic R&B rhythms last year with the celebration of Motown's 50th Anniversary. But, with all the celebrating, there was also tragedy with the heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, and how much that placed a dark cloud over Motown, and the legacy of so many delightful artists of the 60's and 70's era of great R&B. That also has been said with The Commodores as well. It has been nearly 40 years since they've performed their first times together in the heart of Alabama. Since then, Lionel Richie and company have made one of the strongest impacts in pop music. Nevertheless, with all the talks of them reuniting within the past few years, that unfortunately never saw the light of day. Well, for those of us whom still want to enjoy a loving sense of what The Commodores were all about, it is right here,The 2009 Commodores Definitive Collection, is a great retrospective of why they've been one of the most influential groups in Pop, R&B, and Funk you could even imagine in the 70's and early 80's. The collection of songs have all been remastered well, and include their biggest songs. While the collection is honestly nothing new for hard core Commodores fans, if you've purchased their 1997 Ultimate Collection, the track lising is honestly the exact same listing of songs. Nevertheless, they still sound absolutely strong including classics from the heartwarming Easy, the funky Brick House, to lesser-recognized songs like Old-Fashion Love, all the way to their classics like Zoom, Just To Be Close To You, all the way to their last big hit, Nightshift, one of the few songs after Lionel left the group for his own solo success.While it is so sad that The Commodores aren't together anymore, it honestly is too easy to forget how great their songs honestly were. If you've alreasy bought their 1997 Ultimate Collection, stay with that because it is the exact same collection. But, for anyone whom never experienced what it is like to hear a brick house of soul, than this would honestly be a great place to start, and that is purely easy like Sunday morning.Album Cover: B+Songs: B+Price: B+Remastering: A-Overall: B+\n", "val": 0.014698177576065063}

{"text": "Please note that this review refers to the older, non-commercial promotional CD, which has the ITC promotional painting on the cover and does NOT reflect the Silva Screen Release. I mention this because somehow this review has also been attached to the page advertising the commercial release, and the information contained does not reflect the contents of the Silva disc. I have written a separate review that accurately describes the quality of the Silva Screen disc.The second year of the series \"Space:1999\" was it's last, and to the chagrin of many of it's fans, it did not get a commercial soundtrack album release. Due to the lack of a proper soundtrack, this CD was a much sought after collectible during the lean years before the resurgence of commercial interest in \"Space:1999\".The disc was produced in the early '90s by a staff member of 'Starlog Magazine', using copies of monophonic mixdown tapes from the personal collection of series composer Derek Wadsworth. A limited ( but presumably large ) number of original copies were produced. Most of these were given to Wadsworth for his personal use, and some were kept by the staffer who produced them.Although labeled \"For Promotional Use Only\", several original copies made their way into the hands of fans and collectors, and with the proliferation of home disc duplicating technology during the mid 1990's, seemingly hundreds of bootleg copies suddenly became available at conventions, and on internet outlets like Ebay. Many of these copies were of dubious quality, and due to the limitations of home duping technology at the time, some would have tracks missing.An original CD is easily identified by the image of the \"Space:1999\" logo, and the series ubiquitous 'Eagle' spacecraft, over an image of the moon printed directly on the disc. Most copies that I've seen, if they sport any artwork at all, have computer printed adhesive labels with varying images on them. So, caveat emptor!As to the sound quality, the disc was well produced from mono tapes, so the mixes sound very close to the way they did on television - but with better fidelity. The tracks sound as though they run a tiny bit slower than the originals, and there are occasional defects from tape damage such as flutter, drag, and during one track an increase in volume, that remains until the end of the disc. The tracks are not all presented in the order that they appeared in the various episodes, and there are no tracks from the one other full score that Wadsworth wrote for the series; \"The Taybor\". However, despite it's minor deficiencies it's still a nice listen. This disc does have one track not found on any other release; a slightly different mix of the second unused alternate theme ( listed as \"Alternate Theme Three\" on the artwork ), but it's hardly worth paying an exorbitant price.This CD was rendered somewhat obsolete by the release of a much more complete, fully remastered two disc set produced from the original stereo master tapes by Fanderson. But that set -now out of print- was available for sale to club members only ( although you can still find copies for sale at high prices on the internet ). Silva Screen will be releasing a pared down single disc of the stereo soundtrack in October of 2009. However, an original copy of this CD is still a nice, and somewhat rare collectable for the hardcore \"1999\" fan.\n", "val": 3.184061642969027e-05}

{"text": "This is a fabulous album. I'm really blown away by Allen Stone. I caught a few seconds of his voice when he performed his song Unaware on Conan. I watch Conan with my mom every night it's on and almost never check out the musical guest, mostly because she would want to watch the whole performance even if she didn't like what she was hearing. I think I may have thought he was a comedian instead of a musical guest and that was why I checked it out to begin with. I figured I'd have a brief listen anyway and was surprised by what I heard, so I planned on listening to the rest of the performance later on. I listened to that performance of that song almost incessantly after I remembered to check it out a few days later. I never thought any song would top that live version of Unaware, but Allen proved me wrong. This man can sing. He can write a mean song, too. I found that out when I decided to check out more songs from him and delved deeper into it. I downloaded his Take One session and eventually decided I had to have this album, Last To Speak, as well as his self-titled album. I really love False Alarms, Figure It Out and Quit Callin. Breathe Anymore is so sad but it's a great song. I loved Reality, too--especially the beautiful lyrics in the chorus. I love them all. The title-track Last To Speak is such a powerful song lyrically.

{"text": "Not content to recreate the sonic landscape of their (in my opinion) breakout album, Lust Lust Lust, the Raves have pushed a little harder this time, focusing on the songwriting aspect of putting together an album and putting less time into the noise. Where Lust played like one extended mood, where songs were discernible only in that there was a pause between tracks and maybe a subtle shift in style, In and Out of Control plays much more so as a collection of songs. And songs these are, showing the band's love of '50s girl groups and Phil Spector while still maintaining that signature Raveonettes via the Jesus and Mary Chain sound. Unfortunately, the added focus on songwriting is a mixed bag, as not every song idea turns out to be a real keeper, and I do sorely miss the artistic haze of Lust's swirling mass of distortion. Regardless, there are some killer tracks here, with my particular favorites being \"Last Dance\" and \"Suicide,\" which not-so-coincidentally sound the most like their last album. They're fabulous slow-tempo rockers, and they have a healthy mix of song structure and gauzy musical goodness. Definitely a record aimed at bringing in some new fans, and certainly more accessible than Lust Lust Lust.\n", "val": 0.007077690679579973}
{"text": "The opener \"Bang!\" is reminiscent of a \"Go-Go Girls\" song that doesn't cover any new or interesting ground.  But of course if you are into that and the jubliant side of The Raveonettes, or are simply more open to it, then you'll like it.  I found it out of place on the album, and hope it somehow doesn't become a popular American shopping mall music mix inclusion at the Disney Store.But beyond that, the dark lyrics about the reality of every day life are still there, but without the exhilerating fuzz and dynamic distorted crescendos and trance-like seques of \"Lust Lust Lust.\"\"In And Out Of Control\" will appeal to a wider audience, and maintains their sensibilities and style, along with an evolution, if not expansion in sound and style, that keeps fans intact while attracting new ones.Personal highlights are \"Gone Forever,\" \"Breaking Into Cars,\" \"Break Up Girls!\" and \"Heart Of Stone.\"  All four tracks are single release quality that are very comparable to their classics from the first two records (Attack Of The Ghost Riders, Beat City, That Great Love Sound etc..,).\"Last Dance\" is along the lines of the track \"Bang!\" and is just a bit too frolicky and cheery for me in general, but very listenable.  \"D.R.U.G.S.,\" and \"Suicide\" are two other top notch Raveonettes classic songs, that really show off their ability to create rockin', upbeat music without spilling over into the cheese bucket, but draw from their punk rockabilly and 80's goth influences.Finally, see these guys live, they are fantastic, play the majority of this album, and still manage to include most of their previously expected tunes as well, and do it very well with a ton of atmosphere and energy.  A completely underrated band throughout this decade.\n", "val": 0.02097161114215851}

{"text": "With track titles like \"Gone Forever,\" \"Suicide\" and \"Oh, I Buried You Today,\" fans of the Raveonettes could be forgiven for thinking the Danish duo of Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo had a bad year after the release of 2008's Lust Lust Lust. It only takes about forty-five seconds into opener \"Bang\" for those concerns to vanish, however, about when Foo's pixie-ish vocals declare \"kids wanna bop, out in the street / fa-fa-fun all summer long\" as the power chords reach sugar overload. Of course, the palpable sense of excitement and happiness is obvious from the beginning, as \"Bang\" is perhaps the Raveonettes most refined, direct stab at blissfully optimistic pop ever. It's absurdly catchy and the feelings of joy it sends out are practically impossible to ignore, vibes that set the tone for the record to follow.Lust Lust Lust was an interesting record, one that showcased the Raveonettes' undeniable ear for a pop hook but tended to suffocate them in waves of the fuzz and distortion the band is known for. In and Out of Control, on the other hand, allows the couple's golden ears to shine through - from \"Bang\" to closer \"Wine,\" it's an unvarnished look at what the Raveonettes do best. They've always taken inspiration from the great power pop groups of the past, from the Go-Go's to Blondie to Buddy Holly, as their cover of \"My Boyfriend's Back\" proudly acknowledged, but with a heavy dose of modern distortion medicine reminiscent of the Jesus and Mary Chain or the Velvet Underground, and In and Out of Control strikes that balance perfectly.They wear their influences on the sleeve, certainly, but at the same time never allow their own voices to become overwhelmed. \"Last Dance\" mimics a `50s pop-rock torch song you might have heard at your prom, if you were a baby boomer and the house band had somehow gotten their hands on a dozen different distortion pedals. \"Heart of Stone\" is coated in so much reverb and bouncy echoes that it sounds as if it was recorded through a time warp, but the band wisely allows the song's signature riff to shine through and the gorgeous melody to remain on top of all the mess.  And \"Boys Who Rape (Should All Be Destroyed)\" will probably be the most straightforward public service announcement you'll hear all year, not to mention one of the best songs. Cleverly masking some of the most scathing lyrics on the record (side note: In and Out of Control is easily one of the most unlikely records to deserve a Parental Advisory sticker; check out some of these lyrics!) with a charmingly spritely performance by Foo and the kind of infectious chorus that makes the title seem like a love anthem. Wagner's flawless solo near the end sounds like it was recorded in 1968 and puts just the right touch on a song that defines split personality.The momentum is sadly stunted, however, with the out-of-place ambient ballad \"Oh, I Buried You Today,\" which meanders around Foo's ethereal vocals but never really goes anywhere. Marking the middle of the record, it only emphasizes the album's top-heaviness, In and Out of Control's most glaring issue. First single \"Suicide\" is a highlight, a four-on-the-floor chorus and sparkling guitar work understating perhaps the album's thesis: \"get your foot in this trashy world / empty-hearted bus by your side / lick your lips and f**k suicide.\" From there to the soothing comedown of \"Wine,\" it's a series of songs that are either melodically uninteresting (\"D.R.U.G.S.,\" \"Breaking Into Cars\") or out-of-place filler seemingly included only for the sake of reminding us that, yes, the Raveonettes are still noise rock (\"Break Up Girls!\").Then again, perhaps the second half of the record disappoints because the quality of the first is so high. The Raveonettes have never been wildly popular even among the indie scene, and it's possible it was due to their earlier inability to decide whether they wanted to be a noise band or a pop duo. But with In and Out of Control, they prove they can have it both ways, making decidedly modern music with a songwriting heart aligned firmly with their retro predecessors. And with three-minute gems like \"Bang\" and \"Suicide,\" the Raveonettes have their best shot in years at breaking through.\n", "val": 0.015465689823031425}
{"text": "I have to admit I am one of the few people who actually enjoyed Pretty in Black. It wasn't as good as the band's other albums but it was pleasant. I wasn't so thrilled with their previous album Lust, Lust, Lust. The music just bored me. After such mediocre music, I wasn't sure whether I wanted the new Raveonettes' album In and Out of Control but after hearing their song \"Last Dance\" on my local modern rock station, I decided to get it. I am glad I did. In and Out of Control quickly reminded me what made me fall in love with The Raveonettes' music. Most of the songs got stuck in my head like \"Bang!\" and \"Last Dance\" with their charming '60s retro pop melodies. Lyrically? I think the band could have done better. I absolutely hate \"Boys Who Rape (Should All Be Destroyed)\". I thought the lyrics were pretty terrible. I also did not care for \"D.R.U.G.S\". I also thought some of the melodies on the album felt flat like on the two aforementioned tracks but overall In and Out of Control is a million times better than the duo's previous two albums.

Those three minutes aside, the album gets back on track with \"Heart of Stone\"  and the tender \"Oh, I Buried You Today.\" \"Breaking Into Cars\" is a standout track.  \"Break Up Girls!\" seems to imagine a lost, distorted B-side to \"Leader of the Pack.\"  The album closes with the atmospheric and maudlin \"Wine,\" lamenting \"Lone/roads/sprinkled/with tears\" and a summer that \"threw our love away.\"\n", "val": 0.012867135927081108}

I can't think of any record that's come out this year that I've played so much (not that this alone makes it record of the year or anything. Like I said in my review of \"Lust Lust Lust\", these guys don't do anything new. They just mix classic sounds very tastefully. And they are incredible live!).My favorite songs:Bang - has a serious Ramones / playing in the street (in Brownsville in the 60s?) with the fire hydrant running vibeLast Dance - best freakin' Raveonettes chorus ever, great lyrics, great melodiesHeart of Stone - really great, simple guitar riffSuicide - again, such a great chorus. I can't get their choruses out my head these days.Breaking Into Cars - like a mix of the movie \"Warriors\" and Roxette on bathtub methh? so good.The two songs where they seem to mix up their style a bit (Boys Who Rape & Drugs) are actually the weakest songs to me. Maybe they haven't grown on me enough.Bottom line: if you're a repeat customer, you will be beyond stoked.

I simply love this band and their sound and I hear simalarities to The Jesus and Mary Chain and The Ramones. If you like those bands I would give this record a chance.

In Denmark he's fairly well-known and succesful, even though his own overly-poppy \"music\" is lousy, too. WHY would Sune Rose Wagner choose him as producer?The title In & Out Of Control makes perfect sense. The only really good tracks on this release are Gone Forever, Heart Of Stone, and Breaking Into Cars. Contrary to other reviewers here, I think Boys Who Rape (Should All Be Destroyed) is prettydecent.The remaining songs - BANG!!!I loved Pretty In Black and Lust, Lust, Lust, but this?

{"text": "The Raveonettes, consisting of Danish duo Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo, blazed onto the scene with their boisterous, shredding 2002 debut \"Whip It On\", shortly thereafter followed by the equally mesmorizing 2003 album \"The Chain Gang of Love\". Things after that took a decidedly turn for the worse with the baffling 2005 \"Pretty in Black\" album. The band took a long time to regroup after that disaster, and returned in 2008 with the ok-but-not-great \"Lust Lust Lust\" album. Now comes the band's 5th album.\"In and Out of Control\" (11 tracks; 37 min.) in essence continues the path from \"Lust Lust Lust\", providing us with more of a mix between beautiful pop hooks and electric noise thrown in just to keep things interesting. Check out \"Gone Forever\" which starts off with a minute of so of dead noise only to then dive in with a great pop song, as if the first minute didn't happen. \"Last Dance\" (1st single) is a great song. The second half of the album is actually the more interesting one for me, with such nuggets as \"Bearking Into Cars\" and best of all, the hard-charging \"Break Up Girls!\", reminding me of their earliest and most exciting output. At 37 min, this all makes for a quick listen. Overall, in the Raveonettes universe, this feels like a 'safe' album. (Of course, compared to the mainstream music out there, this remains cutting-edge.)The album I bought came with a bonus EP consisting of 2 tracks (6 min.), containing the upbeat \"The Chosen One\", which would have been a nice addition to the album proper, and \"Planes Do Crash\", an unremarkable tune. I've seen the Ravonettes in concert a number of times over the years, and they always shine live, better than their studio output. They'll be coming to Cincinnati in a few weeks in support of the new album, and you bet I will be there. Finally, if you wonder where you can hear this band, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none.\n", "val": 0.010729308240115643}

The arrangements are perfect and some have a jazzy, Joni Mitchell feel to them that works very well. 1 John 4;16 (?) and Matthew 21;24 (tracks 8 and 9) are some of the most sublimely beautiful songs that Darnielle has ever written. Who else could write such a beautiful song about watching someone you love die as the Matthew 21;24 song proves.

{"text": "For any and all fans of the Mountain Goats,After listening to this album all morning, I can honestly say that this has quickly become one of my favorite tMG's albums.  I do not think I enjoy is more than \"We Shall Be Healed\" or \"All Hail West Texas\", but it has already surpassed \"Get Lonely\" and \"Heretic Pride\", both albums that I love.  As for its place with \"Tallahassee\" and \"The Sunset Tree\", I just think that I cannot decide yet.The album opens slowly, not quite as understated as \"Wild Sage\" is for an album opener, but still soft and cool.  Then we move quickly into \"Psalms\" which hits nicely, heavier, and still with the lyrics of John Darnielle which always echo towards a quite desperation, an overall voice of hope in a time of confusion and let-down.  The album continues this pattern of softer songs, some solo type works with just John and the piano or guitar, and a few full band rockers, but nothing nearly as hard-hitting as \"Lovecraft in Brooklyn\" or anything along those lines.High Points for me:\"1 John 4:16\" is simply amazing.  This songs sang directly to me.  I could not think of anything except past loves and desires, not to mention trying to look forward in these scary times of stress and loss.  Whenever John sings \"I know that you thinking of me because it's just about to rain\" I almost break down.  I have now listen to the track at least six times and cannot get over it.Low Point:So if you buy from here, you get a bonus track, but also check on the apple site because they have a different bonus track that you can download as a single.  I recommend spending the buck on that, but it is a low point because I hate to give apple my money at all and I hate when the record companies release songs like this, forcing you to go to a certain company that you may not like when all you want to do is listen to someone that you like.Also, as for the album, I can see someone finding it a bit boring.  It reminds me in a way of \"Get Lonely\" in that sense.  It is slow and understating, which may turn some people away.  Give it a chance and listen to it a few times.  It might take a few passes to really start catching those John Darnielle lines.  I know every fan of tMGs has certain lines that speak to them, so give it a shot, but as for a pop album, it can be kind of slow and lacking in dynamics.To sum up everything here: This is a 5 star album, no doubt about it, but is it for everyone?  No.  This is not an album that just anyone will enjoy, but that is the same for all of the albums from The Mountain Goats.  Also, give it a few passes before you place judgment.  If you are a fan of the lo-fi folk style, you are not going to get any of that.  If you are a fan of the \"Get Lonely\"/\"The Sunset Tree\" style, then I think you will enjoy this one for sure.  With all of the piano work on this album (by far the most of any album so far by John), a lot of the songs are in the style of the tracks from \"Satanic Messiah\" and \"Black Pear Tree\".I hope I covered the album well enough for everyone here.  I know if you are new to tMGs, then all of these references will go right over you, but if you like what you have heard so far, trust me, you will soon know all of these songs and albums very well.  This is just another stellar piece of artwork in a long string of brilliant albums.  Get it!\n", "val": 0.0012270350707694888}
{"text": "Another year, another Mountain Goats album. The constantly metamorphosing folk project of singer/songwriter John Darnielle, The Life of the World to Come is their 17th album in 18 years, an impressive number for any band, much less one man. Coming a little over a year and a half after 2008's excellent Heretic Pride, Life features Darnielle turning to that massive old tome which has fascinated and ensnared many a bard before him: the Bible. A concept album of sort, each title in this twelve-song set is named after a particular verse relating, in one way or another, to the intensely personal, highly literate tales that have become the Mountain Goats' hallmark.But lest you think Darnielle has become Christian rock's newest poet, consider that the Mountain Goats have always worked their best magic under practically hymnal conditions, intertwining Darnielle's heartbreakingly honest, slice-of-life lyrics and colorful metaphors with subtle instrumentation and mellow folk. Taking up where 2005's Get Lonely left off and eschewing the fleshed-out (for the Goats, anyways) production of Heretic Pride, this latest nails just what makes the Mountain Goats such a long-lived project in a world that really doesn't reward intelligent, thoughtful songwriting. From the somber strumming of opener \"1 Samuel 15:23\" to the soft boil of dark closer \"Ezekiel 7 and the Permanent Efficacy of Grace,\" Darnielle uses the templates of these passages to reflect on his own life experiences, to meditate on the struggles and triumphs that mankind goes through every day and, in doing so, creates an album that strikes right at the core of the human condition.This may sound unbearably pompous to strangers of Darnielle's work, but it's his straightforward way of doing things and imitable way with words that immediately disarm. After you've heard his fragile voice crack without any sense of self-consciousness on the frantic build-up of \"Psalms 40:2\" or heard his tragic recollection of a loved one's cancer and death on the poignant \"Matthew 25:21,\" it becomes obvious that Darnielle remains one of (if not the) best songwriters of his generation. The understated production here serves only to reinforce the strength of the words at the forefront, as the Life of the World to Come is almost brazen in its stylistic singularity, maintaining the same basic mix throughout of acoustic guitar, a heavy dose of piano, and some string and orchestra flourishes courtesy of Final Fantasy's Owen Pallett. This leaves Darnielle and his wavering, all-too-imperfect vocals to sink or swim on their own. And whether he's singing an earnest tale of love on \"Genesis 30:3\" or narrating the thoughts of a lonely prisoner in \"1 John 4:16,\" Darnielle is more than capable of keeping himself afloat.To be fair, the Mountain Goats shtick does get tired over the course of the album, particularly the sobering stretch of tunes that begins with the aforementioned \"1 John 4:16\" and continues through \"Deuteronomy 2:10.\" The similar feel of the down tempo tunes tends to blend into one each other, making it unfortunately difficult to tell the songs apart from each other, at least musically. Nor is Darnielle committed to creating a record that will appeal to the casual listener; The Life of the World to Come is an album in the truest sense, with perhaps only \"Genesis 3:23\" and \"Philippians 3:20-21,\" with their comparatively lively pop structures, making a case for single-worthy status.Nevertheless, what Darnielle does best is write songs that can resonate with anybody, no matter their musical disposition, and in that respect Life is a tremendous success. With some of his most naked writing in years focused by the narrative framework of the Bible and a return to the sparse accompaniment that characterized their earlier works, Darnielle and company have again created a strong contender for folk record of the year.\n", "val": 0.004974843468517065}

If Steve Reich, Brian Eno (\"Another Green World\") and Primal Scream (\"Xtrmntr\") had a love child, this record would be it.

But if you are open to the sonic possibilities of modern music, this is one mind-blowing record.  FB manages to make music that is mind-pulverizing, fantastically energizing and cerebral all at the same time, a pretty impressive trick.  What they do best is layer sound and rhythms and counter-rhythms together, and then keep adding more and more layers until the songs build into something of staggering proportion.  Yet order somehow comes out of chaos.  \"Olympians\" is the best track, which builds into an organ chord progression (all of this probably comes out of a synthesizer) that is nothing short of majestic.  The organ then recedes and gives way to a series of high synthesizer tones that is, yes, wonderfully melodic.  \"Lisbon Maru\" isn't far behind, with its devastating fuzz-bass-like riffs and marching-band-on-speed drumming.  My only complaint is with the last track, \"Phantom Limbs,\" which is marred by cheesy grade-B sci fi movie sound effects.If FB can build on the best ideas here, they could come up with some amazing stuff.  To me, this is the best record of 2009, edging out other great indie records by Animal Collective, Antlers, Grizzly Bear, etc.  If you're open to a little adventure and aren't afraid of a little sonic chaos, you should check this out.

Band like Firefight got my attention first. I didn't have to pay for this track. I'm kind of glad I didn't, all too common its just a song that doesn't stand out.

{"text": "When we purchased this CD originally a few years ago, it was with some trepidation. We had only heard one song from David Crowder Band at the time, but we have not once regretted getting that CD! Not only do my husband and I love the music, at the time we purchased the CD our son had just been born. He is one of those people who simply do not \"suffer in silence\" and he hated riding in the car. After a week or so of a screaming newborn every time we tried to ride somewhere in the car, my husband tried turning on the \"Church Music\" CD. It was like magic! Both our sons love it, and the baby never had another bad ride again - until the CD was so used it started skipping. So we purchased this CD to replace the one we have worn out. WE LOVE IT!!!!\n", "val": 0.00314437597990036}

I was constantly wanting to put something else in. It's very incoherent, hard to find hooks, and hard to be entertained by. It's like a computer going on the blink.

I'm more of a fan of the previous hard-charging rock and praise that DCB is so well known for.That said, this experimental album is an interesting one, and non-Christians may listen to it without complaining too much on a drive in the car, so it is useful in that way.\n", "val": 0.008499541319906712}

When I bought this, I was looking for hymns and thought it would be interesting to hear the DCB sing the old fashioned hymns.  But these are not hymns.  I like these better!  These songs draw me into the heart of Father God.  \"How He Loves Us\" is sung differently than I'm used to but that doesn't detract from the overall quality of this album.\n", "val": 0.021872058510780334}
{"text": "There are few groups out there that can match the sheer uniqueness of David Crowder Band. Though I haven't listened to much of their work aside from their most recent release, Church Music, it is evident even on that one project that these guys refuse to conform to any mold the music industry makes so many others fit into. The songs on Church Music often ride the border between strange and awesome with finesse and excellence, and when that quality is coupled with the album's extensive track listing and seamless cohesiveness, it's possibly one of the finest records by a Christian artist you could possibly find.First off, I think there is one fact that needs to be made clear: Church Music isn't really \"church music;\" that is, not in the sense that these are songs you would sing in church, but that's simply because they don't fit a congregational style in any way, shape, or form. However, that's part of the reason the album is so great. Lyrically it is worshipful at the core, often reflecting on various aspects of God's presence and the love and joy He gives, so in that sense it is indeed \"church music,\" if you want to call it music for God's people, but musically it doesn't fit the mold at all.That said, Church Music features songs that range from rock to dance to everything in between. Yes, I said dance. Just listen to the title track, which is aptly subtitled, \"Dance (!).\" That song in particular is the most obvious representation of the dance side of the record, while songs like \"God Almighty, None Compares\" feature the all-out rock side of the album with blazing guitar solos and a pounding chorus. There are also some brilliant hybrids of rock and dance on Church Music, especially \"The Veil\" and \"What a Miracle.\" Sometimes it's less about the actual sound of dance and more about the rhythms that define the genre, which is especially obvious in \"The Nearness\" and \"Eastern Hymn,\" which are more like rockers with catchy, almost danceable beats. Of course Church Music isn't without its quieter moments, as evidenced in the moving \"SMS (Shine)\" and the phenomenal, back-to-back covers of Flyleaf's \"All Around Me\" and John Mark McMillan's \"How He Loves.\" When it's all said and done, Church Music offers a diverse and often unusual array of musical treats, which makes it an immense pleasure to listen to from start to finish.David Crowder's lyrics on Church Music are consistently worshipful and well-phrased: a feature that also contributes immensely to the record's quality. Much of the record focuses on God's presence among us and the proper sense of awe that should come with it, especially with songs like \"The Nearness,\" \"Eastern Hymn,\" and \"All Around Me.\" Other aspects of being with God are also evident, such as the dividing wall being torn down by Christ (\"The Veil\"), taking refuge in Him (\"Can I Lie Here,\" \"Birmingham (We Are Safe)\"), and the pure worship and rejoicing that comes with being in His presence (\"Oh, Happiness,\" \"God Almighty, None Compares,\" \"Church Music - Dance (!)\").Two other qualities also contribute immensely to the success of Church Music as a whole. First off, the album's running time clocks in at 1 hour and 14 minutes and spans a whopping 17 tracks, which, in terms of quality, range anywhere from great to amazing. It's a staggering amount of music for a single album, and while that makes it hard to listen to in one sitting, you can hardly count that against it when there's just so much excellent music to go around. Also, the album plays through its entire running time seamlessly by adding flawless transitions between each song, making the album feel amazingly cohesive despite all of the diverse musical styles that appear throughout the record.If you aren't convinced to get David Crowder Band's masterpiece Church Music by now, I really don't know what will sway you. You'll certainly have a hard time finding anything significantly better, seeing as there are few albums out there that are as long, diverse, and cohesive all at the same time, while still being composed of songs that work just as well alone as they do together. So to get to the point of this review, you really should get Church Music, because it's excellent, entertaining, and there's really nothing quite like it.\n", "val": 0.022473247721791267}

I just cannot wrap my mind around David Crowder with a disco drum beat and techno-noise with tons of keyboard sounds in the background.

{"text": "With their newest release, David Crowder Band solidifies itself as not only one of the most consistent and gifted writers of worship music, but the primary driving force of the genre. Combining a wide range of instrumentation, with consistently poetic and meaningful lyrics, this is an album that simply cannot be missed.Perhaps one of the most interesting things about it is the progression, and what I believe Crowder is trying to say with it. The album is called 'Church Music', which is interesting because at first glance, this is not the type of music we're used to hearing in churches. But at the same time, this IS church music- what it has been, what it is, and what it will be.The CD starts off with 'Phos Hilaron (Hail Gladenning Light) is the earliest known Christian Hymn, originally written in Greek and by the Byzantines and dated back to the 3rd century, Crowder's version is distinctive and brilliant, yet keeps the same timeless ideas from the original song. This starts the CD, and gives a new spin on a long established foundation. Then we're brought into 'Alleluia, Sing', a nice song, but one that is all together familiar or typical by contemporary standards, something not unlike a Chris Tomlin or Hillsong United song. From there, we get some Crowderesque songs with popping synth and electronica in 'The Nearness', 'Eastern Hymn', 'The Veil', and 'We Are Loved'. This is balanced out by a couple fantastic worshipful ballads in 'Shadows' and 'SMS (Shine)'.One of the CDs highlights is the middle- two covers of Flyleaf's 'All Around Me' and John Mark McMillan's 'How He Loves Us'. The first should be noted for how different it is from its original source, yet beautiful and how well it works. The second is a song sweeping through the church like a holy fire, a wonderful beautiful string of metaphors outlining God's love for us.From there, the CD makes a turn. DCB is perhaps at its best when they are experimenting and pushing the envelope, and that's exactly what they're doing here. Each one of these songs deserves mention, from 'God Almighty None Compares' dualing guitar solos, to 'Oh Happiness' whimsical uplifting chorus, and 'Church Music- Dance!'s catchy techno like beats. The album ends with 'In the End (Oh Respledent Light)' which wraps things up perfectly. Like a closing paragraph to a well thought thesis, it reiterates previous ideas with lines like 'In his arms there is rest, in the shadow there is peace' before bringing back the melody line of the first song. It bookends things perfectly.More than anything, Church Music is one continuous, beautiful, interesting, and well thought out worship service that David Crowder Band brings straight to you. It is over 70 minutes of some of the best music money can buy, and a wonderful experience of encountering God all in one.\n", "val": 0.021344834938645363}

{"text": "David Crowder is a musical genius. Here are three reasons why:1) He and his band have crafted an album which that beautifully transitions from one song to another for 17 songs totaling 73 minutes. The last song also loops back around and is a transition to the first song. Sure other bands have accomplished similar feats, but it is not easy to do, especially to the brilliance that Crowder does it. As a song winds down, you can feel the tempo change and in sets up a certain anticipation for the next song.2) The album is a history of church music. The album opens up with \"Phos Hilaron\", which is the oldest hymn in existence that is still being used today that isn't from the Bible. I don't know the specifics of each song, but I know the Eastern Hymn is from the Middle Ages when the Pope banned the tri-tone. In The End  is obviously about the end of times when there is no suffering or hurting and we are in God's hands.3) This entire album is a complete irony. You would not classify any of these songs as traditional worship songs (church music). In fact this whole album is electronically influenced. While the lyrics are obviously worshiping God, the instrumentation says otherwise. From the club vibe of \"The Veil\", to the 70's disco sound of \"Church Music - Dance!\", to the bips and bleeps found throughout the record that sounds like something off a NES game. The epic guitar work on \"God Almighty\". These are elements not found in a hymn, or even contemporary worship for that matter.Each song is beautifully crafted and it is obvious that a tremendous amount of time and thought went into both writing and recording. The lyrics are deep and inspiring and there are plenty of different types of instrumentations to keep things fun and intersting. Each song stands on its own, but the album can only truly be fully experienced when listened to all the way through.

The beats and mixes are wonderfully unpredictable and in full range, reminiscent in style from Roger and Zapp, Mr. Mister, Depeche Mode, rock, metal-ish, techno, with ballads, but they are still quite unique, and they all work, well.The lyrics are abstract at times, but I find them all terribly sincere, as how can anyone truly objectify or articulate Who GOD is, how wonderful He is, His beauty...More than the beats and mixes, much more, is the fact that when I hear this DC*B CD, I am put into a mindset focusing on the majesty and glory of Christ, His beauty, compassion, and love.  I find myself, even while driving, just wanting to fall on my face and worship in adoration, awe and gratitude.Powerful.  DC*B reminds me that music unlike traditional \"church music\" can still lead/help us to enter in to \"that place\" of worship.When I hear music like this, it makes me think that the artist(s) has truly been spending time with the Lord, themselves, worshiping, in His presence.Well done, DC*B.

This CD is the best yet to accomplish this goal.  I would not have an qualms of giving this CD to a person that does not know the Lord, and knowing that they would enjoy the musicality of it...and pray that they will have questions to ask me regarding why we love the Lord so much...because it is evident in every lyric that is sung on this CD.Lastly, I normally like to put my CDs on random because I get tired for anticipating the next song and usually end up falling asleep if I don't randomize the songs.  Not so with this CD.  Each song flows so well into the next, I feel that I miss out if I randomize.

{"text": "Wow, Wow, Wow is all you can say after test driving this CD the first few times.  My personal fav leading up to this one was \"Illuminate,\" but \"Church Music\" just blows it away.  This guy is unreal in what he can write and what he can do in the studio.  This CD is the product of what can occur when you combine masterful songwriting, a high energy we are going full throttle worship band and an Alan Parsons-Phil Spector caliber production.  There is a rapid pulse that runs through the entire length of this collection of songs.  There are turbo charged praise songs: Alleluia Sing, SMS [Shine] and Shadows.  There are techno-pop influenced songs like Eastern Hymn, The Veil and Birmingham [We Are Safe].  There are somewhat darker, foreboding ballads like We Are Loved and All Around Me.  There is also what could be described as nothing other as dance-funk-groove with the title track.  Then there is the apocalyptic sounding God Almighty, Non Compares.  But arguably my favorite track is the techno-upbeat Oh Happiness which still rings classic Crowder.  There is no filler and nothing but hard driving electronic inspired Crowder-esque energetic praise music on these 17 tracks.  And a very special added bonus here is the John Mark McMillan cover \"How He Loves.\"  Crowder handles this one magically and outdoes the original like only he can.  The guitar flavoring, electronic percussion and accompaniment on the CD is top notch.  \"Church Music\" takes CCM to an entirely new level. A new bar has been set.  Mainstream will find David Crowder eventually,  and there will be no disappointment.\n", "val": 0.01533372700214386}

From the first song to the last song, each song just flows right after each other without any long pauses. You really need to hear the words David Crowder is singing about to appreciate the cd. There might be fans who might not like this cd, but let me tell you that if they kept on doing the same style they would never grow to who they are now.

The band wanted to write more music that can be played in church, which is why they made this album. It has a little darker sound but in a good way. Its not all light and bouncy like most of his other albums.If you are a fan of the DCB's past albums, I would definitely listen to this one before you make a purchase.\n", "val": 0.0018267526756972075}

U2's \"Achtung Baby\" was a close second. Then, on Sept. 24, 2009, I listened to DC*B's \"Church Music\" and knew right away that it was their best. \"How could they top 'A Collision'?\" I thought.Now, after several more listens (and, do yourself a favor -- listen to all tracks chronologically with some high-quality headphones), \"Hounds of Love\" has been replaced by this incredible masterpiece. The concept, lyrics, performance and production are perfect. This album is a must-have for any fan of music. Also, this 6-piece band is a must-see live. My favorite tracks are \"Alleluia, Sing,\" \"SMS (Shine),\" \"The Veil,\" \"We Are Loved,\" \"How He Loves,\" \"Can I Lie Here,\" \"Birmingham (We Are Safe),\" \"Church Music - Dance(!),\" \"Oh Happiness,\" and \"In The End (O Resplendent Light!).\" My 3-year-old son loves \"Church Music - Dance (!)\" which we call \"The Robot Song.\"DC*B's new CD was also recorded in their home studio, which happens to be a barn in Waco, Texas.

I would even go to say that I think it's their best so far (I have all albums minus \"remedy\"). I now think the music is actually genius. But more than the music, the lyrics are so powerful. These songs speak of the objective (his love, his strength, his promises, his coming back) and the subjective (our need for him, our yearning for him) truth. These lyrics are amazing, the music is exciting, overall, the album rocks. But overall, the lyrics are what got to me. I can identify with the yearning so much. Also, the lyrics have a way of depicting God's love in a new light, an amazing new light.It may be a different style than what you are used to, but I highly recommend anyone to give it a try with the lyrics in his/her hand.

Disco and the talk box come roaring back for one track on \"Dance\".  And Jack and Mark's metal roots shine through on \"God Almighty, None Compares\".  All this on the same album, and strung together so seamlessly that the last track even blends into the first with the CD set on repeat.  And I like them ALL!The whole album has the epic feel of \"A Collision\" without the extra in-between tracks.  And far from being too electronic, this album just builds on the electronic influences that have been there at least since the \"Illuminate\" album.  We are after all talking about a band with a violinist, and a frontman who never puts down his acoustic guitar, on an album recorded in a barn...And the live show?  I own the Remedy Club Tour DVD and I still was not prepared for this... Mark sawing on his guitar with a violin bow a la Jimmy Page, Bwack's robot drummer, the whole band decked out in their Sunday best, with the humor that they always bring to the stage, serious musicians who refuse to take themselves seriously.This album will speak to your soul and bring a tear to your eye.

Granted, every CD has actually changed quite a bit, which I think shows a lot of the bands creative ability, but this one was hard for me to like. Very electronic feel, which is harder for me to worship to personally. I think many people, probably especially musicians, can appreciate this, and will love it. But I love the \"a collison\" and \"can you hear us\" and \"illuminate\" David Crowder, this is different though. So I am totally not downplaying what might be good in other people's minds, but if you are thinking of the old DC, I would say listen to some samples first before just purchasing.

{"text": "The MessageWhen you read the title of the David Crowder*Band's album Church Music, your brain immediately confronts you with the question, \"What is Church music?\"  That's the concept of this album, a question about how to define the sounds that come out of the mouths of Christians.  Ready for the really brain-scrunching answer?  Church music is the words and sounds that result when we as humans, in all our fault-filled humanity glory, are able to address a limitless, holy God.  Crowder & Co. use this album to delve into a survey of the history of music within Christianity.  Where they wind up is at the intersection of our modern day culture, our humanity if you will, and our redeeming Christ, our savior.  It's an intersection where the order and familiarity that we strive for meet the infinite and incomprehensible.  At that point where there seems to be pure paradox, we find, as Crowder points out, the most irrational thing of all, grace.Church music explores these themes, in true DCB fashion, with smart but accessible lyrics.  While several of the songs have only one verse and chorus that is repeated several times, this simplistic style never becomes shallow or vacuous.  The words often flow deep with meaning, and even when they are overtly simple the earnest honesty in Crowder's singing elevates them.  Throughout the album there are expressions of joy at Christ's majesty and grace, as in \"Alleluia, Sing,\" \"SMS (Shine),\" and \"Oh Happiness.\"  There are acknowledgments of our depravity, the pain that comes with living in a fallen world, and need for the cross, as in \"The Nearness,\" \"Shadows,\" and \"In the End (Oh Resplendent Light).\"  Some songs even force the question of what is acceptable to sing in church, as in \"Eastern Hymn\" and \"Church Music - Dance [!].\"The MusicChurch Music is without a doubt the band's most cohesive album to date, due in large part to the electronic micro-interludes that make each song subtly flow into the next.  That being said, the entire album embraces this electronic, or \"pop\" as Crowder explains, theme.  Rather than adopting a techno-cheese brand of electronic music though, DCB gets its inspiration from chiptunes, circuit-bending, sampling, and the generally highly-produced efforts of today's pop music.  You can definitely tell that the wiz-kid programming abilities of drummer Bwack and the mixology genius of violinist/DJ/synth player Hogan came into major play on this album.  DCB have dabbled before with electronic parts in their songs (i.e.:  \"Here is Our King, Can You Feel It?, ...Neverending...\").  Here though they are fully committed that sound.  Thankfully, it suits not only the band but also Crowder's voice superbly.  If you don a pair of decent headphones and listen closely it's as if each song is a beautiful patchwork quilt.  Each little computer beep and toy piano plink make up different patches or textures of sound that show an extreme care to what is being presented to the listener.  And that, to me, is what ties the music to the message of Church Music.  The care and attention given to the music of this album reflects the weightiness and import of what is being conveyed through the lyrics, our relationship to our great God.The ConclusionLong-time fans will miss the acoustic guitar-based \"worship\" songs of previous albums, \"Church Music - Dance [!]\" will be a little too funky for some (myself included...for shame!), and \"God Almighty, None Compares\" will be a little too Trans-Siberian Orchestra for others, but rest assured, this is a great album.  Great not because of how great a band DCB is, which they are, but great because of, as \"The Veil\" proclaims, \"what a savior, what a king\" we have.The Favorites (so far)Shadows, How He Loves (single version), Can I Lie, Oh Happiness (possibly the most infectious, in a good way not the swine flu way, DCB song ever)\n", "val": 0.016114573925733566}

My wife and I went to the launch party at their home church in Waco Texas and it blew me away to see them play all of the sounds you will hear on this album live.  It's truly amazing to see how they creatively mix rock guitars and drums, hip hop bass rhythms, techno beats, string instruments, iPhone app synthesized voices, a robotic drummer named Steve and so much more to create a sound that is pleasing to me and I'm sure pleasing to God.  They are a band that is fulfilling God's call to cultivate the Earth through creating worship music.This is my favorite worship album from top to bottom ever.  The way that the band transitions from song to song makes me not want to skip anything - right down to the last song, \"In The End\", which is one of my favorites on the whole album.  It speaks of the eternal plans God has for us all and brings to the forefront of my mind what a great God we have and has got me asking myself how I can serve Him with my life today.  That is the impact this album has had on me after one week of listening.One of the reviews commented that the only thing wrong with the album is its name.  At the launch party David said they named it \"Church Music\" because what they are about is writing songs that the church, the people all over the world that call Jesus their Lord and Savior, can sing out in worship to God.  I too didn't know if I liked the album title at first, but in light of their explanation and that the album makes me want to do just that, it's just right.

{"text": "Many people criticize the Remedy album for being sub-par due to the phenomenal beauty and artistry that came out of all his other albums.However, I would only consider Crowder's Remedy album sub-par when compared to Crowder himself, if I were to compare the Remedy album to ANY other worship album, it would still COMPLETELY blow them out the water.That being said, this album deserves more than 5 stars, it would deserve 5 stars on a completely DIFFERENT Crowder standard.The production level put into this album is completely INSANE. Not many people understand how hard it is to produce electronic noises, you have to make/engineering these noises almost from scratch. Not just that, but if it doesn't sound good with the chord structures, rhythm, or the song itself, you have to start from scratch all over again, it's extremely tedious. They did this for the sole purpose of trying to create a new sound, feeling, expression, and emotion to be a band of people that are after God's own heart. It's amazing, it's as if they're trying to capture God's heart in a different way every year/album.Also, all the little effects and back tracks that they use are EXTREMELY intricate. If you listen closely, you'll hear some AMAZING recording/production techniques that are both creative and unconventional. You'll start hearing that there are some female vocals in the background here, footsteps there, sounds of nature,to wind, and synths that combine for a feeling and ambience that have never been felt or heard of before.I've listened to quality production recordings on many different levels in both secular and religious music, however, I've never heard a single album that is ANYwhere close to the level that this is on.The David Crowder* Band has definitely put a lot of time, energy, and heart into pleasing God with a new feeling and sound.

{"text": "The real question that was rattling in my head as I removed the shrinkwrap of DC*B's latest full length was, \"Is it possible for them to outdo 'A Collision'?\"  (Remedy was pretty good, but it shone [in my humble opinion] pale next to their previous 21 track masterwork.) I plugged the disc into my stereo... synthesizers and loops all over the place. My head began to bob involuntarily. I am absolutely blown away by what I am hearing.  Distinctly Crowder, but the envelope has been pushed so far out I forget everything I know. Infectious, melodic, intelligent, danceable, epic, awe-inspiring, worship.  Church. Music. I fumble for words to describe what David Crowder*Band has accomplished, not only musically, but thematically, philosophically and spiritually.  This record is a grand statement to anyone within earshot: Open your mind and reconsider what church music can/should be.  Crowder and company embrace pop music like a long lost friend, but lyrically they have, if anything, become even more bold and passionate about their love for Jesus.  They seem particularly fond of dance, synthpop and electronica this time around, but there are plenty of crunchy guitars, groovy bass lines and electric violins.  Standout tracks for me (and there are MANY) are 'Alleluia, Sing', 'The Nearness', 'Eastern Hymn', 'The Veil', 'We Are Loved', the reworked Flyleaf cover 'All Around Me', the incredibly moving 'How He Loves', the disco title track... I really could go on and on.  There's no filler here, which makes Church Music actually more substantial than 'A Collision.' And maintaining that type of consistency for 74 minutes is an accomplishment that very few in any genre can boast. This is a landmark record in the history of Christian music, and a full view of the shape of things to come.  I don't know how they did it, but my apprehensions about topping 'A Collision' have been allayed.

So Far Gone EP is nothing new however it gives fans a chance to own a real copy (or half copy at least) of one of the best mixtapes released in the past few years. The song that defined the summer appears here and for those not in the loop it's BEST I EVER HAD.  SUCCESSFUL is also on here in it's original glory (even though Trey Songz had to jack that for his album...I'm not mad).  The other songs are top notch as well which is why the EP has earned 5 stars.However, this EP is only for those that are new to Drake or like to have official things in their collection since So Far Gone The Mixtape came out over 5 months ago and contains more songs.  The one new song FEAR is included.  I admit I didn't buy the EP simply because this week I already put down for the Kid Cudi, Lil Boosie, and Trick Daddy.  But having listened to these songs for months it's easy for me to say that the EP is worth the measly $6 or $7 that you spend on it.

{"text": "I got into Drake a lot later than most people. Sure, I heard his songs on the radio and I thought they were pretty good, but it wasn't until I heard Thank Me Later that I became a true fan of Drake. So Far Gone has a different feel to it though, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. What I like about Drake is that he's not a stereotypical rapper from the hood that raps about being a gangster and all that. He grew up in a wealthy household in the suburbs and he doesn't try to act like he's anything else. His songs bring a different feel and story to them that is rare to find in rappers today. I really like all the songs on the album (though I did have to grow to like Uptown) except for Houstatlantavegas and the Calm, which weren't bad songs, i just wouldn't have them on repeat. Great start though and I hope to see more from Drake in upcoming years.\n", "val": 0.030666181817650795}

{"text": "I have been following Drake (Jimmy) since Degrassi. I thought that he was talented and a great actor and was destined for greatness. I then learned that he was a lyricist. I thought, oh no, here we go again. Here we go with another Nickelodeon person who thinks they can be successful releasing music. Then I heard \"Best I Ever Had\" and I hated it at first. I was thinking, what in the world was he thinking and he could have been recording another episode of Degrassi instead of this crap. But as I continued to listen I found myself singing it randomly during the day. I was laughing to myself because I knew I hated the song and now I cannot get enough of it. Then \"So Far Gone\" came out and it all fell into place for me. I enjoyed every track and could not wait for his next release. My ratings of this album is as follows:1. Houstatlantavegas: 3/5. This was a little more out of my style of liking than usual but good to listen to on occassion. Just not on repeat for me.2. Successful: 4/5. This was a great one but I think I like the version on Trey Songz album more.3. Best I Ever Had: 5/5. This song crept up on me and now I listen to this daily4. Uptown: 2/5. Was not one of my favorites by a long stretch.5. I'm Goin' In: 5/5. Was a great track. Maybe not radio friendly but this was a dope track!6. The Calm: 4/5. Good song7. Fear: 5/5. I related to this song so much it is eerie. \"And my uncle ain't even messaging me. And him missing in my life is kinda messing with me. I hope this isn't one of those forever things. It's funny how money can change everything.\" Touched a personal cord with me.All in all, this is worth every penny of your money so I hope you give it a listen!\n", "val": 0.0005869354936294258}

{"text": "I am a fan of Hip Hop not only in music but also the culture. I listen to a lot of rap music from the old gangsta rap music from N.W.A., to the intellectual teachings of KRS-One...to the raw lyrical deliveries from the likes of Nas, Rakim, Canibus...and also to the funky styles of A Tribe Called Quest so I know a little more about what good Hip Hop Music is really about. But over the last couple of years Hip Hop has been declining in quality of music, these days people only care about a good beat and don't care about the lyrical abilities of a rapper anymore. The most overrated and most talked about rapper would have to be Lil Wayne if anybody. People like Lil Wayne because of his so called \"hard hitting rhymes\" but in actuality its just kindergarden play on words and crappy analogies (but don't get me wrong because Lil Wayne does have his moments).DRAKE is the new rap phenomenom soon to become the new Lil Wayne, showing signs of upcoming success already working with some of musics veterans such as Kanye West, Mary J. Blige, Jay-Z, Eminem etc...This album is an EP of Drakes past songs mainly from his mixtape with the same name that came out earlier this year in February, as well as a couple of new ones. Drake doesn't have the same pinache as some rappers do, his delivery is basically the same in every song, his lyrical ability is questionable often reciting lines you would think Lil Wayne would say, and his musicality is very very basic. But even with all that negativity said, there is something about Drake I just like, he is basically the rapper in the game I hate to like.1) Houstatlantavegas - What makes Drake a bit better then other rappers is the fact that he has a little R&B touch to him, which makes him a lot more versitile in music. I acutally like Drakes voice when he sings even though he uses a little auto-tune to his voice. The song doesn't make much sense but its a nice opening song. 7/102) Successful feat. Trey Songz & Lil Wayne - a very long song, kinda boring at times. This song pretty much demonstrates the reasong why I believe Drake's flow is the same every time. His delivery is very boring at times and his lyrical ability is very cliche'. Trey Songz hook compliments the beat very well. I just think the song runs on a little too long, and Lil Wayne just comes up randomly at the end. 8/103) Best I Ever Had - this would have to be Drake's signature song. I heard this song back in March and thought it was OK at first. But then it came up on radio, it kept playing over and over again. Although this song is very overplayed, I still love it, its very catchy and definitely a song to be played over and over again. 10/104) Uptown feat. Bun B & Lil Wayne - yet another mong song running about 6 minutes long, and also yet another song featuring Lil Wayne. The song has a nice hook, I think I prefer Drakes singing over rapping cuz he just sounds very obnoxious over half of the time. Bun B has a strong verse and Lil Wayne yet again provides another short verse at the end. Good song but again runs a little too long. 9/105) I'm Goin In feat. Lil Wayne & Young Jeezy - Lil Wayne is on this album wayyyyy too much. This is a very cocky song, All three of em sound like a bunch of f***s, their delivery on this song is pretty decent but the lyrics are again obnoxious and don't really make much sense. This song however has a very hard bass hitting beat, this will be a song you would bump in your car fosho. 7/106) The Calm - The beat is actually very \"calm\" but Drake sounds very angry. His flow is the same (again) and the lyrics aren't that great. But the song itself isn't that bad. 6/107) Fearz - this is actually the only brand new song from Drake. The song is a lot better than the previous songs, his lyrics on this song is a lot better than previous songs. DJ Khalil provides a very nice beat and Drakes hook is pretty good. Not a bad way to end the album. 9/10\n", "val": 0.00023649496142752469}
{"text": "The new album ''So Far Gone'' by Drake is said to be amazing. The hit single Best I Ever Had is just thrilling. Along with songs such as ''Successful', and ''Uptown'' its a must have mix tape. With so much buzz around Drake its hard to not know who he is. His last mix tape, Room for Improvement was just an introduction  to So Far Gone and Drake himself. The 23 year old Drake hits you with so many songs he makes you not want to wait for the next Thank Me Later Album, his new album coming out out in 2010.

While the accolades grow too high, Drake does have talent.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/So-Far-Gone/dp/B002LVAZO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">So Far Gone</a>, his debut EP, showcases his talent. While not perfect, there is nothing truly bad on this EP. The biggest flaw one wonders is why couldn't the MC just have recorded a few more songs and penned this his debut album? At 33 minutes, would 40 or 45 minutes have been that much harder? Perhaps fear of more filler than substance pervaded the MC's mind and he opted for the EP.  Unfortunately for Yung Berg, who released an EP prior to his full length, his album bombed after his rushed EP&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Almost-Famous-EP/dp/B000R7I3S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Almost Famous EP</a>&nbsp;was released (and also bombed).  While Drake's showing is much better (73,000 in its first week) and with the advantage of being more consistent that Yung Berg could've ever hoped, Drakes album should still be anticipated - possibly more so after the showing of SO FAR GONE.The album deceptively opens up with the slightly awkward, \"Houstonlantavegas\", a song that finds the MC singing.  While it isn't a bad listen, it is a bit awkward, and definitely doesn't ring as a 'hit'.  It isn't a miss per say, but it doesn't necessary bode nearly as well as singles, following tracks \"Successful\" (feat. Trey Songz & Lil Wayne) or the more ubiquitous \"Best I Ever Had\".  Following those fine tracks, \"Uptown\" features an energized Drake accompanied by rap veteran Bun B, who has a strong verse here.  \"I'm Going In\" proves to be the 'promotional' track for Drake's forthcoming full-length effort, showing Drake 'harder' as an MC than his previous singles. Lil Wayne's appearance at the front of the track showcases that \"I'm Going In\" is no \"Best I Ever Had\" repeat;  Young Jeezy later affirms this with his verse.Both \"The Calm\" and \"Fear\" are solid with the \"Fear\" sounding like it could have easily appeared on a Common album as opposed to Drake's debut.  Essentially, the seven-song set is very strong, save for \"Houstonlantavegas\", which isn't bad. It does build anticipation for the full length, but again, the question is asked why wasn't his made into the full-length debut? 4 stars, nonetheless.\n", "val": 0.00018244267266709358}

{"text": "Country music tributes to one's father seem to be in the air. Tanya Tucker's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/My-Turn/dp/B001SZ27WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Turn</a>&nbsp;provides a gritty set of her father's favorites, and Rosanne Cash's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-List/dp/B0029LHW5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The List</a>&nbsp;cherry-picks a dozen songs from a list of one hundred country essentials given to her by her father in the 1970s. In both cases the artists had to dig deeply within themselves to understand not only what the songs meant to their fathers, but also what they meant as an inheritance and how they could be co-owned by both father and child. That same conundrum faced Ricky Skaggs as he mapped out this tribute to the songs his father loved, and he took the highly personal approach of producing the album on his own.Though technically a solo work, as Skaggs sang and played everything here, a more accurate attribution would be to the All Ricky Skaggs Band. Rather than performing as a solo singer with his guitar, Skaggs overdubbed himself singing harmonies and playing multiple instruments, including guitar, mandolin, banjo, bass and piano. Built up as acoustic one-man-band arrangements, this isn't the hot-picked bluegrass of Kentucky Thunder, but a more relaxed approach to music making. Skagg's explores his parental heritage, but also his own musical roots in a very personal extension of 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Honoring-the-Fathers-of-Bluegrass-Tribute-to-1946-and-1947/dp/B0014DC0ZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Honoring the Fathers of Bluegrass: Tribute to 1946 and 1947</a>.The song list is heavy on traditional numbers, including the instrumental fiddle tunes \"Colonel Prentiss\" and \"Calloway.\" Skaggs' own instrumental, \"Pickin' in Caroline\" features banjo playing that's gentle and introspective. One song each by Fred Rose (\"Foggy River\") and Roy Acuff (\"Branded Wherever I Go\") speak to the foundational importance of the Acuff-Rose publishing company, and Ralph Stanley's \"Little Maggie\" links to Skaggs' teenage membership in the legend's bluegrass band. This is superbly selected collection of songs, many of which fall outside the standard festival repertoire.Singing and playing on his own, without the band, without the burden of living a bluegrass legend, without anything on his mind but his father and the lasting inspiration of his music, Skaggs is freed to embrace this material with a closeness that's harder to locate in a crowded, spot-lit setting. Fans will enjoy the opportunity to hear Skaggs close-up in this stripped-down setting, and those who love country music's early years will doubly enjoy the songbook. 4-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

This was jaw dropping when I heard Stevie sing this classic! It is outstanding and truly gives the song more \"life\". Lindsey's version on the Fleetwood Mac album was good, the Buckingham Nicks is more folk like. Stevie's is more modern and flows like a fine stream...dreamy.Glad to have heard this song at the end of the Practical Magic movie or I wouldn't have known it even existed, even being a Stevie Nicks fan.

And lemme tell you, the genre duo works beautifully.The album from start to finish has a perfect flow, and song order definitely sets that up.  The opening track is easily the most important; giving the listener a perfect idea of the different sounds to come. So perfect in fact that listening to the sample should make decision making process a breeze.This is a great CD.  Metal and melody laced with some trance.  I urge everyone to give this a shot, I don't think you will be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.03377722576260567}
{"text": "This is the absolute best release of 2009, absolutely everything was done right on this CD. Heavy breakdowns mixed with guttural screams/growls and clean vocals all with a little hint of Techno.Asking Alexandria is truely an original sound that will get your head moving to it's rhythm. This CD is constantly played on my Ipod when I'm driving. I can't say enough about the band and am looking forward to their sophmore album.\n", "val": 0.02752196043729782}
{"text": "This album is amazing. It encompasses all forms of music that have come around in the last twenty years with the exception of country and rap. The lyrics are thought provoking and interesting as you slowly figure what they are actually saying. They utilize several different vocal styles from deep growls remeniscent of early 90s death metal to gutteral growls similar to the early days of Carcass. They also utilize some screams and clean vocals, some acompany music that reminds one of all the boy bands that appeared in the 90s. These sections are brief and add to the overall texture of the music. Every style they utilize has been done before, however, the mix is phenomenal. It creates a landscape of sound that is at one moment visceral and the next serene. The album as a whole has a flow to it as well. This is a rare album that has 13 singles but at the same time, is more complete as a whole. Since I found this album, i have not stopped listening to it (about four weeks now). Even my wife enjoyed it and her usual is onerepublic and bucky covington. This music spans so much without being pigeonholed into any one genre. Buy this album and you will not be dissappointed. easily the best of 09!!!\n", "val": 0.03595402091741562}

{"text": "Sorry for the caps, it's just that this CD is filled with awesomeness. I recently purchased the new Used CD, Saosin CD, and Muse CD. Since I enjoyed all of their previous albums, I have been disappointed by each one, especially the new Used CD - Artwork, since they are my favorite band.Anyways, I thought I would try something new. After reviewing this month's AP magazine featuring Paramore, I stumbled upon this new CD Asking Alexandria, I heard a few samples on Amazon, then I decided to pick up the CD at Hot Topic.Man...I haven't been happy with a CD purchase in months! This whole album is amazing, it's so unique, I haven't heard anyone like them.What makes them unique is their vocals, and they add a lot of different sounds to their tracks, it's not some repetitive sound like many emo/screamo/metal bands.For instance, their songs may have the deep demonic sounding gurgling vocals, then will jump to the scream at the top of your lungs vocals, then the song will jump into the harmonious emo soft vocals, then jump back into the screams.They even have tracks that include a lot of techno/electronica! Techno mixed with screamo, that is an amazing combo, I love it! I wish more bands did this...on second thought...no I don't, because then other bands would just be copying Asking Alexandria, that is why they are unique.Track 1 has an example of the techno/guitar riffs. Then track 6 is a electronic type of song; tracks 11, 12 and 13 also includes some electronica. There are probably more, I am still listening to the CD as I am typing this review!Tracks 6,7,8,9 and 11 are my favorites. The bass hits are incredible on my 2 10\" subs. Buy this CD now!\n", "val": 0.007062405813485384}

{"text": "All I can say here, is wow!This band, now being one of the most prominent groups in the metalcore genre alongside bands such as Bring Me The Horizon and Of Mice & Men, has started off with a rather strong debut album!Stand Up and Scream is a powerful onslaught of a mix of metalcore and electronicore. Heavy guitars, occasional nuances of electronics and synthesizer work, and well done vocals from singer Danny Worsnop. His range going from amazing clean singing, to high pitch screams and low guttural growls.The most notable songs for me are \"The Final Episode (Let's Change the Channel)\", \"Everyday's the Weekend\", \"I Used to Have A Best Friend (But then He Gave Me an STD)\", \"Hey There, Mr. Brooks\", \"I Was Once Possibly, Maybe, Perhaps, A Cowboy King\", \"A Prophecy\", and \"Not the American Average\".Although the song titles can be a bit long, and for a few of them maybe a little awkward, they are still great songs.One thing's for sure, Metalcore, like Nu Metal, is often looked down upon by Metalheads who are more familiar with older and more traditional forms of heavy metal. Mostly because it's \"not metal\" to them for not having that feel that older metal bands have. Or that it's \"unoriginal\" or \"watered-down\" for them. And of course, there's always the elitists in metal who will relentlessly and immaturely heckle anything other than their favorite band(s).Don't listen to those guys, and don't let anyone bring you down saying your taste is music is \"crap\". Listen to whatever you want, and whatever makes you happy and feel good. Ive opened my mind up to bands like asking alexandria two years ago, and now I'm in love with them. I personally think it's silly (even downright comical) to say metalcore is not metal.It being a fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk, it sounds like both to me. The way I see it, fusion genres are genres of both or all their fusing elements. Same thing applies to Nu Metal, Deathcore, etc.Anyway...So much has went into this album from what has become an incredible band. Releasing two more great albums, \"Reckless and Relentless\" in 2011, and \"From Death to Destiny\" in 2013, this band has come quite a way and progressed in their music, perfecting everything that needed some tweaking.Listen to this album with an open mind, and theres a chance youll be impressed, either a little or a lot!\n", "val": 0.015525325201451778}

{"text": "I have an 11 year old daughter, and was worried that all the modern heavy bands were too old for her generation. About the most \"edgy\" music that kids have today is Dubstep, which, admittedly, I enjoy - but if you look at the most popular thrash, hardcore, or metal bands right now, they're all bands full of people my age. Where are the kids gonna turn for heavy music?I caught the video for The Final Episode, and had to find more from AA. Bought this album, was not disappointed.The kids are alright.The mix of clean, death, and screamo vocals on this album is outstanding. Danny has a hell of a lot of vocal range.Dynamically, the music on this album is tight. Bass, drums, and guitar blast out staccato rhythms that positively shred. I heard this band is considered \"trance metal,\" but the electronic use here is extremely subdued on most songs. When it's applied, it forms a kind of interesting break in the song, before the guitars ramp back up and blow you away.My only beef with this album is that some of the lyrics aren't very good. They range from the banal, to the childish, to the downright misogynist. I'm not a screaming hyper-feminist type, but there's really no excuse for a song that devolves into screaming about how a girl he's banging is a \"stupid f***ing wh*re.\" Seriously, that track, \"Not The American Average,\" is kinda ruined by the lyrics.Overall, I enjoy listening to this album for the music, and just avoid the couple of tracks that don't really do it for me. But I no longer worry that my kid's generation won't have anything heavy to listen to. The kids are still making heavy music. The kids are still being too loud.\n", "val": 5.6048495025606826e-05}

The breakdowns are simple but heavy and extremely satisfying, and sprinkling a little bit of techno into it is freaking awesome. The song titles are funny, but the lyrics are more serious and well written. They're not going to blow your mind with metaphors and deep thought, but their messages are real and they sing/scream the words with passion. I'm definitely keeping an eye out for them on tour and I'm going to see them as soon as they are anywhere close.

Asking Alexandria does a good job at keeping you interested with they're simple but heavy breakdowns and they're Dance/Trance beats but let's go over the album as a whole.*Negative*So the first song I ever heard from Asking Alexandria was \"The Final Episode\", it started off pretty strong and had me going up until the vocalist screamed the words \"Oh My God\" over and over in unison with the breakdown. If that wasn't bad enough I had to endure the overly annoying 2-string picking that happened right before the vocalist screamed \"OMG\". Also, they do this a lot through out the album which really annoys me.*Positive*By now (if you are a fan) you probably hate me for the negative comments. At least with this band there are some redeeming qualities! For instance, after the slow, boring, cliche breakdown it gets kind of interesting. Finally, the Trance beat comes in and even though it really isn't much it still seperates the dull boring part of the song from the awesome parts. Somewhere near the end of the song you can actually hear how intricate some of the guitar parts are. In fact rather than playing in the scale they were playing in they change it up with some augmented notes that make it sound amazing.As for the rest of the album, it all sounds the same in my opinion. It's like they are afraid to deviate from the formula that they made themselves and rather than being innovative and experiment a little they tend to always open up with a breakdown or a really simple riff. It really sucks because if you listen to one of they're songs only half of it is worth listening to....but that's my opinion.If you are really into Post-Hardcore bands or Metal-Core you should at least check this band out on Youtube because if you buy it you are only getting half of what you payed for.Also! If you are into Bring Me The Horizon you will most likely think that this band is a crappy version of BMTH with Dance beats.\n", "val": 0.00010390611714683473}

{"text": "I've seen Celtic Woman twice at Radio City Music Hall and was dissappointed when Orla dropped out before the beginning of the most recent tour.  It was said that she was recording an album but I was dubious.  Several years ago, Meav, another of the Celtic Women, dropped out and it was said she was recording her own album as well.  I have yet to see it.  I thought the same thing was happening here.  Boy was I wrong.This is an absolutely wonderful album and Orla has never sounded better or sweeter.  I won't go into all of the songs but my favorite is the song \"Always There.\"  Absolutely gorgeous.  I also love the title track \"Distant Shore\" and the first track \"Who Knows.\"  However all the other tracks are wonderful as well. I listen to it in my car and find it totally relaxing.  I saw Orla recently on PBS and surprisingly she looks younger and better than on the previous DVDs from 2004 and 2006 (not that she looked bad there either.)  Some of us are getting older, Orla gets younger.In conclusion, this is a wonderful album and a triumph for Orla.  I highly recommend it.\n", "val": 0.03738769516348839}

Her voice is better suited for traditional Irish tunes and her faithful harp that sets her apart from other Celtic singers, not for pop. Her harp is barely heard on here, replaced with the piano and a much-louder band that doesn't fit with her voice style. The songs she wrote are catchy and pretty, but the lyrics aren't that great. I was also disappointed that she didn't choose to either cover a song by Clannad (her covers with Celtic Woman were stunning)or find a similar yet unique style, as that would have fit her nicely.While I can appreciate Orla wanting to try new things, but I think her venture into the realm of pop is not really her true style and is a departure from her Irish roots that set her apart in her Celtic Woman days.\n", "val": 7.137712964322418e-05}

{"text": "I'm so surprised at the people who are reviewing this album and saying that Orla's first album was so much better. My ears must be messed up or something, because I think Distant Shore is a MUCH better album than The Water is Wide. To be honest, The Water is Wide put me right to sleep. It had no personality at all and I thought the songs all sounded exactly the same. Distant Shore is such an improvement!!!! The songs are well-written and have much more of a \"pop\" feel to them, and the album as a whole has a little more variety. I really think that makes this album appeal to a wider audience. I can \"identify\" with the songs a bit more. So, in short, this is SUCH an improvement over The Water is Wide.The best song on this album is \"Distant Shore,\" by far. No contest. However, for me \"Who Knows?\" is not far behind, and nor is \"Always There\" or \"Shooting Star.\" The first 7 songs are my favorite, the remaining 8 are okay, but they had to grow on me a little bit. There are a few I don't care for, but that's typical for me for nearly any album (save Lisa Kelly's), so overall I absolutely adore this album and listen to it a lot!

The songs that she does author are good and the other selection are interesting, but there is nothing on this release that I would consider stellar.

{"text": "Orla Fallon recorded a few solo albums and then joined up with the group/PBS-phenomenon Celtic Woman, recording and touring with them for four years. She's left the group and this is her first post CW album. She has a built-in fan base from the legion of CW fans and these fans won't be disappointed here. As part of CW he really had no name; she was \"one of those women on stage playing and singing Celtic music\". Here, she not only has a name and face but Fallon herself composed three of the tracks.She sings as well as plays the harp and there is only one fully instrumental track among the 13 on the CD. Personally, I think another instrumental earlier in the album would have paced the music better. \"Dancing in the Moonlight\" was actually written as an instrumental but Fallon decided to sing along. Though she says that she wanted to include some \"Americana\" in the mix (no, not Willie Nelson or Robert Earl Keen songs) and so we get a \"Celtic version\" of Little Feat's \"Voices in the Wind\" and the beautiful a capella version of Stephen Foster's \"Hard Time Come Again No More\" for the closing track. (The strings come in later in the song.).This CD is on the Green Hill label, which is primarily sold in gift shops, and features generic titles that never even list the performer, or compilations of \"licensed\" tracks compiled in to jazz or oldies albums. This is a departure and I'm sure that Fallon's beautiful vocals will attract shoppers to ask, \"Who is that singing? Is that Celtic Woman?\". Then the store clerk can answer: \"No, actually its just ONE of the Celtic Woman.

{"text": "fellow aussie musician and beasts of bourbon/kim salmon and the surrealists' bass player, brian henry hooper (check out his solo albums as well - they are well worth the investment), has referred to rowland s. howard as the \"laziest\" musician in the business, obviously in regards to the 10-yr gap between howard's solo albums (on which hooper contibuted his bass playing to both), but considering the circumstances in which these albums were made (death of his mother, divorce, relapse into heroin addiction, getting hep-c and liver cancer, and facing death with superhuman grace when many others might well have taken the easy way out), one might conclude that hooper's criticism of a rock and roll legend of howard's stature was more out of encouragement, love, and admiration. that being said, the 10-yr gap was well worth the wait and quite an achievement when one considers the circumstances in which pop crimes was made.after several well-documented and intense years backing nick cave in the seminal swamp/noise/blues/punk/rock legends, the birthday party (who have influenced everyone from pj harvey to the jesus lizard to the drones), and stints playing with crime and the city solution and lydia lunch in the '80s, howard made a name for himself as a virtuoso guitarist - the \"crown prince of the crying jag.\" it wasn't until fronting his own outstanding and often overlooked band, these immortal souls (featuring epic soundtracks [swell maps] on drums), until the mid-90s that howard began getting well-deserved recognition as a singer/songwriter as well, as his songwwriting contributions were often overshadowed by those of nick cave (many seem to have forgotten or are unaware that howard wrote one of the birthyday party's first \"hits\" [\"shivers\"] before they had changed their name from the boys next door and moved to england).in this writer's opinion, howard's first solo album (teenage snuff film) outshined most, if not all, of cave's post-birthday party output, and that is a bold statement to make when one considers cave/bad seeds classics such as your funeral, my trial and from her to eternity. still, i stand by that statement and will go a step further in stating that pop crimes is just as solid, if not more so, than his first solo outing. unlike teenage snuff film, howard's guitar playing is more succinct on pop crimes, while his goldilox lyrics, as a whole, present a dictum that could only be articulated so well, direct, and without artifice by someone with the experience, humility, and intelligence to grasp the reality of not only his own condition, but the human condition as it stands (check out \"the golden age of bloodshed\"). hashing it out posthumously, songs such as \"shut me down\" and the well-chosen and venerable interpretation of talk talk's \"life's what you make it\" are redefined with a vexatious, yet dignified demeanor. getting down to brass tacks, the original tracks are well-crafted and affecting, as are the judicious selection of covers. as a result, pop crimes, like all great art, draws you into its distinct nature and is a exceptional experience for the listener; it's more than just a collection of great songs.dear rowland - may you rest in peace (if mr. pew allows, of course).\n", "val": 0.018552297726273537}
{"text": "Not hearing so much as a word from the great Spaghetti-Western, Post-punk, Death-rock minimalist Rowland S. Howard in nearly 10 years since his brilliant Australian only release \"Teenage Snuff Film\", Mr. Howard puts out a new CD \"Pop Crimes\" merely a few weeks before his eminent demise from liver cancer on December 30, 2009. Unlike the previous release, and also after an extended hiatus from commercial production in which those songs emerged organically over a long period of time of trial and error playing in his hometown of Melbourne, the songs that exist on \"Pop Crimes\" often reflect the fact that they were hastily assembled and have the feeling of musical ideas rather than fully-fleshed out composition. The two true gems here are \"(I Know) A Girl Called Jonny\" and \"Pop Crimes\", although the repetition of the chorus on the latter may end up getting on one's last nerve. The idea of an R.S.H. version of Talk Talk's hit song \"Life's What You Make It\" in theory sounds brilliant, alas the one that ends up on the recording sounds rather sleepy, and well, sad. After waiting so long for a new release by such an outstanding musician and songwriter, Pop Crimes leaves you wondering what this record would have sounded like had Mr. Howard had just a bit more time to flesh out his ideas - and a bit more time on this earth.

Track two, \"The Guitar\", sent chills up my spine the first time around and has continued to thrill in several subsequent listenings.Every song on this album is well crafted and the guitar work superb.

{"text": "Magic occurred again today, and it all started with me taking a simple walk down to the mailbox. I received an advance copy of Guy Clark's new record from Dualtone, Somedays the Song Writes You.Sometimes reviews can be extremely difficult to write and you have to listen repeatedly until the words come. Sometimes the words don't come and you have to put the music back up on the shelf. Other times it becomes much easier and like the title of this masterpiece, somedays the review writes you.This album is like that. It's so good; I was just able to sit at the computer, place my fingers on the keyboard and go.Songs like these helped me to fall in love with Mr. Clark's music in the first place. It's an absolute fact, Guy Clark is a poet. His words are always so abundantly rich in texture and this record is no exception. I frankly do not know how the man keeps doing it. He is a brilliant lyricist, a wordsmith, and that is what wordsmiths do. They have the uncanny ability to make words work together, to intertwine, and ultimately paint a picture in your head. There is the original painting in Mr. Clark's head. Then there is the picture in your head. He is so skillful at this, I'm willing to wager big money (if I had any) that our paintings are awfully damn close to being the same. He's just that proficient at projecting an image with words.Most of the time I'll take two or three songs and write a little on each one. I'm not going to do that this time. There is no need. Every tune on this record is absolutely incredible. I envision the musicians all sitting around in a semi-circle in the middle of a dimly lit smoke hazed room, no amps along with the ever present humming in the background. Everything is in tune, the instruments and the musicians; there is a rhythm to everything and everyone.The room is being held hostage by the leader of the musicians, Guy Clark. No one can leave, but most importantly, no one has the desire to. Everyone wants to be present. They all want to be a part of the magic and contribute to the master's vision.The one song I will mention is \"If I Needed You\", given to us by Townes Van Zandt a long time ago. Guy and Susan Clark were most likely the very first humans to have ever heard the song after Townes dreamt it while staying with them in their home. Guy Clark possesses and exhumes an obvious reverence to this special tune. I felt a great deal of gratitude he decided to include it with the rest of these masterfully written tunes.Mr. Clark had several accomplices for this particular undertaking. Verlon Thompson joins him on acoustic guitar and harmony vocals. Kenny Malone helps with the drums and percussion duties. Bryn Davies plays the upright bass and sings harmony, and finally, he chose Shawn Camp to play the mandolin and sing harmony as well. You can tell by the fine quality of the performances on the record, they were nearly as much in love with this project as Mr. Clark was.Guy Clark, Verlon Thompson, and Chris Latham produced the album. In addition, the record was recorded, mixed, and mastered at EMI Studios in Nashville by Chris Latham.Like I said at the beginning of this review, I don't know how he keeps doing it, but I'm sure glad he does. `Rebel' Rod says check it out.\n", "val": 0.019017789512872696}
{"text": "The songwriter's craft of juxtaposing words to describe a person, scene or situation or to communicate a feeling is only the surface of a process that starts deep within. The ability to step outside one's own moment to describe what's happening or happened, to recognize, observe and frame an experience in which one may be an active participant, is the more ephemeral side of songwriting. It's something that few do as well as Guy Clark, and married to finely selected words, his songs provide uncommonly detailed and communicative windows into moments and people who might otherwise pass unobserved.In the title song, Clark addresses the alchemical process of songwriting. He notes that songs often appear to songwriters from thin air to exert themselves into being. But with a writer of Clark's caliber, years of practice has left him open to divine these works, to snatch a moment of consciousness out of the rushing river of living. On \"Hemingway's Whiskey\" he communes writer to writer about the debilitating muse, offering a personal glimpse into the pain of writing, and a picture of drinking as a chronic enabler rather than the classic reactive salve to lost love. Clark is equally effective sketching the seedy side of town, conjuring the scene of a seafarer's final voyage, and animating a pawn shop guitar. The latter's twist ending is laid in a lovely flurry of acoustic finger picking.The album is filled with lush acoustic playing from Clark and Verlon Thompson, and the rhythms of Kenny Malone (drums) and Bryn Davies (bass) provide a stable but subtle bottom end. Clark's voice has weathered over the years, and though it's never been the prettiest or most melodic instrument, it's filled with emotion, particularly when covering his late friend Townes Van Zandt's \"If I Needed You.\" His co-writes with Rodney Crowell, Shawn Camp, Gary Nicholson, as well as several up-and-coming writers, bring together two generations of his disciples. Clark's long been a \"songwriter's songwriter,\" but he's never stopped working on his craft, and the results are plain to hear on this latest release.

{"text": "Well, actually Guy's song says \"Stuff That Works\", but I get the idea!!  :-)My first exposure to Guy Clark was his \"Old Friends\" album (HIGHLY recommended!), when I heard the song \"Old friends\" one week and \"Immigrant Eyes\" the next on a Philly folk music show... and thanks to Gene Shay for that!!It's hard to believe that Guy has been around for thirty-five years and is still writing some of the best songs around.  I see Guy's work as a piece; not that you have to be familiar with all of it in order to appreciate this album... It all hangs together so damn well.  Guy once said that Townes' writing was \"seamless\".  I'd like to suggest that Guy's is equally so.\"Some Days The Song Writes You\", \"Hemingway's Whiskey\", \"The Guitar\", Maybe I Can Paint Over That\"... Any of the songs on this album would fit well in any of the other truly superb albums he's done.  This is another wonderful bunch of songs from a GREAT songwriter.On final thing: If you have the chance to see Guy and Verlon in concert, crawl over ground glass to do it!  I've seen them play a fair number of times, from Spicewood, Texas to New York City, with many points in between... and loved every show!  Hang around for a while after the show and he'll even talk to you... and maybe show you how to open a CD the easy way!!  And Verlon is one of the nicest people you will ever meet!!Guy Clark... As that song also says, \"Stuff That Holds Up\"!!\n", "val": 0.03133974224328995}

It grew on me after repeated listenings, but not enough for me to be knocked out. To my ears, his voice is showing signs of wear, and that makes me a little sad. The songs are a mixed of bag; some real grabbers and others than sound like he's covering territory he's done previously, and done better. I wanted to give this a higher rating, just because I love Guy Clark's songs so much. But I can't rate the past in this case, only this one album, and I think it's just not one of his better ones.

The songs display the famous craftsmanship of the master songbuilder but they feel much like some of his earlier songs.\"Maybe I Can Paint Over That\" borderlines on self plagiarism. The vocal phrasing is almost identical to his classic \"Magdaleine\". The theme of the song is different but while listening to it I can't put \"Magdaleine\" out of my head.There are other songs that have chord progressions and rhythmic passages that are similar to songs from his legendary catalogue. I could hear bits of \"Tornado Time In Texas\" in the song \"Hollywood\". It also seems to cover similar themes to his iconic \"LA Freeway\". There is a version of this song on YouTube that is more interesting than the one chosen for this record.I, truly, wanted to like this record more than I did.\n", "val": 0.0030449654441326857}

Guy Clark's right, somedays you push to get the creative juices working and others it seems like ghosts are riding you.  A cliche, but this song nails the creative process.Whether the other ten songs were efforts Guy wrote or got from some other cosmic source, they're full of heart and power.  \"Guitar\" talks about every musician's dream,  finding that 'soul guitar' in a pawn shop.  I heard this song live at Tennessee Shines and I swear the hair stood up on the back of my neck, it's so powerful.  Then, there's whiskey, weather, and women and a whole lot of other topics that only a man who's been there can write about.If you're just starting with Guy Clark, this CD's a great place to begin.

{"text": "The Good:Cranius has an excellent singing voice and he uses it well in this CD, even the one track I don't like is well sung.Big Blue Dress: This song, and the music video I watched on Youtube is how I heard about Cranius and his work. It's a fun, tongue in cheek kind of song that I've listened many times before and since I got the CD.Darrowshire: A very poignant song about a storyline that happens within it's namesake town within the Eastern Plaguelands. If you play WoW and you've never done these quests, shame on you. :P The story is fantastic, if sad and this song distills it very well. One of the two song I've memorized from this CD, the other being Big Blue Dress.Happy Place: An amusing song that's even funnier if you watch the music video.Don't Make Me Get My Main: A song that is germane to any game where you have PVP. The ending had my friends in stitches.The Bad:Hands down the only truly bad thing about this CD is the fact of its brevity. At a grand total of 16 minutes, if you want to listen to this while traveling somewhere, you better not be going far. This is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.The Lament of Captain Placeholder: While the singing is just as good as any of the other songs, the song itself is... not to my tastes. I find it ironic that the only song on the CD I'm not fond of is the one that happens to be a cover.Overall:  Other than Darrowshire, you do not have to be a WoW fan to enjoy the music on this CD. If you've ever played any kind of MMO, you will get the music. Even with Darrowshire as said before the song distills the storyline very well. Those of us that play WoW will just know the details.  I find this CD well worth the money and have no regrets buying it. If he comes out with another Its almost certain I'll be buying it.\n", "val": 0.004205251112580299}

{"text": "Some pundits are saying that this, \"The Chick Corea Songbook,\" is the Manhattan Transfer's best album ever.  Considering who the M.T. is, that's quite a claim.  Is the claim valid?  My 3 cents worth:In terms of production, absolutely.  It is not only the best in that respect, it is one of the best vocal jazz ensemble recordings ever.  Executive producer Yusuf Gandhi deserves all the credit he can muster for this; and main instrumentalist, keyboardist Yaron Gershovsky, is eerily on the money in terms of channelling the sounds of Chick Corea.However, that's not to say the album is overproduced, by any means.  The recording starts and ends with the lush \"Free Samba,\" and the Corea signature song, \"Spain,\" goes from majestic Espanol to funk, all on a dime.  But any production of the music of Chick Corea must acknowledge the composer's playfulness, his sense of fun.  And this one certainly does.  \"La Chanson du Bebe\" is utterly charming, and \"Another Roadside Attraction (\"Space Circus\") is fascinating.The Transfer itself has never sounded better.  The a capella intro to \"500 Miles High\" is even more impressive for its harmonic complexities than \"A Nighingale Sang in Berkeley Square\"; vocal jazz ensembles of America, take note!  Alan Paul sounds exquisite on \"Time's Lie\"; ditto to Janis Siegel and the c.d.'s most memorable tune, \"The Story of Anna & Armando\" (\"Armando's Rhumba.\")But best ever?  This c.d. leaves me feeling on the outside, with utter awe and admiration.  \"Vocalese,\" on the other hand, left me feeling on the inside, wanting to dance and sing with \"vocal jazz' fab four.\"  That one is still my favorite; and even \"Swing,\" I think, is more enjoyable.Nevertheless, this is a fabulous album and deserves to be remembered as such.  Jazz Times recently rated this one in its top 50 albums of 2009 (#47).  High praise for a vocal ensemble c.d.; but I can certainly see why.  RC\n", "val": 0.043531760573387146}

{"text": "Vocalese is a style or genre of jazz singing wherein lyrics are written for melodies that were originally part of an all-instrumental composition or improvisation.Whereas they may not have invented the genre (credit Eddie Jefferson for that), or are most closely associated with it (that would be Lambert, Hendricks and Ross), but Cheryl Bentyne, Tim Hauser, Alan Paul and Janis Siegel - collectively known as The Manhattan Transfer - have almost single-handedly (and four-voicedly) kept Vocalese alive during the last quarter-century.Beginning with their 1985 album called Vocalese, which received 12 Grammy nominations, they have generally included one or more vocalese songs on almost every one of their albums. Now they have gone back to a complete CD of vocalese, this time with \"The Chick Corea Songbook\" and in the process have recorded their most energetic, engaging collection in years.After nearly 40 years together their harmonies are effortless and flawless and the brilliance of their vocal musicianship still mesmerizes and awes.

Trademark close harmonies and vocalese that is unparalleled are the hallmarks of The Manhattan Transfer, and this album is no exception. Free Samba and Times Lie are excellent examples of this.My only criticism of the album is one of the same issues I had with the Vibrate album. Everything seems to be 10-20 Beats Per Minute too slow. Their rendition of Spain* (I Can Remember) is a good example. It's a song that has all the makings of greatness, wrecked by a plodding beat.

{"text": "AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.Do The Joy - an odd track to start the album with. Nonetheless, a good indicator of the albums flow and overall feel. The song sounds like something from 10,000 Hz Legend, with it's multi-layered synth forefront and distorted voice effects. Not the albums strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least. 7/10Love - once again, not your typical 'second' song. It holds a sense of simplicity though, and as the song progresses it turns from a basic loop into a nice, soft-like piece with a great chord progression and melody (the glockenspiel adds an awesome feel). Sounds like something you'd hear at the end of Moon Safari - especially the later half of the piece. It wasn't my favourite at first, but after a few listens it grew on me. 7/10So Light Is Her Football - the first song to really feature lyrical dynamics. The music sounds Pocket Symphony era, with the song being driven by piano and hovering strings. I heard (or read) somewhere that this will be the second single off the album. An odd decision I believe, but who knows - maybe it needs more listens. The song seems a little bland at some points, but holds suspense from an instrumentation point of view. 6/10Be A Bee - definitely not a song you'd think AIR would produce. With it's western-like feel, the song sounds like something off a surfing documentary. It's fun but also lacks differentiation (on all fronts). It could have done with some structuring overhauling. Not the greatest song on the album but hey - that's something you'll probably be use to at this stage, right? 6/10Missing The Light Of The Day - an interesting tune with some rather unique sounds. If you've ever seen AIR live you'd know what I'm talking about. They seem to produce some pretty funky patches throughout their set, and this song is a pretty good indicator of that. If you've heard any of Brian Eno's earlier albums you could make a comparison with this songs psuedo-alternatuve twist. Nothing overly exciting, but a worthwhile listen. 7/10Tropical Disease - the albums longest tune and one of the best, in my opinion. Contrary to what I've mention so far with regards to lyrical absence, I've always been one to fancy AIR's instrumental tracks. I believe it takes a higher-level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience, depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical-presence. The song sounds like two turned into one. The first half is up beat and has a similar essence to Be a Bee. As it progresses it slows down into an ambient plateau, reminiscent of something off Talkie Walkie. 8/10Heavens Light - definitely one of the albums standout tracks. It'd be right at home with the likes of La Femme d'Argent and Ce Matin La. Probably the albums most 'chill-out' number, with it's swirling progressions (especially towards the middle half) and heavenly vocal scene. My personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune. 10/10Night Hunter - another instrumental track with a great beat to it. Cross the electronica soundscapes of 10,000 Hz Legend and add the piano-driven feel of (the majority of) Pocket Symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down-tempo-like rhythm. A great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of AIR. 9/10Sing Sang Sung - well what can we say about this! Easily AIR's most accessible pop-song to date with an amazing effort from the boys and their female vocalist. With a musical infusion that sounds like something from a Tlpopmusik album, this number is easily one of the best on the entire album. Simple yet so effective in its delivery. There's just enough contrast between chorus, verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel. If you're going to get someone into this album, nay, AIR themselves, this might be a good starting point! 10/10Eat My Beat - one of the shortest on the album. The song is a good break from the ambient/instrumental-driven latter half of the album. With it's brewing crescendos mid day through the piece, it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest. 8/10You Can Tell It To Everybody - an awesome chill-out track to begin the closing stage of the album. Once again, I find myself being reminded of the later half of Moon Safari with this one. `New Star In The Sky (Chanson Pour Solal)' would have this as it's little sister. Acoustic and laid-back in it's approach, this tune is a near perfect night song. With it's distorted harmonica interludes, it's bound to sooth whatever sorrow you're experiencing and take you to a calmer place. 9/10African Velvet - whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer, African Velvet is probably one of the most interesting tracks on the album. With it's hand-picked guitar segments, and it's front-line horn melody, it's a perfect way to close of this special album. With a smooth bass line, hinting the likes of La Femme d'Argent, Velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note. A great way to close off Love 2. 8/10I gave this effort from AIR four stars in the end. But I'm not ruing out a higher score. It's definitely an album that needs a few listens for it to really soak in. Not as accessible as their earlier albums, but for anyone who's been hanging for a different approach fomr these French ambient-masters, your wait is over. If I could relate it to any album previously released, I'd say 10,000 Hz Legend. On one hand this album may be sour for fans of AIR's more chill-out tunes, but on the other `Love 2' has the makings of attracting a whole new market/denomination of listeners from all corners of the music globe. Give it a go and don't give up after a few listens...it'll grow on you. Trust me!\n", "val": 0.0014499450335279107}
{"text": "The French duo known as Air has returned with their unique brand of spacey future-jazz, and long-time listeners are rewarded with the band's finest effort since their seminal \"Moon Safari\" changed perspectives on the possibilities that can be created when genuine musicianship is matched with talented production.  The downtempo wizardry that has become the band's staple returns full-fledged, begging for play during a weekend dalliance with a lover (or two).  Unlike all of Air's albums, however, where only a handful of songs ever punch the throttle and generally just provide a little curveball among the more prevalent relaxing numbers, Love 2 gives listeners a healthy-dose of toe-tappers sprinkled with the little confectionary delights that have always emanated from their sugary-sweet soundboards.  The band is at its absolute finest when the androgynous combination of members Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benot Dunckel's voices serve as another instrument rather than a clear delineation between lyric and music, and although used sparingly, often meld into the songs in a fashion that has some shoegaze-like qualities.  The brilliant and diverse track \"Tropical Disease\" is like a mid-album docking station for your spaceship, allowing you to catch your breath before the album culminates with several unmistakeable Air songs, including the incredibly catchy \"Sing Sang Sung\", which fills the band's once-an-album quota of songs that sound like they should be heard during the opening credits of a 70's sitcom.  Air is a band that has found its niche, makes no apologies about their musical choices, and does not stray from their well-tread and highly-successful path.

{"text": "\"Still Unbroken\" is a track that was written a while ago, back when Hughie Thomasson was alive and a member or Skynyrd, but only in 2009 was it finally finalized and released, so I'm assuming that this song is one which has been thought about quite a lot and has been cultivated and perfected over an extended period of time. And it shows, too, as we now have one high quality Skynyrd track.This track is easily one of the best songs from 1991-onwards-era Skynyrd. Like many Lynyrd Skynyrd songs from the new era, this song is quite heavy, which may turn some classic-Skynyrd fans off, but it will delight hard rock fans, as it brings an enhanced power to the song's main riff, and ultimately boosts the whole track. Musically, the track can be likened to some of Black Stone Cherry's material, but with more of a classic Skynyrd flair, and less of a mainstream rock sound. Johnny Van Zant's vocals are stronger than ever, with his vocal performance complimenting the strong, heavy riffing perfectly. The soloing towards the middle is also very impressive, with Skynyrd once again utilizing the triple-guitar attack that they have at their disposal. However, good soloing, strong vocals and great guitar tones count for nothing if the songwriting is poor. Luckily this isn't the case, with the track featuring memorable riffs, a well-written chorus, several catchy hooks and some of the most inspiring lyrics you're likely to hear in rock music today. The lyrics, in fact, serve as a sort of autobiography for Lynyrd Skynyrd - despite the many years of suffering, death, hardship and pain that this band has encountered, they've managed to overcome adversity, stick together and remain unbroken while they continue to make terrific music.I urge any Skynyrd fan to listen to this. If you're a Skynyrd fan who likes a bit of hard rock (and some metal), then I'm sure you'll enjoy this track immensely. And if you're a Skynyrd fan who's a bit of a classic rock purist, then I encourage you to just open you mind and accept this different style of music, because this is a quality southern rock song that should not be missed simply because it's different to what you're used to.Long live Lynyrd Skynyrd - may the stay unbroken for many years to come._________________________________Similar tracks:Lynyrd Skynyrd - \"Through it All\"Molly Hatchet - \"Heart of the U.S.A.\"Black Stone Cherry - \"Ghost of Floyd Collins\"\n", "val": 0.044768959283828735}

{"text": "Lynyrd Skynyrd has found the total package in this song labled \"Still Unbroken\", most notably the lyrics are great, Johnny VanZant's vocals sound tremendous, and the overall sound is awesome. The story of this song runs deep and speaks of past tragedies, broken bones, and broken hearts....but the main story of the song is that you should never give up and the music lives on. After listening to this you get a sense that maybe this band has turned the corner a little bit in its attempts to record and play music that is more attractive to modern day rock radio. Somewhat little harder edge than classic Skynyrd material but still very much to its roots and fits in well. Its a nice welcome change for modern sound. Awesome Job Skynyrd.

So I was excited for this new release hoping it would at least be as good. I've listened to this new one several times through now, and it's not what I had hoped it would be. I like this band, and I do enjoy some of this CD. I get sick of reviewers who are so in love with a band that when they put out a bad album, people act like it's gold. I don't wanna do that. Here's what I DIDN'T like about Wake Up The Sleepers:The songs aren't as catchy as previous songs.There's too much swearing. It just feels like it was thrown in to make the songs seem harder. The F bomb comes up way too much.I don't want to hear the lead singer of Good Charlotte doing back up vocals on a Kill Hannah song. Mat Devine's voice is unique and sets the tone for Kill Hannah. I don't want them to sound like Good Charlotte, who quite frankly, have sucked for years now.Those are my cons. That said, Radio, New York City Speed, Strobe Lights, Why I Have My Grandma's Sad Eyes, and Mouth To Mouth are my favorite songs. Snowblinded is good, but would be better without Benji Madden's guest appearance.Sample this CD before you get it. It might not be for you. It's not what I hoped for, but I find that it grows on you over time. Kill Hannah still has a sound unique to them, and I like that about them. They're better than most everything on the radio.\n", "val": 0.0008633681572973728}

{"text": "This collection of music by the Supremes and Four Tops, that is (jean Terrell) on lead instead of (Diana) is fantastic, this release is simply a breath of frsh air.Its been years since I heard these tracks except the original Magnificient 7, since I have the cd, but the other two are glorious extensions of the first release.  If you were around in the 70's and remember the second release by these two groups \"You Got To Have Love in Your Heart\" well you have to listen to the extended version, they really let Jean Terrell let loose and boy did she turn it out, Levi who was equally impressive is left in the dust on this track.  I am so glad they let the Supremes  recombo with another male group so their talent could come forward as they did on several of the cuts such as \"reach Out and touch\" & \"you got what it takes\" where Mary & Cindy get lead lines, something that would not have been possible with Diana in the mix, and it was evident on their previous outings with Ross & the tempts (which by that time Ross was considered seperate from the girls).Memories come back to life when I hear, \"If You Could see me know\"  \"I'm glad About it\" \"Letl Make Love\"  \"Its Impossible\", Melodie, The Bigger you Love (where Jean is apparently on the backup vocals with Mary & Cindy) and especially the remix of \"river deep mt. High\" which reminds us of why this collaboration was explosive with the symphonic type opening evidently leading into the uptempo trackp.  The new unreleased bonus tracks takes some getting  used to but a track called \"Chain Reaction\" is off the hook you could always rely on Jean to deliver a good vocal and it was even sweeter with Levi sharing it with her.  I highly recommend this album inspite of the fact that they could have done a better job with the cover art, its whats inside that really count, and these grooves are on fire.

My favorites are \"River Deep, Mountain High,\" \"You've Gotta Have Love in Your Heart\" (originals and re-mixed), \"For Your Love,\" \"Hello Stranger,\" and \"If\". For those new to Motown Music it is important to note that Jean Terrell replaced Diana Ross in 1970. Although she didn't have the star power, Jean had the \"voice power\" that Diana oftened lacked. Because of the politics at Motown, Diana got the marketing and focus, and the Supremes were ignored. This album shows that Berry Gordy and Motown Music make a major mistake. Because of Jean, the post-Diana Supremes, still made hits and great music (even without Motown support). Levi Stubbs is fantastic on the album, but Jean really steals the show, exhibiting how comfortable she was in a variety of musical formats. I hope there are more Jean Terrell music in the Hippo vaults.\n", "val": 0.021086815744638443}

{"text": "It's impossible to refer to this music without first referencing the movie.I loved \"Where the Wild Things Are\" although the movie definitely has flaws. The obvious flaw (but also this is what makes the film boldly great) is that Spike Lee took a brief picturebook and stretched it into a lengthy and emotional story. The movie is beautiful, poignant and extremely artistic.As artistic is the movie so is the accompanying music. The film is complicated yet childish, surrealistic yet gritty, touching and scary. A thumping soundtrack with commercial songs would ruin the very unique vibe that is created.What I am trying to say is that these tunes fare much better when playing with the film then on their own. The songs are very quirky, sparse, eccentric and touch upon child's music...which it should. Karen O of the Yea, Yea Yeas is the main artist with many notable contributors. They perfectly reflect the [perceived] vision of the director.I feel that the only song that fits the category of accessibility outside of the film is \"All is Well\" which is a beautiful yet conventional song. If you saw the movie then these songs will mean something. If you haven't, don't bother with this material.\n", "val": 0.009716171771287918}

Although I'm of course familiar with the book Where the Wild Things Are (what parent of a toddler isn't?) I haven't seen the film yet (I think my son is still a little too young for it).  But you don't need to have seen the film to appreciate how cool this soundtrack is.  I think these songs seem to represent many of the emotions of childhood: from low-key happy contentment (Igloo) through love (All is Love), defiance (Capsize), melancholy (Worried Shoes), and the pure joy of running wild (Rumpus), this music captures it all.  It's mostly kids singing along with Karen O (whom I hadn't even heard of before).  It's true this isn't the typical Disney kids' soundtrack most of us are used to by now, and hey I like Disney tracks like the stuff from The Jungle Book etc. as much as the next grown-up kid, but this isn't supposed to be that.  Heck, I've listened to this soundtrack many times already and still can't figure out half the words, but it doesn't matter cause the music is fun to listen to.  It's not the first music I'd reach for for a sing-along, but it's perfect music to have playing in the background if you kid likes to listen to music while he is playing, with you or by himself.  I love peeking in on my little guy and watching him bop around and try to sing \"All is Love\" or any of these songs when he thinks nobody is looking.

{"text": "I saw the movie of WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE when it came out in theatres in October 2009.  I thought the film was a solid adaptation and expansion that remained true to the spirit of the original story by Maurice Sendak.  There are some very impressive visuals in the movie, but for me the thing I remembered most was the music.  The movie soundtrack features original (mostly) songs by Karen O and the Kids.  Before seeing the movie, I had never heard of Karen O, but apparently she's the lead vocalist for a band called the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and I might check out some of their work now because I was so impressed by her vocals on WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE.  The tracks on this album are a perfect compliment to the film. The songs capture the vibrant enthusiasm, youthful energy, and childlike questioning that is at the heart of the tone and mood of the movie.  I have some favorite tracks on the album, including \"Igloo\", \"All Is Love\", \"Capsize\", \"Building All Is Love\", and \"Sailing Home\".  However, all of the songs flow quite well together; they're more akin to movements than separate pieces, and you can listen to the entire album without realizing that you've heard 14 different tunes. Children, especially those who have seen the film, will probably enjoy the album, but there's a lot here that adults will appreciate perhaps even more.\n", "val": 0.04026744142174721}

The perfect scene for the Wild Things worried world. Inspite of childhood years in similar T-tree underbrush I'd never transposed Sendak's tale to these environs. The film clearly thrilled my daughter, as it would have me at her age. But its the soundtrack that remains playing between my ears.

{"text": "2009 turned out to be quite the year for Karen O (singer for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs): earlier in the year the YYYs released their most successful album to date (the outstanding \"It's Blitz!\"), and in late September the soundtrack to \"Where the Wild Things Are\" was released as \"original songs by Karen O and the Kids\". I didn't want to pick this up until I had had an opportunity to see the movie, which I finally did over the year-end holidays.\"Where The Wild Things Are\" (14 tracks; 40 min.) brings a collage of songs and sounds featured in the movie, some instrumentals, some with vocals, some short, some longer, it's all over the place (and this is not a complaint, mind you). This is not \"music inspired by\", no, it's the actual songs used in the movie (well, all-but-one: \"Capsize\" was not in the movie). As to who \"the Kids\" are, Karen O. calls on her YYYs bandmates Brian Chase and Nick Zinner, as well as Deerhunter's Bradford Cox, among others, and then there are of course a bunch of singing kids of many of the songs. If you've seen the movie, you know the songs are free-flowing, mostly folksy but joyous, if not boisterous and it just all flows together so well. \"All Is Love\" was released as a radio single, and as such can be termed the \"must-listen\" track on here, but truth be told, this soundtrack is an \"ensemble\" listening experience in which no track is better or worse than the next one. The 40 min. zip by in no time, and you really won't remember if you're on track 7 or 10 or such thing.This soundtrack isn't meant for the masses, to be honest. It's a slightly off-center soundtrack to a slightly off-center movie, albeit in the most delightful way. And a TRUE soundtrack, in tune with the mood of the movie (one might even argue it partly creates the mood of the movie). I absolutely love this soundtrack. Finally, if you wonder where you can actually hear this, check out WOXY (BAM!

{"text": "\"Hi,\" softly whisperes Max.\"I could use a story,\" answers his mother.Thus begins the soundtrack to the highly anticipated release of the much beloved children's classic, 'Where The Wild Things Are.' Fortunately for us, the film is in good hands (Spike Jonze), and luckily, the soundtrack is in the hands of Karen O (of Yeah Yeah Yeahs)and The Kids. The result is a smartly composed fourteen track dream that successfully manages to capture and blend clever child-like tunes (kid choir and all) and sweetly crafted mature pop songs for those adults with an indie flare. Fear not. 'Where The Wild Things Are' ranks among the best soundtracks. It's stands confidently alongside Aimee Mann's 'Magnolia.'Charming, fun, and yes, quite adorable, 'WTWTA' boasts some endearing tracks. The obvious standout is 'All is Love.' With live children backing up Karen O (who sounds much like a kid herself), \"L-O-V-E, it's a mystrey,\" never sounded so sweet. However, 'Worried Shoes' is a surprise heart-tugger as well. It's a wonderful and much welcome cover of Daniel Johnston's original. 'Capsize,' which doesn't appear in the film, is mysterious, almost tribal-like, and wild, which I suppose is quite appropriate. And who could forget 'Igloo' with it lovely humming accompanied by acoustics and twinkles? I haven't.

Secondly, every other band these days are keeping the \"brand\" name of the band without there being but one or two original members in the band so to criticize Skynyrd over that is kinda pointless.Either you like the new Skynyrd or you don't. I personally feel like it's pretty decent. I guess the best way I can put it is that it's totally worth $2.99 but I probably would never spend $9.99 on it.The sound is definitely that of southern rock/country and I would say it even tends to lean towards country quite a bit more than maybe what this current lineup is used to even though I haven't heard all of their newer stuff. Is it better than old Skynyrd? Of course not! The old Skynyrd was LEGENDARY. This version of Skynyrd is just pretty good.Nothing too special but to me they are more of just a tribute to the original. It's the closest thing we'll get in 2009 and I am totally OK with them carrying on the name as they do.If there was one negative I would say about this album it is that it sounds a little overproduced especially on the vocals. It might be, though, that Johnny Van Zant actually sounds that way and it's just my ears so I dunno.To me, \"God & Guns\" sounds kind of in the vein of Nickelback were they to do a more country-tinged album. I wasn't alive when Skynyrd was big (born in '82) but I grew up on their songs as my parents always had them playing and I love their back catalogue. This is my first time buying a Skynyrd album from the new line-up and I have to say I was somewhat impressed. The best songs are: \"Still Unbroken\", \"Southern Ways\", \"Floyd\", \"That Ain't My America\" and \"God & Guns\".My advice: Go ahead and spend the $2.99 on it while you can because it's ALMOST a steal!\n", "val": 0.0061522722244262695}

{"text": "So, as one reviewer already said, you may not know most of the performers on this great collection; some names you will recognize.  It makes no difference as all of these performances are very, very good indeed!  Much of this music I am familiar with, but I have to say, that there is an intimacy to most of these recordings that makes me feel as if I am sitting very close to the musicians.  I am hearing notes, instruments, and inflection that I've missed in other very well known recordings.  So, whether you're new to this grand composer and want a thorough collection of his music, or if you are very well versed with multiple renditions, you will be pleased with the few dollars invested.Thank you, Amazon, for making quality music possible in hard economic times.  Music that is uplifting and centering.  Even when I can shop other places, I come to you because you are kind enough to do such great things like this for your customers. And, one good turn always deserves another.  Bravo Vivaldi!  Bravo Amazon!\n", "val": 0.04666142538189888}
{"text": "This collection is a real breakthrough for Amazon and the X5 music group, which offers these collections of bargain MP3s of classical music.Like previous collections, this Vivaldi set puts together a strong roster of lesser-known players, often (but not only) lesser-known ensembles from Eastern Europe who still offer really nice performances.A huge change, and a tremendously welcome one, is that complete works are offered! Until now, all these sets have just slapped together stray movements of pieces out of order. This one offers cohesive works in their entirety, from beginning to end.If they could now go back to Beethoven and start over using this Vivaldi set as a model, that would be fantastic.At the $2.99 \"Deal of the Day\" price on Oct 30, 2009, this is a great bargain.

{"text": "Many of the reviewers of this set rate it base on the incredible value of getting most of Bruckner's symphonies at a great price.  This is true.  Eight symphonies for less than six bucks is unbeatable. Five stars.Others note the quality of the recordings.  These are 80's era recordings, and these sound like it--but not quite as good as the major labels (like London or DG). Four stars.Then there are the performances.  Some are quite good in their own right.  The only ones I found disappointing are 3 and 4 (some of the brass is not quite in tune in a few places and sometimes a bit strident).  Still not as good as most world class orchestras (comparing with my versions by Chicago, RSO Berlin, Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic).  Still, better than many of the offerings found on those \"99/100 Masterpieces\" collections you can find on other great composers.  Four Stars**note that recording quality and performances go together, and if you are not listening on a good home stereo, you might not find any issues with recording/performance quality.  I noticed a difference mostly with Symphony no. 4 when I compared it with my CD by CSO/Solti on my home system, but find it less troublesome when listening with headphones on my computer.Also, be aware that the first recording you get of Bruckner will often set the standard and you will compare every additional recording with it.  Hence my problems with the 4th, as I am familiar with every note and nuance from my previously mentioned recording.For those who love Bruckner, they may find the best reason for getting this album is the editions used for the 3rd and 4th symphonies (and maybe the 7th).  Not your standard editions (Schalk and Mahler, respectively).  Here are the editions as best as I can tell (might be wrong on some of these, not being an expert).0 - 1869 Nowak3 - 1890 revision by Bruckner with the Schalks (interesting)4 - 1888 Mahler shortened and changed some of the orchestration.  This may be the only recording you can find of this edition.5 - 1878 Nowak6 - 1881 Nowak7 - not sure, but one of the best recordings of the lot.8 - 1887/1890 mixed versions edited by Haas9 - 1894 Nowak, without the reconstruction of the final movement (I think Rozhdestvenski recorded it, though).I compared the timings with abruckner.com's discography to determine this.Summary:  It's worth the price.  The more I listen, the more I appreciate these performances.  You will too, whether rounding out your Bruckner collection or just beginning one.\n", "val": 9.781166590983048e-05}
{"text": "This is a great bargain! I have listened to a good number of Bruckner symphony cycles (Karajan, Wand, Furtwangler, Paternostro) and this is an EXCELLENT ONE! There are nine symphonies included in this mp3 download. Numbers 1 and 2 were not included, unfortunately! But that does not stop this from being THE BEST deal in Bruckner symphonies available. I haven't heard a brass section sound this crisp, bright and with such incredible intonation anywhere. This is not hyperbole. Try it for yourself. This is gorgeous music, full of life and recorded with modern equipment which gives it a living sound that is perhaps unmatched by the greats of years gone past. Rozhdestvensky and the Russian Capella Symphony have given us a  gift and at this price it is affordable to all! This music is available at an unbeatable cost and could easily be burned to CD if necessary. If you are looking for a first Bruckner experience, look no further. If you have heard every Bruckner cycle out there... well, you haven't heard this one! Go for it, you will be very glad you did!\n", "val": 0.027809537947177887}
{"text": "For those who are unfamiliar with the music of Anton Bruckner; he was a funny looking guy with a Curly Howard haircut who lived in Austria during the 19th century. Although he composed much choral music for the church, he is best known for his eleven symphonies, #1-9, and also Symphony #0 and #00. All of these symphonies are incredibly long like Beethoven's 9th or the symphonies of Gustav Mahler. Like Mahler's symphonies, the Bruckner symphonies are also big and brassy; very lush and bombastic.In this collection, you get #0 \"The Zeroth\"; #3 \"The Wagner\": #4 \"Romantic\"; #5 \"Tragic\"; #6 \"The Philosophical\"; #7 \"Lyric\"; #8 \"The Apocalypse\" and #9 \"To God, the Beloved\".The Bruckner symphonies are all reflections of Bruckner's faith in God. He was a devout Roman Catholic. The music is meant to evoke big forests, powerful hills and mountains, and the sunlight bursting through the clouds. At face value, it may seem that Bruckner composed the same symphony eleven times; and in a way he did. Indeed, each symphony is pretty much built on the same formula: a rousing but tense first movement; a waltz-like or march-like second; a lyrical and slow third movement; and a very grand and triumphant finale for the fourth movement. Sometimes the order of second and third movements are reversed; and the Ninth is a departure in that it was unfinished and lacks a finale.For a person who is new to classical music, these symphonies can be challenging. It may seem as if it's eternal bombast, and there are patchy or flabby parts where Bruckner seems to not quite know how to get from point A to point B. Even so, there are so many truly beautiful moments within the layers of bombast and plushness, that with some effort, it can be a very rewarding experience.I would suggest taking each symphony one at a time. I have found that the symphonies only make sense after several hearings. I would start with Symphony #3, #4, #7 or #9. Symphony #3 is a big, noisy, wooly mammoth of a symphony. It's dedicated to Richard Wagner and captures the master's sweeping drive. Symphony #4 is also quite grand in the late Romantic fashion; though a bit more subdued than the third, but certainly not lacking in power. Symphony #7 is also attractive because of some nice melodies, hence the subtitle, \"Lyric\". The Symphony #9 is probably the best of the lot; the middle movement is a thunderous march sandwhiched between two very moving and reflective outer movements.While the Symphony #8 has a lovely slow movement, it can be difficult because of it's sprawling length; though it's very nice once you get used to it. Indeed, the 8th is an epic that culminates in a startling portrait of \"Judgement Day\". The Symphony #6 is also quite nice, but I never liked it as much as some of the others. I've always found the Symphony #5 to be difficult with not much to sieze upon. Likewise the Symphony #0 doesn't sound as inspired as the others and even Bruckner crowned it \"Number Zero\" as he didn't quite like it himself.As for the performances; I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this collection. As far as I know, the Russian conductor, Gennady Rozhdestvensky is not particularly known as a conductor of Bruckner; nor do Russian orchestras stand out for this music which is usually associated Viennese or German conductors and orchestras. Be that as it may; Rozhdestvensky and this Russian State Orchestra are as solid as a rock. The more quiet or slow passages are played with tenderness and feeling; and the louder, triumphant and thunderous parts are played with awesome power.While you could spend upwards of $50-70 buying each symphony individually or buying a box set, I say to spare yourself the financial burden and go with this set for less than $6.I've never identified myself as much a Brucknerphile, but this collection may make a believer out of me.Comparisons: #3 (Kublenik); #4 (Ormandy); #8 (Karajan); #9 (Bernstein/Vienna Phil; Walter)\n", "val": 0.008569260127842426}
{"text": "Because I have long been a fan of Anton Bruckner, when I saw the Amazon offer, I checked it out.  Here are Bruckner's Sym 0 + (3 + 4?) + 5 - 9 by an orchestra and conductor with which I am not familiar.  The sample clips sounded satisfactory so I went for the offer.  Here is how I rated the mp3 tracks:Conductor's interpretation:  Remarkably individual in a style interpretive of Bruckner's intent (I can't authenticate this claim, but the music has an honest and exciting sound).  For example, the recording of the 7th, with which I have considerable experience, was alive and mysteriously vivacious in a manner that made me feel as though I were hearing it for the first time.Orchestra's performance:  Excellent!  They have put their soul into this performance, evidently immersing themselves into his music until the orchestra and conductor were satisfied.Recording quality:  Excellent!  The acoustics of the concert hall were perfect for the works, live but not echoey, and placement and quality of the microphones was expertly done.  No distortion, no extraneous noise and really flat frequency response.The only problem I had was that the 3rd and 4th symphonies didn't get downloaded, but it is not clear to me at this point if they were part of the package.  Maybe someone can clarify this.Also, be advised that the download takes a long time.  3 1/2 hours for the tracks to be copied to my computer, but my inet connection only runs at about 65KB/sec.\n", "val": 0.007532726041972637}

Mariah keeps the melody simple on this one, allowing the listener to focus on her vunerable vocals as she asks the quesition: What is love?  Mariah begins the first verse with a subtle whisper like vocal, leading into the 2nd and final parts of the song, where she belts beautifully at the top of her lungs amongst a background of a gospel choir singing the wonderful chorus to this classic.

She has had a lot of weak cover songs that she has done over the years, from a lackluster cover of Journey's Open Arms, to a mixed cover of Brenda K. Starr's I Still Believe. While her best cover was of The Jackson 5's I'll Be There, she still needs to really deliver. With her latest single, a cover of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is, the second single from her latest album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, she honestly has not done that. The song was absolutely a very weak and less than strong cover for a few reasons. One of them is that she missed recording an entire verse of the song from when Foreigner did it 25 years ago, and the second is that it missed the heart and soul that had been made from the song for years. Next to when Wynonna Judd covered the song a few years ago, this honestly has to be the least-enjoyed version of the Foreigner classic. I thought this was not a good idea for it to be a single from the album, and I was right. Better luck with Memoirs, Mariah.

The first track is a new song which is an absolutely amazing up-beat song perfect for the Christmas season.  The sisters do a funny rendition of the \"Chipmunks Christmas Song\" that is great indeed!  My other favorite is the sisters singing \"Oh Come Emannuel\" the harmonies,,, as always are tight!!!!  I'm surprised that so few people I knew realized that this CD was coming out and available.  Take it from me; you won't regret making this purchase.\n", "val": 0.04572562873363495}

{"text": "This c.d is just awesome! The Clark Sisters are truly amazing and to be able to listen to them during the holiday season is going to be wonderful.Celebration-What a great way to open the c.d and for that matter the Christmas and holiday season. It's a great upbeat song which showcases all of the sisters on lead. Will become a new holiday classic.Silver Bells-Very pretty and simple, even has Kierra Sheard singing a few lines. Nice arrangment on a traditional song.O come Emmanuel-In my opinion the best song on the c.d, gives me chills. It's beautifully arranged, and the harmony is nearly perfect. The humming close to the end of the song is gorgeous, and show the sisters at their best playing off of each other, without overpowering each other or getting of key. Very pretty.Silent Night-Jacky Clark Chisolm leads this holiday staple, and does a great job.We are the Reason-Features Bill Moss Jr. on lead. Very powerful song with beautiful background choir. His voice is smooth but strong, and he blends very well with the choir. Very nice.Hark the Herald Angels Sing-Karen and Kierra! What more can I say. Very very pretty. At times you can't tell one from the other. What is great about this song is that it's somewhat subtle. I have to say I believe Karen Clark Sheard is at her best on songs like this when she just shows the prettiness and smoothness of her voice. They are both powerhouse singers, and definitely show ability on the song, but it's not over the top, just soft and beautiful very heartfelt.This Christmas-The Donny Hathaway classic is covered nicely by J.Moss, who I consider to be the male version of Karen Clark Sheard. J definitely takes it to church at the end which was an unexpected surprise. He's urging everyone to remember the real reason for the season Jesus Christ!Beautiful Christmas-Here Kierra Sheard does well on this new holiday song. It speaks of family coming together. Gets you in the holiday spirit.Chipmunk Song-These ladies are just awesome! This is actually one of my favorite songs on the c.d. Even when they are having fun they're on point. To top it off they end it with a C.O.G.I.C yes! You've got to hear this!Do you hear what I hear-Once again can't go wrong here nicely doneDrummer Boy-has a lenghthy interlude, but is still nice, and when the ladies use their gifts at the end of the song,priceless!Overall excellent c.d. You can listen to every single song. Great Job once again Clark sisters\n", "val": 0.04985610395669937}
{"text": "These are not the first Christmas songs (or even the first holiday album) released by The Clark Sisters, but wow, how they sing these songs so well! Their 1990 album simply entitled \"Christmas\" is out of print indefinitely; so this CD is the way to go at least for now if you want holiday tunes from these wonderful ladies. This is truly high quality control music and anyone who likes holiday music is bound to love this album. The Clark Sisters sound terrific and they always harmonize to perfection--and beyond! I really like the very good sound quality and the artwork is very nicely done.Several tracks really stand out in my mind. \"Celebration\" is a most upbeat, infectiously happy tune that starts the album with a whole lot of POW! \"Silver Bells\" gets a fine treatment even though the tempo is faster than I'm used to hearing--it still holds its own very well and I'm impressed. The music fits perfectly with their vocals and that's terrific. In addition, listen for a passionate \"Silent Night\" with a gospel accent that works so well--wonderful!\"Hark The Herald Angels Sing;\" \"This Christmas;\" \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" are all splendid; and there's even a cute, fun rendition of \"The Chipmunk Song\" thrown in for a good effect. The album ends very well with The Clark Sisters performing \"Drummer Boy.\"Judging by the audience reaction, The Clark Sisters outdid even themselves on this album full of excellent holiday music. This is great for any fan of The Clark Sisters and even people just discovering them would do well to add this to their music collection.\n", "val": 0.05071621015667915}

{"text": "At first I was bummed to hear this was a cover, but I feel like Kris injects new life into this Script song. The original vocals by The Script sound like Adam Levine (from Maroon 5) and Kris's voice sounds distinct on this take. I also like that he didn't go the traditional route and release a power ballad or something safe. Instead, he went with a wordy, upbeat song that he usually doesn't do and it shows that Kris likes to take risks as an artist. The song is perfect for those moments when you're driving with the windows open and the wind blowing in your hair - it's just a feelgood, anthemic song that you can't go wrong with. People who are not fans of Idol will appreciate it, and Kris Allen fans will adore it, because the song still showcases Kris's laid-back vibe and impeccable phrasing, while also posing a bit of a challenge for Kris since it is a cover as well as an up-tempo, wordy song.

{"text": "So this song was originally recorded by the band \"The Script\"...and unfortunately, you can tell. I don't say this because I don't like The Script or Kris Allen, I say this because the minute the music starts and the vocals begin, all I'm hearing is a poor man's The Script and not a stellar Kris Allen. He sounds like he's trying to imitate instead of grasp and own his own style. He had to do that on Idol while performing other people's songs...now should be his time to show who HE really is. I really wish the producers of A.I. would give these people more room to spread their wings and not try to reel in money by making them carbon copies of what's already on the music scene. I find songs like this distract me from the talent that originally shined through when Kris 1st hit the stage. I would have much rather heard this song on the radio waves being preformed by The Script and a different song being done by Mr. Allen.I don't hate the single, but I don't love it either. Recognize this review for what it is: A plea to the music industry (And A.I.) to allow these guys to win then make GOOD music, not watered down versions of already established bands in order to make a quick buck off us music lovers.

I had never heard of the Irish band, The Script, before Kris released this song. I heard that the song was previously only released as a B side in Germany. This is great music with a great message.

It is deceptively simple, deceptively because the guitar work is highly complex behind that initial basic chord progression, and the song structure is progressive rock with time signature changes in abundance.

Meaghan Smith has a beautiful, smooth, emotion-laden voice with more than just a hint of 'twenties' styling. The music is varied, but much of it brings to mind 20's, 30's, and 40's music, for which her voice is perfect. There is a bit of big-band swing style. There are some tearjerker ballads. There are some 'sassy' sounding twenties flapper moments. A bit of folk. Old-time country-western boogie-woogie. Showtune-like songs. Even a little funny at times. As I said, quite varied. Impressive!However, if you are into the 'modern' canned electronic drone (or remix sound) that nearly every popular female vocalist does these days, forget it. It's not on here (thank God). It's very organic and natural music. Beautifully written and orchestrated pieces. This CD will often take you on a journey to yesteryear. If you haven't been exposed to yesteryear, this is a great place to start--it should be a very refreshing change from what's on the radio these days. It's a mix of updated 20's - 40's sounds and more modern forms and ballads. There is no filler here; all great stuff. If music really touches you, she'll bring tears to your eyes at times...

Between the dog walking around and his parents needing to get things done in the evenings, it was just too loud. I tried a number of white noise tracks and most were just too whooshing - they didn't sound soothing. This is the best we've found. It has a steady sound, and is an hour long all on one track, so it doesn't repeat constantly like the 2-3 minute versions do.It does lose 1 star due to the fade in and fade out effects at the beginning and end of the track.

If nothing else, it drowns out other sounds better (creaking floor, shuffling items, etc.).  I'm hesitant to say it definitely works because at the same time we implemented the white noise, he was also getting better after being sick almost two months straight with several bad daycare colds.  He would have slept better regardless simply because he can breath again!\n", "val": 0.00016534558380953968}

Also, the track fades in and out. It's a very long fade & sometimes she will wake up when it's super quiet/silent before the track starts again.

{"text": "Disclaimer:  This review is based on a comparison with the most popular violin-based hip hop/pop/R&b violinist, Miri Ben Ari.  These two (Ari and Davis) should be recognized as the top in their fusion genre of music, with Ari being regarded as the most popular due to her major label success and Grammy awards.I understand that Daniel sites Miri Ben Ari as one of his influences, but he has blown her debut release away with this!  Although it should be said that her violin-based hip hop CD is focused on a different genre (where Ari's release is hip hop and Davis' release is neo-soul), what makes Daniel's music much more spectacular is that the \"voice\" of his violin did not get lost in over-production.  When I first heard Daniel's promo CDs and live appearances, I remember thinking, \"This guy's taste for fusing mainstream hip hop/R&B with classical violin is right up there with Miri Ben Ari's performances.\"  The difference between then and now is while they both made their name with classical violin renditions of popular songs... their original compositions are the true measures of their musicianship.  I do not blame Miri Ben Ari for putting out a less-than-expected debut.  I understand that with major label backing , they are in search of music they can market to the masses.  Well, what the listeners received in return was a CD by Ari that feels more like her violin should be in the production liner notes.  Her violin just did not seem like the focus of the music.  Let me say this now:  DANIEL DAVIS' VIOLIN IS THE HEART, SOUL, AND VOICE OF THIS CD.  It drives it.  He does not come off as just a contributor to the instrumentation.  HE IS THE FOCUS... and still the music retains its up-to-date hip hop/R&B sound despite the classical violin taking lead.  Just listen to the previews of both artists.  Who gets lost in over-production+vocals, and who shines through?I hope and pray that if/when he finds Mainstream or Top 40 success, it does not come at the cost of his musicianship... or at the cost of the \"voice\" of his violin.  THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY SUPERB R&B DEBUT.\n", "val": 0.007693322375416756}

{"text": "Until this album, the recordings of Tunisian oudist Anouar Brahem have not interested me, mainly because of the typical subdued, almost minimal ECM sound. I prefer more lively oud taqasim and Western-like improvisations. In \"The Astounding Eyes of Rita,\" Brahem is teamed with three other musicians (Blaus Gesing, Bjrn Meyer, and Khaled Yassine, playing bass clarinet, bass viol, and bendir and darbouka drums, and the mood is brighter. The rich interplay among the musicians is very fine. The result is an album of quiet beauty, yearning, and fond remembrance. There is a sweetness in this ensemble's music. The album can be compared to those with jazz Lebanese oudist Rabih Abou-Khalil, also produced by ECM's Manfred Eicher, but Brahem's music dances more lightly. A recasting of the classical Arab takht ensemble into a contemporary jazz group, this lovely and memorable album offers great listening for world music and jazz fan alike.\n", "val": 0.036758869886398315}

The Astounding Eyes of Rita continues his stream of wildly diverse releases, this time with a new ensemble that again melds European instruments and sensibility with North African traditional instruments and harmonic ideas.On this album, there is a unique combination of lower-register instruments -- the oud, contrabass and bass clarinet together occupy a fairly narrow band and reinforce each other.  There are more dynamic rhythmic ideas here than on Brahem's last two (superb) albums of Islamo-European art music; those records were slow, dreamy and impressionistic.  The Astounding Eyes of Rita has a livelier pulse.The album is also superbly recorded.  One of Brahem's best!\n", "val": 0.04049940034747124}
{"text": "Anouar Brahem's latest addition to the ECM catalog continues his evolution from a proficient but traditional Arabic musician to a true impresario and innovative chamber musician.  In \"The Astounding Eyes of Rita,\" Brahem continues the seamless melding of Arabic music, improvisatory jazz, and classical music present in his past few albums on ECM.\"Rita\"'s ensemble is a departure from the hauntingly beautiful trio that he employed for his past two albums, \"Le Pas du Chat Noir\" and \"Les Voyage du Sahar,\" and while this reviewer misses the intimations of the accordion and piano in combination with Brahem's oud, the musicians in this quartet nonetheless impart their own brilliance to Brahem's compositions.  Klaus Gesing's bass clarinet here brings to mind Brahem's collaboration with Dave Holland in \"Thimar,\" but without the at times strident tone present in Holland's soprano saxophone.  The bass clarinet, with its smoky, rich timbre, and the addition of the percussion adds just enough pop to make the mixture nearly transcendent.The music itself is a excellent mixture of the beautiful and the bold.  Simultaneously ethereal and earth, this is music that is evokes the outdoors, but is well at home in the concert hall.  Brahem's oud wanders in and out of the compositions like an immigrant, and the talent of his surrounding cast make for a seamless musical whole.  While this reviewer hopes for a reunion of the Matinier and Couturier collaborations in the near future, this album makes for a wonderful introduction to Brahem's for the uninitiated and a worthy addition to the ECM catalog for those familiar with his work.While his roots are undoubtedly in the music of his Tunisian homeland he has clearly absorbed the best part of his French classical education.  The result puts him up there with Bela Fleck, Zakir Hussain, and other extraordinarily talented musicians that find themselves not only at home, but thriving in multiple musical genres.\n", "val": 0.02465699426829815}

{"text": "This is simply incredibly beautiful music.  Never mind the genre labels (it's ECM after all) - there are elements of jazz, Arabic music and classical chamber music contained here...but most of all, this is at its heart music from the human soul, and Anouar Brahem's most personal recording in several years...maybe ever.  I say `personal' because on this recording you can hear Anouar voicing melodic lines along with his oud playing - not overbearing, not loud, not singing words...but quietly, gently, underscoring the deep source of these pieces.  The original music is the voice, after all.Anouar is accompanied here by three wonderful, sensitive performers - Klaus Gesing (bass clarinet), Bjrn Meyer (bass, from Nik Brtsch's Ronin) and Khaled Yassine (darbouka, bender).  The four players blend seamlessly into the musical streams that Brahem has composed for this release - they send forth sinuous lines that parallel one moment and intertwine in delicate harmony and counterpoint and rhythm the next.  There's not a weak track in the lot - it's one of those discs I know I'll be playing multiple times at each sitting.Stylistically, the music here falls somewhere between Brahem's last albums (such as the achingly lovely LE PAS DU CHAT NOIR (2002) and THIMAR (1998), with echoes of the more traditionally Arabic music of his early releases tossed into the mix.  It's an incredible recording - a good place to start experiencing his work for those who have never heard him, and an essential addition to the collection of those who are already fans.\n", "val": 0.037215571850538254}

{"text": "Released in 2009, THE ASTOUNDING EYES OF RITA was Tunisian oudist Anouar Brahem's tenth album for ECM. He is accompanied here by Klaus Gesing (bass clarinet), Bjrn Meyer (bass) and Khaled Yassine (darbouka, bender). The album sees him stepping back a bit from the \"Parisian caf music\" of his previous couple of albums, often returning to the Arab inflections and ambient film score sounds of his early ECM career. Meyer and Yassine always remain in the background, but Gesing takes the spotlight almost as much as Brahem.Yes, this album is all very nice and pretty, but as someone who has followed Brahem's discography to date, THE ASTOUNDING EYES OF RITA is quite disappointing. One would have expected younger musicians like Gesing and Meyer to re-energize Brahem and push him in bold new directions, but instead they just accompany him in the rut that he now appears to be stuck in. It's not just that Brahem is retreading music of the past, but he's now doing so without any of the fire that enlivened some of his great albums of the 1990s.If you've never heard Brahem's work before, start with his very first ECM release&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Barzakh/dp/B000025XP1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Barzakh</a>&nbsp;and work your way forward from there.

I liked and bought that as well as other Brahem recordings in the succeeding years. But I hadn't thought of him recently until I read several very positive reviews of The Astounding Eyes of Rita in the music press.Like other Anouar Brahem recordings I own, this one is intensely relaxing. While it isn't the best Brahem recording I own, there are a few very good atmospheric pieces here. The best one in my opinion is definitely the title cut. But there are also a couple of others that rank with some of the best that Brahem has recorded. Those are The Lover of Beirut and Galilee Mon Amour.As usual with ECM recordings, this CD comes very tastefully packaged and is accompanied by an attractive yet almost spartan booklet containing pictures, album info, and a poem by the late poet Mahmoud Darwish that quite possibly inspired the name of the album and to whom it is dedicated.

{"text": "The Astounding Eyes of Rita has got to be one of the most beautiful recordings of acoustic instrumental music I've heard in my life!  I've had the CD now for over three weeks and since it's been in my possession I've listened to little else.  I compare \"...Rita\" with Shakti's Natural Elements and the David Grisman Quintet (first recording).  This is instrumental music of an incredibly high caliber, and yet to write that doesn't do justice to the haunting quality of the music.  Though I compared them favorably with the aforementioned groups, Anouar Brahem's ensemble burns with a quiet fire; make no mistake there is muscularity to this music but it is sinew of an ethereal matrix.Honestly, I don't know how to stop listening to it.  Each time I think I should unplug from it before I burn out on it another week has gone by and I'm still immersed in it, and I have 36 days of music on my ipod.  Part of the reason could be that I'm a musician and Brahem's muse is just so enchanting.  I find it impossible to listen to this album as background music.  More than once I've had visitors who had a hard time engaging me if \"...Rita\" was playing.My favorite pieces are Stopover at Djibouti, Al Birwa, Galilee Mon Amour, and of course the title track.

{"text": "One of the great joys of being Anouar Brahem fan is that you can always regard any upcoming album of his as a \"must buy\" no matter what instrumentalists he's collaborating with.  If I knew his next album was a collaboration with a bagpipe player, a trombonist, and a beat-box player - I'd still buy it.  Brahem is devoted to detailing a beautiful melody with precision and contemplation, and the players on his albums all use minimal instrumentation to maximum effect.  Modulation is never taken for modulation's sake - which is not something that can be said for many, many jazz artists.On \"The Astounding Eyes of Rita\", Brahem and his group continue developing a music firmly in between jazz and chamber music.  Perhaps this album is a bit more jazz than chamber music - unlike the last two albums, but like \"Thimar\"... and yet, this album feels very different from \"Thimar\"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Thimar/dp/B000024ZYP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Thimar</a>&nbsp;in that it has an even stronger ensemble feel than that album.  Let me just walk you through this beautiful album.The opening track, \"The Lover of Beirut,\" is a langorous track beginning and ending with what I can only describe as a chime on the guitar.  The oud and clarinet play in unison, tracing out a typical Brahem Easternish melody with exquisite care.  \"Dance with Waves\" is a short jazz track making good use of the bass player, and a perfect blend of the sanguine and the phlegmatic moods that characterize this album.  \"Stopover at Djibouti\" is one of my favorite pieces.  It's very light on its feet and its simple but quick tune is so sunny that it feels miles away from most everything on \"Le Pas du Chat Noir\".  There is a moment in the middle when the clarinet cuts out, the opening guitar chime returns, and the clarinet softly returns in a high register with a delicate phrase - it is true beauty.  \"The Astounding Eyes of Rita\" (the title track) starts with a pensive oud solo (accompanied with minimal wordless vocals by Brahem), but then shifts to a sauntering quasi-bossa nova rhythm (Rita?).  It is a more melancholic piece but exhibits the virtuosity and emotional maturity we've come to expect from Brahem and his players.  \"Galilee Mon Amour\" is likewise a rather melancholy piece built on an unusual rhythm and some great drum playing, not as interesting to me as the title track, but still excellent, interesting music.\"Waking State\" is a slow piece with some beautiful oud playing (in unison with clarinet at times) over held tones from the guitar (clarinet later).  Thinking about the title of the song, I'm left with the impression of the pondering you might do when you wake up but you don't have to be anywhere very soon.  \"For No Apparent Reason\" returns the album to a sanguine mood with some clever interactive playing among the musicians.\n", "val": 0.023674095049500465}

{"text": "When 'Halloween 2' - the sequel to the low-budget horror film that set box office records for that genre - was being created, John Carpenter turned over the director's chair to Rick Rosenthal and concentrated on screenwriting, production & music composition (with Alan Howarth). The results of that effort were a major component of this film's and the previous one's box-office success, particularly John Carpenter's 2-toned 'Michael Myers', or 'Halloween', theme. Having owned the original Varese Sarabande CD release, I find it compares quite well.Carpenter & Howarth, who went on to score 'Prince of Darkness' and 2 more 'Halloween' films, create a claustrophobic, creepy score using largely keyboards, piano & synthesizers. It's most noticeable in 'Still He Kills', a compilation of sorts in which the music from each of Myers' nasty homicides. The most chilling is the one used when he scalds/drowns Karen the nurse in a hydrotherapy pool - sharp, blasting synthesizer tones as the film shows the temperature rising. 'Operating Room' uses a rapid-paced synthesizer to depict the flooding of the room with oxygen & gases, then an ominous low tone as Loomis ignites a lighter, incinerating Michael Myers & badly injuring himself. Themes from the first film are prevalent throughout; most notable is 'Laurie's Theme', which is heard in 'Michael's Sister?', 'Mrs. Alves', and 'Laurie & Jimmy'. An interesting addition to the album is a collection of 'Halloween 2 Suites', consisting of cues drawn together from the soundtrack and merged together, sometimes overlapping, in the way they appeared in the film.Nice to hear this great, chilling soundtrack for the second entry in the Michael Myers story.

I bought this Re-Issue album on C.D. which is limited to 1000 units from buysoundtrax in hopes that the added bonus tracks were to complete the rest of the score, however there's only a certain score added that wasn't on the 1st pressing, I believe in track 14 or 15 and that's the score where in the scene, the nurse gets the syringe injected into her brain by Michael. The rest of the \"Suites\" are just most of the same score in tracks 1-11 all mixed together in montages. Kind of disappointing. Also a note on the production of the audio quality. Yes it has been Amplified which sounds a lot more clearer from the 1990 version. However it sounds particularly on the bonus tracks, as if the audio was ran through some type of editing software on a computer. In some of the higher ends of the audio in those bonus tracks you can here like a flangering sound like it was a low encoded mp3 file. And those high synthesized notes really overkill the rest of the other audio that's being played with it. Also there is too much bass on this edition. Now don't get me wrong I love bass but not to the point where it drowns out the other instruments. However this C.D. Re-Issue was worth purchasing for the improved audio on tracks 1-12. Mr. Sandman sounds sharp, crisp and much clearer then on the 1990 re-release. Granted its first release was on Vinyl LP in 1981. I own the Halloween III Soundtrack, also from Varse Sarabande released also making its first appearance in 1990 on the C.D. Format. I have no desire to buy the Re-Release on the same lable as this one here with its extra bonus tracks. As that one really bombed.\n", "val": 4.212668864056468e-05}
{"text": "Well, I had the vinyl of this the mid 1980s. Had the Varese Sarabande cd in the late 1980s. This soundtrack was always my favorite out of the first three Halloween movies. The first cd Halloween II release sounded well, but always a little flat. Finally I see this remaster come along, and man I got real excited!!! Finally got it from amazon, and my ears were serenaded with beautiful crispy remastering, that I waited 20+ years for. Halloween will always be the best of the first three movies, but there are times I like II better. The soundtrack for Halloween II in my opinon surpasses that of Halloween, Halloween as well as its soundtrack always will be the original. Halloween IIs soundtrack is just better Carpenter/Howarth  work, they got it right with this one. Sharper edges, better riffs, than the original, but the Halloween II soundtrack kicks backside big time. Well, with the great remastering, this remaster is a  well deserved Carpenter/Howarth treat. No linear notes, due to its special limited pressing, but who cares, my favorite never sounded better. Carpenter/Howarth fans, or fans of this music, genre must own this remasterd release of Halloween II. I swear when I listen to this I feel like I'm in the movie...............Awesome remaster, FINALLY!!!!!!!!\n", "val": 0.012039121240377426}
{"text": "The boogie man is going to get you!  Just the word \"Halloween\" alone made you believe it could be made into a good movie.  As for John Carpenter's original \"Halloween\" it couldn't be further from the truth.  But with it's success, comes the sequel(s).  And low and behold, born was \"Halloween II.\"  This is a great soundtrack.  To me, it is superior to the original.  Not in terms of composition but in overall production.  Carpenter got to go into a studio and make a really, quintessential soundtrack for the \"Shape\" Micheal Myers.  It is virtually the same music, but more amplified.  I recommend owning this CD to accompany the original.As for this re-release (during the time of the dreaded Rob Zombie version), it's an expand edition.  It has a host of additional tracks, with various differences.  All sounds great.  It also allows one to example different takes and how composers come up with their final work.Overall a great CD.  I only counted it as a 4 out of 5, primarily because it mirrors the original too closely.  If it was a different movie and the original didn't exist, then it would've been listed as a 5.\n", "val": 0.027759378775954247}
{"text": "Check the above product info and be advised: this is not the 'official' release, it looks like another 'burned-on-demand' CD-R of the music from the 'real' disc.  Yes, the price is about half, but for fanatics, you may want to pick up the actual factory-pressed disc from another internet source (including Alan Howarth's official site).  That version is limited to 1000 numbered copies.This disc was released in September, 2009, but it claims to be the 30th anniversary of the film...which was released in 1981.  So what's a couple of years, anyway?The original Varese Sarabande CD is out of print, so this is very welcome and presumably timed to coincide with Rob Zombie's remake / revision of Halloween II, released in August, 2009.  The original material is remastered, so it's a lot crisper and cleaner.  And unlike the remastered discs for The Fog and Escape From New York from earlier this decade, these are not tweaked with new sounds or tones, nor are the track lengths altered.The bonus material consists of six 'suite' tracks that present the complete and original score in chronological order, including some overdubs and subtle tones that try to match what you heard in the movie.  This is a real gem for fans, who often long for a score as it is (or was) presented in a film.  It gives the disc a welcome continuity for the creepy cues from the power due of Carpenter and Howarth.Another very reverent package in line with previous re-releases on the Ahi label of Halloween III (also highly recommended), Prince of Darkness, and They Live.  I would not be surprised if they released another version of the original Halloween score, this time with chronological suites and more of the 'original' sound.  The 20th anniversary disc, while very good, did change some of the music a bit, particularly the opening version of the theme.  The dialogue and sound effect tracks were very welcome and did not overlap into the music, and would have been a fun addition for Halloween II...but that's a fanatical gripe.Highly recommended, this is another quality 'fan-release' and a reason to keep buying CDs (if you care about such things anymore).  Again, this Amazon listing is for a CD-R of the same music, not the limited edition silver disc.  A bit of a strange offering since Amazon sells MP3s...yet they maddeningly do not offer every track ('Suite A' is 'album only').Fanatics will probably want the actual, limited edition CD...you know who you are.\n", "val": 0.0033797973301261663}

{"text": "Big & Rich have proven themselves to be more than just some novelty act: a former Lonestar frontman combined with a failed solo singer.  However, how MUCH more than a novelty act remains to be seen.  Some of their songs have genuine staying power: \"Holy Water,\" \"8th of November,\" \"Lost in This Moment,\" and (whether we like it or not) \"Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy.\"  Other tunes collected here are enjoyable, if not truly great: \"Wild West Show,\" \"Kick My A**,\" and \"Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace\" especially.It's odd that they've released a GREATEST HITS almost completely full of album tracks.  Some (\"Loud\" and \"Jalepeno\" specifically\") could've been replaced with far better selections (\"I Pray for You\" \"Real World,\" and \"Deadwood Mountain\" come immediately to mind); others, such as \"Rollin' (The Ballad of Big & Rich)\" are perfect examples of why the boys have made such an impact: their ability to shirk the rules, to create country music that bends (and even redefines) genres.  Their debut album remains unashamedly one of my favorites; the follow-ups have decreased in quality, resulting in a GREATEST HITS that offers nothing new of note, and features some (let's face it) lackluster material.  Still, Big & Rich have some great songs, and most of them are compiled here; \"Holy Water\" and \"Lost in This Moment\" are alone worth the price of admission.  This album is definitely hit and miss; but when Big & Rich hit, it's like nothing you've ever heard.\n", "val": 0.0019339921418577433}

As always, the sound quality is outstanding and the packaging is great--the booklet is loaded with liner notes about the making of the album.What's surprising is that we only get 2 bonus tracks. There's the 12\" mix of Only for Love, AND the U.S. 12\" mix of Never Ending Story, which is not as readily available on CD as the shorter (and inferior IMO) European 12\" mix. Even so, that mix could also have been included. Most surprisingly though, after reading the liner notes, is that they mention the album being reissued with Never Ending Story on it back in the day when the song became a success, replacing an album track called \"The Greenhouse Effect.\" Yet, they don't include that song as a bonus track here! It also happened to be the b-side of the 12\" mix of Tar Beach, which also isn't included!!! And neither is the 12\" of Too Much Trouble. I'm actually very surprised this stuff was left off, because Gold Legion tends to be very thorough in their releases.

{"text": "Accomplished and Ambitious?  You betcha!  Songs in English, Latin, Spanish and French, no less.  Fearless in depth and breadth of choices.  Orchestras, choirs, slow rhythms, fast tempos and in-between. At the core of every song, arising with rich, gorgeous clarity and crisp, sharp definition out of the surrounding music is David Archuleta's velvety, smoky tenor.Every song speaks volumes.  My top songs (and they change priority every time I listen):What Child Is This - Pure genius.  Genuine, flowing seemingly from the center of Mr. Archuleta's heart and faith.  \"This, this, is Christ the King...Whom shepherds guard and angels sing.\" Vulnerable.  Authentic.  Tender.  STUNNING. And then there are the vocals, the voice, the talent -- but those are secondary to the purity and beauty of the message he delivers.Ave Maria - This prayer on the album is a rare and unexpected gift.  The Infinite.  God.  Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God. Life.  Love.  To be among Angels.  His vocalization of  \"Amen\" is a tsunami of faith.  A live performance could level mountains, make angels faint and demon weep.O Holy Night - Soaring into the heavens and beyond.  Massive love. The Universal One. That last verse is simply gorgeous: \"Noel, Noel...O night, O night divine.  Noel, Noel, O night, O night divine.\"And, then, there is Pat-A-Pan. Mysterious. Edgy.  A march.  \"Tu-re-lu-re-lu, pat-a-pat-a-pan.\"  David's voice giving us the sound of the drum, pat-a-pan, and the fife (small flute), tu-re-lu-re-lu, that the shepherds played to celebrate the birth of Jesus.  I suspect reams will be written about this song, especially the last sixty seconds.The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel flashes through my mind when I hear the magnificent vocals and melodic interpretations with this collection of songs.

My favorite is \"O Holy Night.\"  I have heard him sing this live as well, and no words can really describe how well he sings live ... the best I can describe it is that it's like hearing someone from heaven above singing.  The emotional depth in his vocals is amazing, and even more important than his singing is the fact that he is a good person.  He has been setting a good example for everyone from the start, and he is continuing to do so.  A perfect example of this is the fact that he served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for two years until he returned this year.

I'm telling you, I've heard many people sing that particular song several times since her passing in 1995 but NOBODY has gotten as close to the way she sung it, as David did. It was like hearing her but only in a masculine voice; same emotion, intensity and passion. Since that moment, I was hooked and then later I found out that he only has use of one vocal cord, the other is paralyzed. How amazing that a young man that only has use of one vocal cord can sing so powerful and with such passion. I'm definitely buying \"BEGIN\", Forevermore, and Christmas From The Heart. He has a God-given gift. I hope these next two years go quick and then we'll see what God has planned for him and us.P.s.

Some of my favorite musicians have released Christmas albums that I simply can't stand.This album is one of the rare exceptions.  David's distinctive talent shines through without overpowering the traditional feel of the music.It's the end of January: the Christmas tree is boxed up, the decorations are packed away, and the lights have come down, but I can't put this album away--I'm still listening to it almost every day!\n", "val": 0.004912666045129299}

The tracks feel \"cheap\", and David takes too many liberties with the melodies of the songs. Maybe I'm just someone who prefers Christmas tracks to be more straight-forward and from the heart instead of over-the-top productions, but I'm really disappointed in this album.

This is smart because a lot of the credit for this album should go to his great writer, producer, arranger and pianist  Kurt Bestor who KNOWS Christmas.

{"text": "This album came out last year and immediately became a favorite in my collection of holiday music.  There are many great singers who've put their stamps on Christmas standards, but David's gift is for infusing heartfelt emotion.  David's collection is remarkable, especially for someone so young.  This is a very traditional album, sung with great reverence, an album of LOVE songs--every song, especially the traditional Christmas hymns are sung with sincere emotion.  David is often compared to to Josh Groban.  Both are technically gifted singers.  Groban has more power to his voice and his training certainly shows in his performances.  But I FEEL more when I listen to David sing Christmas songs.  There is just a unique, special quality to David's voice and tone--every note drips with feeling, and pure, youthful beauty.I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Christmas music or great singing.  Personal favorites here include Silent Night--David's restraint is lovely, the song is a prayer; The First Noel--really lovely arrangement and vocal; O Holy Night--very moving performance, especially the final verse and chorus; Ave Maria--a daunting song and David handles it very well--his \"Amen\" at the end is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard; Pat a Pan and Riu Riu Chiu--two songs probably not familiar to most Americans but David is charming on these and the arrangements are fresh, vibrant and contemporary.Many of these SONGS should be on the radio during the holiday season.  Unfortunately, that probably won't happen, with the sorry state of radio these days.  Trust me and buy this album.

{"text": "I wasn't sure what to expect, as his debut album was good (I can't get \"Crush\" out of my head), but definitely showed his youth and a teen pop style.  This Christmas Album shows more of the maturity and vocal risk taking that foreshadows the great singer he might be capable of becoming.  It unexpectedly leaped into my top 5 favorite Christmas Albums (along with Josh Groban, David Foster, Mariah Carey, and Michael Buble).  David shows more than a glimmer of the incredible vocalist he is going to be, with a soaring rendition of \"Oh Holy Night\" that - although distinctly different stylistically - I couldn't believe I enjoyed as much as Michael Crawford's.  My only complaint is that when taking on a big song, he somewhat loudly gasps for air, or breathes in the middle of a phrase (or word).  I think that's the sort of thing he will learn to control better as he matures as an artist.

Even my husband, who is also not religious, borrowed my car and later remarked, \"that's a great CD you have in the car.\"  So this was my CD of 2009, in spite of the fact that some of my favorite songs on it are about things in which I don't believe.

David's voice is absolutely tailor-made for this sort of music, and he uses it to fantastic effect.To be honest, the production on the CD was less than perfect, but it's certainly not terrible and David's fantastic vocals more than make up for any other shortcomings on the CD.  The title of the CD is very aptly chosen, as David truly does sound like he's singing from the heart, which makes all the difference in the world.  His version of \"O Holy Night\" in particular, is one of my favorites.If you enjoy great Christmas classics, buy this CD.  It's fantastic.\n", "val": 0.02322257310152054}

{"text": "There are some real gems here. David's \"Joy to the World\" is the best I've heard, with enough of his melodic variations to make the song sound new and even more beautiful. But my favorite track is \"Pat a Pan\" and David delivers one of the the best versions out there, maybe the best. I had never heard of \"Riu Riu Chiu\", but it's a welcome and lively new addition to our Christmas playlist. The other songs are very good, solid versions, infused with David's own style. But for the most part  he's covering very familiar songs that so many others have done, and his \"O Holy Night\", \"Silent Night\", for example, are not so wonderful that David can knock Nat King Cole or the Celtic Women off their thrones. Of the other songs, \"What Child is This\" is both the best and the biggest disappointment, because it so suits him and the instrumentation should have been more simple, perhaps more celtic, to show off his fabulous voice and obvious emotional connection to the song. And perhaps he should have sung the 14th Century Christmas version. But his voice, like the melody and the lyrics, is beautiful. If, however, you are looking for a beautiful and slightly different Christmas album, one of the best ever is James Taylor's.  But perfect is perfect, and David's five-star perfect. David and Bob Dylan both have released very fine new albums for 2009. David's is \"Christmas FROM the Heart\" and Bob's is \"Christmas IN the Heart\". Coincidence? I think not. Two very different voices, but two stellar musicians.\n", "val": 0.03002040460705757}

Ave Maria brings out the wonderfully soft and smooth glory notes we loved to hear on American Idol. Pat-A-Pan and Riu Riu Chiu two of the more lively and fun tracks on the album.

I wish the album contained more new Christmas compositions best suited to David's contemporary style as demonstrated in the last cut.  This production needed more thought and deliberation.  Moreover, David's picturers came across as very different.  Rather than the \"teen-age-sensously-inviting\" look, he almost resembled a \"raindeer?\" to me both at the front and inside covers.

{"text": "I seem to have broken the mold by not giving this album either one star or five stars. I read gushing reviews such as, \"OMG it's like the best Christmas album EVER!!\" and am forced to dismiss them out of hand just because of the obvious absence of objectivity. On the other end of the scale, you get the the apparent trolls who may or may not have even listened to the music. I'm somewhat a fan of David Archuleta, and I have always liked Christmas music, so I had high expectations for this album, and my opinion of it after hearing it a few times is very favorable. It's really quite good, but I could honestly have done without the inclusion of some of the first four or five songs. They're somewhat overworn and tepid, even with Archuleta's admirable vocals. Do we really need to hear \"The First Noel\" again? That said, his version of \"Silent Night\" is admittedly very nice... better than the preceding cover of \"O Come All Ye Faithful.\" (Steven Curtis Chapman's 1995 reworking of that song is still my top choice.) I would have personally preferred some of the less popular carols like \"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\" or \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear.\" I think both of those songs would have been amazingly well-suited to Archuleta's talents. For more updated songs, I'd have enjoyed his take on \"Mary, Did You Know?\" or \"Grown-Up Christmas List,\" although Amy Grant's 1992 version of the latter, which I think is the original, continues to be the one I go back to again and again and would likely be hard to supplant as my favorite.For the most part, the orchestration is excellent, never more so than on \"What Child Is This?\" Long one of my favorites, the version here is simply outstanding in every respect. The simplicity of the haunting melody is accompanied by a pan flute (I think) first, then a flamenco guitar is added, and underscored in parts by an almost cinematic swelling of strings midway through... absolutely gives me chills. The orchestra is allowed to do its thing, then fades away to allow an almost a capella beginning to the next verse. The vocals are flawless. (However, I do question changing the well-known lyrics \"where ox and ass are feeding\" to \"ox and ewe.\" Come on.) There was a breathing/phrasing issue once in the song (breathing in the middle of the very short phrase, \"son (breath) of Mary,\" but these are minor quibbles over what is a truly fantastic arrangement and performance.Likewise, Archuleta's rendition of \"O Holy Night\" is superb, offering no real surprises, but delivering solidly. The arrangement is excellent, particularly on the musical tension the orchestra creates in the transition from the first verse to the second. Archuleta's vocals are a bit nasal and strained on the obligatory \"glory note\" near the end, but not excessively so. For me, the cardinal sin he commits on this song is taking a breath in the middle of the word \"divine\" at the very end of the song, a common mistake of less-polished singers (breathing between syllables in a word) and one I'm surprised he made so glaringly, given his experience. Ohhh nighttt... dee-eeee... *breathe* ... vine... I nearly groaned aloud. No, David! NO!The less-familiar tunes, \"Pat-A-Pan\" and \"Riu Riu Chiu\" are both very enjoyable and Archuleta pulls off singing in French and Spanish exceptionally well. The original track, \"Melodies of Christmas\" is pleasant enough, if not especially memorable. The lone duet on the album, with breakout young Filipino star Charice Pempengo, \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\" is outstanding, although I think she overdoes it a bit with the melismas early on in the song. However, the arrangement is terrific and their voices blend exquisitely on the harmony parts. I won't be surprised to hear this one on the radio throughout the holidays.Finally, the rendition of \"Ave Maria\" is simply gorgeous. Backed by a children's choir, Archuleta delivers almost perfectly on this song. Although plagued with yet another breathing/phrasing problem (breathing in the middle of the word \"ventris\" -- twice!), his Latin diction is excellent... he sings \"Ahh-veh\" instead of the more common (and wrong) \"Ah-vay\" and sing \"gratia\" with the correct Latin pronunciation, not the Italian diction (graht-see-a) you often hear. I don't really love his final \"amen\" at the song's end, but again, a tiny, minor quibble. This song is a masterpiece, and I'm glad it was included on the album. (Surprisingly, the old boyband 98 Degrees had a wonderful rendition of this song on their otherwise bland Christmas album.)The truly hideous cover art and questionable cover photo of this album notwithstanding (seriously, I almost took off another star for that alone), it's a worthwhile addition to any collection of Christmas music. Easily worth the $11 it costs, and some of these songs will certainly become perennial favorites for fans of Christmas music. Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.004182996228337288}

The other classic he performs and really makes his own, \"I'll be Home for Christmas\" which is a blend of powerful and nuanced vocals.

{"text": "It certainly didn't surprise me that David 2 would churn out a Christmas album just in time to cash in on the holiday music season, and while I'm far from the gushing fan, I thought I would give it a try.  Even I must admit that despite his schmaltzy demeanor (on American Idol and off) which lends so well to his frothing fanbase, I can't deny that this kid has SOME talent.  He has decent tone, fairly good pitch and a pleasant enough vibrato, which made this album somewhat bearable.  But as young as he is, he certainly doesn't have a lot of life mileage under his belt, which gravity a lot of these classic carols require, and it shows on these tracks.  It sounds at times like a kid who sang in church decided to record a Christmas album, found a backup singer or two and someone with a drum machine, and put it out there.  The songs chosen are standard Christmas fare, and include one original selection (which tries really hard, but ultimately sounds like an overproduced, sparkly, digital winter wonderland, rather than anything really original and memorable), and while, in the end, the lovely tunes are hard to mess up, he manages to make them sound like little more than elevator music regardless.  It's not THAT bad, really (though some of his more nasal held-out notes and poor pronunciation truly were pretty hard to listen through), but it's certainly no 5-star offering and doesn't warrant the gushing praise it's receiving: It's a quickly-produced and -released bunch of Christmas tracks that appeals primarily to fangirls, teeny-boppers and their moms.  Kudos, though, for choosing an almost entirely Christ-centered repertoire, since most Christmas albums are filled primarily with songs about Santa Claus, toys and falling snow.  I have nothing against those songs, really, but let's not forget the reason for the season.As a side note, whoever was responsible for choosing the photo for the cover art should be dismissed forthwith.  Surely this gooby expression couldn't have been his best shot.\n", "val": 0.00023274209524970502}

His asset is undoubtedly his pure and clear voice! His duet with our very own Charice was beautiful. Their voices blended perfectly in \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.\" Two of my all-time favorite Christmas songs happen to be in this album - \"O Holy Night\" and \"Ave Maria.\" David sings them perfectly and when he sings those high notes effortlessly, it gives me goose bumps everytime! I must also commend David for his correct diction in singing \"Ave Maria.\" He sang and enunciated the words like they should be because most American artists always sing the words the American way. \"Ave,\" for example, should be sung as \"A-veh\" and not \"Avay.\" David's and Josh Groban's version of \"Ave Maria\" are two of the best I have ever heard.

{"text": "It seems every singer, whether well-known or obscure, feels they have to record the obligatory Christmas album.  Most end up being a train wreck, many of the so-called artists don't observe Christmas or even know anything about it but they are quick to make a buck by singing about it.Then we have David Archuleta.  Yes the same David who was the geeky baby-fat kid on the tacky talent show who amazed us with his huge voice.  David is not yet even 20, yet he is in the rarified company of being a true musical genius, one of the handful of singers on Earth who actually CAN sing.Unlike so many singers who blightly croak out the same holiday-themed words without depth or meaning, David truly does sing from the heart.  He went into this album with a profound knowledge of the meaning of each and every word and polishes them to diamond magnificence.  At the same time as he displays his intimate knowledge of the true meaning of Christmas he sings with a childlike innocence that few entertainers have ever possessed.And, a pet peeve of mine, David knows how to pronounce the word Christmas.  Sorry to all those singers who think it's pronounced \"creasemiss\" ... you lose.Here is a song-by-song mini-review:JOY TO THE WORLD - David takes the tempo down on this classic, nourishing each word, encouraging the listener to \"repeat the sounding joy\".  You can almost see David's eyes sparkle as he feels his own joy at the story he sings to us.ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD ON HIGH - This song often comes across as trite and fluffy from many singers.  David joins the angels on magical flight over a sleeping world on the eve of Christmas to proclaiming the birth of the child ... peaceful, serene yet jubilant at the same time.O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL - One of the most sung songs at Christmastime, David wisely stays true to the roots of this classic.  His arrangement could and should become the new definitive version.SILENT NIGHT - Often sung more as a monotonous love ballad, David begins this song at almost a whisper.  He surprises us by ratcheting up the volume, intensity and emotion to the point we understand what the Austrian priest Father Josef Mohr and the Austrian headmaster Franz Xavier Gruber felt when they first wrote the lyrics and the melody.  Not just an observation of a silent night but a call for each of us to do our part for peace on earth.THE FIRST NOEL - After the first verse, David takes us on a personal introspective muse.  \"Born is the King\" he repeats ... his sense of wonder of that concept makes this the most beautiful arrangement of The First Noel in history.O HOLY NIGHT - One of my personal favorites, I have heard many beautiful versions.  As he does with O Come All Ye Faithful, David does not over-dramatize this classic.  If anything his restraint retains the holy and reverent theme of the lyrics.  David has been singing this song since he was a child and it is evident that it is more part of his daily life than something to be pulled out of the closet once a year.HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS (duet with Charice Pempengco) - I don't know who Charice is but she has a beautiful smokey voice in the style of Natalie Cole.  Together they are as natural as Astaire & Rogers, Carter & Cash, Bogart & Bacall, etc.  Delightful.I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS - this is a song that is hard to make believable when sung by a Hollywood mega-millionaire.  That is why there are so many bad versions.  David's sincerity and modesty gives him the perfect insight to make us feel the sadness, and hope, this song inspires.PAT-A-PAN - A traditional French Christmas carol, David expands his amazing talent by singing it partially in French.  The song tells of the birth of Jesus in a way reminiscent of The Little Drummer Boy ...Willie, bring your little drum;Robin, bring your flute and come;And be merry while you play,Tu-re-lu-re-lu,Pat-a-pat-a-pan,Come be merry while you play,Let us make our Christmas gay!The lyrics are meant to mimic the sound of a flute and drum.  David is having fun here and it's hard to resist getting up and dancing around the room while he sings it.WHAT CHILD IS THIS - Is David Archuleta capable of not amazing us with his range of talent?  The arrangement of this song makes me picture him as a young minstrel boy on the streets of Bethlehem 2000 years ago who has just learned of what happened in the manger.  No one is around at first as he sings in wonderment to himself but he soon gathers an ever-expanding crowd as the message is spread through the village and over the earth.RIU RIU CHIU - Sung in Spanish, this 15th Century song is likely unknown to most listeners.  The song is sung in a way to be reminiscent of the sounds of a nightingale.  It is a beautiful addition to David's first Christmas album.AVE MARIA - this perhaps is the most beautiful song on a beautiful album.  Simple acoustic accompaniment, David's angelic voice (singing in Latin), this is the first time we hear David in an almost operatic voice.  I dare say if he soloed on the stage of the world's greatest opera houses he would bring the house down with thunderous standing ovations.  Have I called David a musical genius yet?  If so, I repeat it. Bravo!MELODIES OF CHRISTMAS - In case anyone thinks I blindly like anything and everything David does, this is the reality check.  I give him credit for including Pat-A-Pan and Riu Riu Chiu but WHY do singers feel they have to try to introduce \"new\" classics?  This song isn't as bad as \"Last Christmas\" or \"Grandma Got Runned over by a Reindeer\" but it is way too clich&eacute;d.  Little hints of Christmas melodies, the same hackneyed lyrics that we will incessantly hear on the radio in the weeks before Christmas.  David, I know you wrote this song and it means things to you, but sorry, as one of the judges on that talent contest would say \"it's forgettable\".\n", "val": 0.006083519198000431}

{"text": "I didn't hesitate to buy this CD.  David Archuleta was impressive on Idol, and I like the timbre of his voice.  So, I was pleasantly surprised to find he had released a Christmas CD.  My favorite Christmas CD of all time is Carpenters' Christmas Portrait (and add some of the tracks from their Old Fashioned Christmas).  However, Archuleta's Christmas recordings add something new to the mix and should be on a constant rotation for the season.  I believe the CD will do well, too, and should add some credibility to his vocal abilities (he gets a bad rap for being a teen idol).  He doesn't just sing by rote - he adds emotion to the recordings, displays his vocal range and control, and shows a level of maturity beyond his years.  I really love O Holy Night (actually my favorite of all Christmas songs is O Holy Night, and only Mariah Carey made me almost hate it), and he now occupies the second position on my list of favorite versions - behind Josh Groban.  Beyond that, I'm hard pressed to rank the other tracks.  Great versions of Angels We Have Heard, Joy to the World, Ave Maria.  And the addition of Pat-a-Pan and Riu Riu Chiu add to the diversity.  And yes, What Child Is This and The First Noel are excellent.  I've been fortunate to build a nice collection of Christmas music, and this is a most welcome addition.  I put it near the top.  So, my recommendation if you're not a big fan because of his teen status is to drop the stigma, get over the stereotype, and give this CD a fair hearing.

{"text": "From the traditional hymns, to the more secular songs, to the original song \"Melodies of Christmas\", David Archuleta pours his heart and soul into each and every selection bringing the listeners, a moving, exhilirating, and pleasing experience.  Gone are the tired arrangements often heard from other artists.  These song arrangements and performances will not disappoint.David impeccably delivers these songs in his own soulful but very tasteful interpretations that personify who he is --- a kind, caring young man whose strong moral values are portrayed by how he lives and treats others.It's difficult to choose favorites on this album; they are so moving in different ways.  \"Silent Night\" is just breathtaking; I've never been so moved by any interpretation of this song ever before.  Likewise, \"Joy to the World\", \"O Come All Ye Faithful\", and \"Angels...High/Jesus...\" have been transformed from mere hymns to moving experiences.  The simpicity of \"What Child is This\" is mesmerizing.  And of course, \"Ave Maria\" and \"O Holy Night\" are beyond amazing.Although \"Melodies of Christmas\" - the song co-written by David, is more secular in nature, its spiritual message is inherent.  \"Melodies...\" as well as \"Pat-a-Pan\", \"Riu Rui Chiu\" bring a more light-hearted side to the album and are just fun.And the sentimental favorites \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" and \"Have Yourself...Christmas\" -although familiar - are brought back to life by the more contemporary twist they are given.In short, there is NO song on this album that you'll want to fast-forward.  Thank you, David, as well as all musicians, arrangers, producers, and of course, Jive Records for giving us this wonderful listening experience we'll enjoy for years to come.\n", "val": 0.023536739870905876}
{"text": "This album is surprisingly really good. I thought it would be boring because it's mostly traditional carols. I was glad I was mistaken.  David singing traditional carols with an orchestra accompaniment in the background gives these songs a different feel. They sound fresh and they're no longer the same beat up carols that you hear on the radio year after year.  In these traditional carols, David seems to follow a pattern of singing the simple melody at the beginning and then lets loose in the middle until the end. I must tell you that the 30 second snippets do not represent what you will hear when you listen to the songs in their entirety. This album shows he can sing soul, ballad, pop. All the songs are done really well. I believe, however, that the crowning jewel of this album is What Child Is This. If you can't afford to download the whole album, I would say at least get this one. It has a celtic feel and also a flamenco feel to it and the singing is simply beautiful. Other favorites are Pat-A-Pan, Riu Riu Chiu, Melodies of Christmas, and of course Ave Maria. Overall, I'm giving this album five stars for the great quality of its production and for the singer's powdery smooth, beautiful vocals.\n", "val": 0.025472410023212433}
{"text": "I've been looking forward to this album since I first heard that DA was doing a Christmas CD because he was BORN to sing songs like this. I love everything about David -- especially his voice -- and I love Christmas music, so I knew I couldn't go wrong with this album, but it has FAR & AWAY exceeded my expectations! David is even backed on some songs by the City of Prague Philharmonic. Are you kidding me?!? I can't stop listening to it! David takes Christmas classics and changes them just enough to give them his own personal touch without murdering the songs or making them unrecognizable. You really can FEEL the emotion he feels when he sings. He truly does sing straight from his heart, so this album is titled perfectly! I enjoyed the review written by David Pearl \"a 30 year old Jewish male\" who said that, although he is not a Christian, he was \"touched and inspired\" by this CD. That's what David does. He has the power to reach EVERYONE with his voice & music. Like DA said in his liner notes for the CD: \"I want the experiences that you may feel through the music to communicate to you in your own personal language, and in light of your spiritual or religious beliefs. Music has a universal message that can speak to people of different ages, beliefs, and languages and can reach beyond the supposed obvious meaning of the lyrics and can allow everyone to feel something special. It is my hope that through this music you can feel something meaningful to you.\" Mission accomplished David!! This is sure to be a Christmas classic in my home and many, many others!!\n", "val": 0.02234509587287903}

A fine varied selections of songs here, beautiufully orchestrated and sung to perfection by my all time American Idol winner (which he was in my opinion). I love the arrangement of Oh Come All Ye Fairhful and Joy to the World, I was a little thrown off with Patapan, I've never heard an arrangement like it before, having loved the version on Julie Andrew's christmas CD, but David brings his own touch with a more modern sound to one of my favorites, and I have never found anything he has done to be less than great. David if you read this (and I know many artists read reviews here) my hats off to you on using an orchestra and choir this time, it is pefection, and If you are reading this, I hope one day to hear that beautiful voice combined with an orchestra for a Broadway CD with Andrew Lloyd Webber music, and songs like Climb Every Mountain from The Sound of Music, Music of the Night from Phantom of the Opera, I won't Send Roses from Mack and Mabel or even Never Never Land from Peter Pan.

Except for Melodies of Christmas and Riu Riu Chiu, these are songs we've all heard over and over and it would be easy to dismiss this album based on the tracklist, but please don't. You have not heard these songs sung like this before. The little clips do not do this album justice at all.  The album is broken into parts, kind of grouping the songs together. So in the beginning are the Christmas hymns, the songs that focus on Christ. Then there are two in the middle, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and I'll be Home for Christmas, that are more modern. The last third are songs that are a little less familiar. These songs are my favorites off the album. I love What Child Is This with the spanish guitar. Pat a Pan is so interesting and is my favorite of the album. Riu Riu Chiu is very catchy and has a beautiful melody. Ave Maria is my other favorite and is just beautiful. The album ends with the one original song, Melodies of Christmas.

Seriously, you do not have to be a Christian, to love this music. It is a true masterpiece. And I do not say that lightly. David has managed in the most uncanny way to get inside each and every song and bring out the real Love that underscores them. I have had tears and chills throughout listening to it. His voice is an exquisite instrument and that combined with his ability to give new meaning to these songs, making each one almost like you have never heard it before, is quite an achievement. This is a word of mouth album. As the word spreads, I think it is going to explode onto the charts as one of the greatest Christmas albums of all time.  I think most of us love these songs, especially at this time of the year. But this album is something else. It truly took me by surprise. It's almost like he showed me them as if I had never heard them before. David brings an energy here combined with his immense interpretive powers that transcends religions and genres. This music inspired me to write this review. It inspired me, also, to wish each and every one of you the merriest of Christmases and the happiest of New Years.  Let's put it this way, I am now centered in the Christmas spirit. And it's not even Halloween yet.

{"text": "When Crush was released, I wrote a review for this site that spoke of David's vocal skills that required a slightly deeper listening amidst a teen market pop album. I read the early reviews for Christmas From The Heart and assumed that this new effort, done amidst a heavy tour schedule, would be a next step in his development and a nice example of a talented and seemingly very decent young man singing tradional Holiday music. I was simply unprepared for what I heard. First, the production values , as described in other reviews, are transformative for this \" well known\" body of music. Many arrangements and orchestrations give a new feel to the music and a \" lush\" and even moving sweep to a host of musical phrases. They are not cloying but in synch with something within David's voice and capacity to capture the essential feeling within the songs.I was driving to work and listening on less than perfect car audio. It is really worth the effort to listen with as a good a fidelity as you can find since the sounds of orchestra, chorus, and David's voice are additive. They create musical spaces that are almost jarring in their ability to make the listener \" feel \" these songs. Whatever the qualities of voice and music that stir emotion, you will very likely find it here. Many of these songs, so well known, come at you with surprise as if you have not heard them before. That is what is so moving as if this is a discovery of a new body of work by a singer becoming a musical artist.Everyone will have a favorite, whether song or phrase, because we each will bring a different emotional memory or expectation to the music. Although a Christmas album, the sum of the its impact is really non denominational and surprisingly affecting even for skeptical listeners waiting for mawkish and commercial pandering. This is a breakthrough album for it shows what soaring ablility , musical validity and professionalism, and guileless emotion can give us.\n", "val": 0.018245963379740715}

David really poured his heart and soul into this holiday album and it's very clear when I listen to this; his ability to sing and express the complete range of human emotions is outstanding. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like the artwork as well.The album starts with \"Joy to the World;\" David sings this with panache and the arrangement plays with the tempo and the keys to let David put his own stamp on this classic ballad! He also really opens up and sings those lyrics with a voice that sounds like that of a much more seasoned entertainer; his talent is quite natural and he also has the ability to go much, much further in his chosen profession which is truly exciting. \"Angels We Have Heard on High\" has a lush musical arrangement and David makes this shine with his fantastic singing. \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" has always been a favorite holiday tune of mine; David Archuleta performs this with panache and he never lets go of a single superfluous note! I love it.\"Silent Night\" gets a most sensitive treatment from David who delivers this to perfection--and beyond! \"Silent Night\" is definitely a highlight of this album; and listen for David to do a superb job on \"The First Noel.\" \"The First Noel\" charms me with its natural beauty and David's voice sounds like a finely tuned instrument as he sings this faultlessly.Charice Pempengco joins David for \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas;\" this was first performed by Judy Garland in \"Meet Me in Saint Louis.\" David and Charice make this ballad an outstanding highlight of the album. The somewhat jazzy arrangement fits perfectly with their vocals and I really like their rendition of \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\" It's heaven.\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" was my mother's favorite holiday song; and David does this justice! He sings this passionately and you can tell he really means it from his heart when you hear him on this track. \"Pat-A-Pan\" is thrown in for a good effect; David performs this very well and it's a good number. \"What Child Is This\" is another charmer that David aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing--but of course we know that it really wasn't all that easy. David's talent carries him through.\"Ave Maria\" sounds just perfect; and the album ends so well with David Archuleta performing \"Melodies of Christmas.\" \"Melodies of Christmas\" is a strong ending number for the album and it certainly leaves me wanting more!David Archuleta delivers on this holiday album and I'm fantastically impressed.

{"text": "Prime Cuts:  Little Wood Guitar, City of Silver Dreams, Nuttin' for ChristmasChristmas CDs are a knotty affair:  almost every successful artist is mandated to release one yuletide offering nowadays whether or not the set is birthed from the heart.  With 5 number 1 hits, 3 multi-platinum albums, and a prime time TV special, success certainly has been a close relative of Sugarland.  And like many country superstars, they have been lobbied by their record company to cut a seasonal effort as a stop-gap album in lieu of a brand new studio CD this year.  Yet, this duo has not treated this as a contractual CD.  Rather, on this hybrid effort, they have invested 5 original tunes, some of which are among their most heartfelt compositions.  Even when they tackle the seasonal chestnuts, they have endorsed their interpretations with innovative creativity.  Bursting the seams of genre classifications, these 10 cuts are made so much more interesting with doses of r & b, jazz, pop, country rock as well as even some traces of bluegrass.The set's opener \"City of Silver Dreams\" is an instant heart grabber--a polished country pop ballad about a wide-eyed country girl's first Christmas in the urban jungle of New York City.  Jennifer Nettles' heartfelt delivery emotes in convincing ways the loneliness of being homesick that truly staggers the heart.  \"Little Wood Guitar,\" written by Ellis Paul and Kristian Bush, is a finely honed narrative piece telling the story of how a girl's life changed since she received a guitar as her only gift one Christmas.  Yet not is syrupy sentimental; Sugarland shows that they know how to have fun with \"Nuttin' for Christmas.\"  Cute, fun, and definitely catchy--Nettles truly sounds like she's having fun and easily \"Nuttin' for Christmas\" would rock well in the ranks of classics such as \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\" and \"Jingle Bells.\"  However, not all the originals are of that lofty in standard:  \"Maybe Baby\" sounds like a track from their standard album with \"Christmasy\" references tagged on.  While \"Coming Home\" is pretty average this time finding the duo in r&b territory with a light touch of Gospel.As for the seasonal favourites, Sugarland does step out of the tried and tested box.  This duo gives \"Winter Wonderland\" a country boogie makeover that is infectious.  While most renditions of \"O Come O Come Emanuel\" are dirge-like slow, Sugarland offers a bluegrassy take of this hymn making it sound like a rootsy Southern Gospel revival number.  Never to be restrained by the language barrier, \"Silent Night\" is sung bilingually in both English and Spanish.  This time \"Silent Night\" finds Jennifer Nettles trading lines with Kristian Bush making one wish they would sing more duets together.  Kristian Bush again returns to the microphone to sing lead on \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" which is quite jovial without being exceptional.Relative to most Christmas CDs out there, \"Gold and Green\" shows personality.  More than just a holiday album, this is very much a Sugarland record.  They have left their patented mark all over.  Even the traditional old favourites have been re-vamped.  However, like their studio albums, with the originals coming mostly from their own pens, some of them become pretty average pop country efforts.  Other than that, \"Gold and Green\" is much more than your average sonic ornament.\n", "val": 0.01612774096429348}
{"text": "With holiday shopping beginning earlier every year, why not have some fresh Christmas music to spur it along...enter Sugarland's 10 song cd Gold and Green. Actaully, 5 of these tracks have been previously released as a bonus cd in 2007. Yet those songs, for the most part, have been almost a best-kept secret reserved for Jennifer and Kristian's fans up until now. The lead track, \"City of Silver Dreams\" depicts NYC with lyrics as timeless as \"White Christmas\" or \"Silver Bells\"...Jennifer's delivery, while still distinctly country, takes Sugarland to a new level with a chorus of which even Irving Berlin would be proud. The title track is a sweet lullaby which one can imagine singing at bedtime to the little ones on Christmas Eve. The classic covers \"Winter Wonderland\", \"O Come Emmanuel\" (with its bare, haunting arrangement)and \"Silent Night\" (sung in English and Spanish) all show Jennifer Nettles' mastery of her vocal instrument's vast range of colors.  Kristian's \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" and \"Maybe Baby\" give us a broader offering of  his unique, charming and quite capable vocal chops...The  Sugarland version of \"Nuttin' For Christmas\" is a fun backporch jam that will bring a smile. \"Coming Home\" is a bluesy, gospel-styled \"home for the holidays\" that  successfully puts a Sugarland touch on another musical genre. Last, but certainly not least, \"Little Wood Guitar\" (part of the 2007 release) is truly worth the price of the cd alone; this Kristian Bush written song effectively brings to focus how a simple gift can transform a life...precious holiday food for thought. Sugarland's Gold and Green is a officially the first Holiday album from this prolific duo and hopefully one of many more to come.\n", "val": 0.021879058331251144}
{"text": "The traditional covers are done in only a style that Sugarland can do (complete with verses of \"Silent Night\" in Spanish).  It is amazing!  But the songs that shine the brightest on this album are the brand new holiday songs.  \"Coming Home\" has a very blues/soulful sound to it and is reminiscent of the Jennifer Nettles Band-style music.  My favorites are \"City of Silver Dreams\" (the perfect holiday song), \"Coming Home\" and \"Little Wood Guitar\".Yes - these may be \"Christmas\" songs, but the new original songs on here transcend religious beliefs.  They are truely year-round songs of family, love, gratefulness and dreams.This album is magical from start to finish!

{"text": "Although I've long meant to buy some of Sugarland's earlier albums, I haven't yet so this is my first album of theirs. It certainly reminds me that I really must buy those other albums. This is one of the more imaginative Christmas albums around, with several original songs and a sprinkling of old chestnuts, all done in typical Sugarland style. Jennifer Nettles sings most of the lead vocals, but Kristian Bush takes the lead on Holly jolly Christmas and Maybe baby New Year's day.Although Sugarland's music is rooted in country (some tracks actually utilize a steel guitar), it has a contemporary urban feel to it, clearly illustrated by the opening track, City of silver dreams. Traditional country songs usually contrast the big bad cities and the nasty people who inhabit them with the rural life that they acknowledge as tough but at least the people are nice, examples being Detroit city (Bobby Bare), I'm gonna be a country girl again (Buffy Sainte-Marie) and Big city (Merle Haggard). The opening track shows how far country songs have changed, as it pays enthusiastic homage to New York, including one verse about St Patrick's Cathedral and another about 5th Avenue. Instead of regarding New York as heartless and soulless, country singers now recognize that New York can be enjoyable.Following that opener are a couple of standards (Winter wonderland), which are given a distinctive Sugarland treatment but still stick to the basic original arrangement, so they should still sound reassuringly familiar enough to satisfy traditionalists. Next come three original songs. The first of these, Coming home, makes no reference to Christmas and could be about a homecoming at any time of year, but it certainly fits in here comfortably. The title track describes some of the good feelings of Christmas, while the sad song, Maybe baby New year's day, finds a man reflecting on how Christmas used to be with a woman who is only a memory.Nuttin' for Christmas, a song first recorded by the Fontane Sisters, is a wonderful upbeat fun song that is rarely recorded. Next comes the standard O come O come Emmanuel, which Jennifer sings with the dignity it requires. A very stately song, the instrumentation includes two banjos, which is not exactly what one might expect, but they are played with great restraint while providing a distinctive touch. Nobody will mistake Sugarland's version of this carol for any other.The last original song here, Little wood guitar, is about a Christmas gift given to a girl (Jennifer?) who eventual becomes successful. A great story song, it ranks alongside the opening track and the title track as one of the three best tracks here, although the entire album is brilliant. The album ends with an excellent bilingual version of Silent night.This album took a few spins to grown on me, but I appreciated it more each time I played it. While the album is generally upbeat, I'm not convinced that it would work as party music, but it would be great at any other time of the festive season.\n", "val": 0.02188841812312603}

{"text": "I own all of Sugarland's releases so far, and this is just another awesome one. On this Christmas album, there are five songs written by the members of Sugarland, and five classic Christmas songs. Normally I'd be wary of orignal Christmas songs, but with Sugarland, there's nothing to worry about. \"City of Silver Dreams\" and \"Gold And Green\" sounds like classic Christmas songs already, with lines like \"Looks like somebody's birthday party to me\" and \"Everything looks better in gold and green.\" \"Maybe Baby\" and \"Little Wood Guitar\" are also wonderful songs. On the more classic Christmas songs, Sugarland does not let down. \"Holly Jolly Christams\" and \"Nuttin' for Christmas\" are fun songs to sing along with, while \"O come O Come Emmanuel\" and Silent Night\" speak about meaning of Christmas.

{"text": "If you're tired of the same old cover versions of traditional Christmas music, you're not alone.  Sugarland must have felt the same way, for this nifty little early Christmas present from country's premiere duo contains as many original holiday-themed compositions as it does reworkings of the expected chestnuts.  The pair even puts their signature style on some of the cover versions.  For example, it might be hard to picture anyone else singing \"Nuttin' for Christmas\" after hearing Jennifer Nettles' comically mischievous take on the song.But it's the 5 original compositions that really separate GOLD AND GREEN from the rest of the holiday pack.  \"City of Silver Dreams\" opens the disc with snowy sweet love letter to New York City, a song that surely deserves a place among the all-time great Christmas tunes.  \"Coming Home\" revisits the theme of the band's first single \"Baby Girl\" (even going so far as to have the mother in the song ask 'How's my baby girl?'), and it's hard not to see art imitating life when one realizes it was just 5 short years ago that Nettles and Co. burst onto the scene with that slice of life-on-the-road.  The title track evokes a sort of country-tinged Carpenters, although even Karen Carpenter never got so choice a line as \"The butter light of candlesticks/Chases snowflakes off the bricks.\"  Kristian Bush takes the mic for \"Maybe Baby (New Year's Day)\", a restless plea to see an old lover during the holidays.  While probably the weakest of the original songs here, it's still a fine Steve Earle-style mid-tempo rocker.And then we come to what is not only the album's best song, it could be the song-writing and performance high point of Sugarland's career to date.  \"Little Wood Guitar\" is as perfect a composition as has come around in many years.  While stylistically akin to \"Coming Home,\" the song simply takes flight when Nettles reaches the chorus.  And again, it's hard not to see some truth in the story of the rather unassuming Christmas present that had the power to change a person's life.I guess the real revelation about GOLD AND GREEN is that it does not, for one moment, NOT feel like a Sugarland album.  This is no studio-mandated collection of cover songs designed to front-load the retail racks in time for Christmas.  It is what it is: A Sugarland Christmas album.  Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.008337108418345451}
{"text": "\"Gold and Green\" dishes up nothing but outstanding music from Sugarland! They sound better than ever on this album; and the arrangements for their holiday songs are highly creative and beautiful. Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush can write--and on this album they perform holiday songs both traditional and new. Listen for songs that have widespread appeal with lyrics about family, love and so much more of life. The CD also gets a lot of its strength from the way the tracks flow into one another; and that's grand. Sugarland sounds just great and the artwork is very pretty. This is definitely a must-have for their fans!\"City of Silver Dreams\" - This is a beautiful, poignant song with an elegant piano arrangement. It makes a great starter tune for the album. And wow, how Jennifer Nettles can SING!\"Winter Wonderland\" - Obviously, this is a traditional song; but Sugarland performs it with so much exceptional energy they can practically claim it as their own. That awesome country flavor works wonders for this classic ballad and they never miss a beat. The guitars sound particularly sweet; this'll get you up and dancing!\"Holly Jolly Christmas\" - This has more excellent words and music performed with a country twist by talented Sugarland. The guitars are just terrific and the slightly slower than normal tempo lets them put their own stamp on this song.\"Coming Home\" - This stuns me with its beauty; Sugarland delivers this with heart and soul--and just one listen proves it! The music fits in perfectly with those vocals, too.\"Gold and Green\" - The title track gets a lovely treatment; this handsome song is very easy on the ear and I think you're going to like this charming lullaby.\"Maybe Baby (New Year's Day)\" - Sugarland uses percussion, guitars and more to make this song sparkle brightly. This song is very beautiful indeed; and it deals with the topic of a man remembering a love affair. This is clearly a major highlight of this album.\"Nuttin' for Christmas\" - \"Nuttin' for Christmas\" is a cute, secular Christmas song that Sugarland aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing. It really wasn't all that easy; their talents carry them through.\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\" - This is a lovely interpretation of this classic Christmas song.\"Little Wood Guitar\" - This is a new song by Sugarland. What a great song this is--we hear the story of a little girl who received a guitar as her only Christmas present. Sugarland bats this right out of the ballpark.\"Silent Night\" - Sugarland ends their album with a crackerjack interpretation of this classic and ageless Christmas music. Kristian Bush and Jennifer Nettles sing this in both English and Spanish; and they never let go of a single superfluous note!Sugarland delivers an awesome holiday CD. I recommend this for Sugarland fans; and people who want a terrific country style holiday CD would do well to add this to their collections.\n", "val": 0.035286493599414825}

{"text": "Dead By Sunrise is a side project of Linkin Park's Chester Bennington. I would have to say that it's an amazing cd and there's no song that disappoints. I do believe that there will be some fans who purchase the cd based on Linkin Park's name and expect a similar sound to Linkin Park, but thankfully Bennington shows he can venture into a different genre of rock.If I had to put Dead By Sunrise into a genre it would be in the alternative rock section not the hard rock/metal category that it's currently in according to Amazon. It's not to say that Dead By Sunrise doesn't have songs that you could compare with Linkin Park either.I think one of the songs that shows this the best is Condemned and My Suffering where you will find Bennington's patented screams. Other then that I think you will have a much tougher time comparing the songs to Linkin Park, which may disappoint some.As for the songs I think the best song on the cd is Walking in Cirles. It's a slower song more ballad like then anything, but has excellent lyrics. I would also say that Let Down which also is more of a ballad than anything would be the second best song on the cd and its lyrics are just as good.Even with the differnt genre style of Dead By Sunrise it proves again in my mind why Chester has one of the best voices in rock music today. He can practically do any style and sound great while doing it! Excellent debut cd for Dead By Sunrise!\n", "val": 0.01638193428516388}
{"text": "\"Out of Ashes\" is the debut album from Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington's new band/solo act, Dead by Sunrise. Eschewing the rap-rock for some new wave and pop influences,  \"Out of Ashes\" teams Bennington up long-time collaborators and electro-rock outfit Julien-K (which, incidentally, features ex-Orgy members Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh) and producer Howard Benson.In all honesty, most of it sounds like it could be the sequel to \"Minutes to Midnight.\" It's exactly the kind of polished radio-rock you'd expect from producer Howard Benson, but that's not to say that it's bad. Actually, if you dug the balladry explored on the previously mentioned album, you're likely to be swept away by many of the softer tunes Chester and company break out on their debut affair. The gorgeous melodies of \"Give Me Your Name\" -- in spite of some cornball lyrics -- shows that the angsty young man who once penned the lyrical genius (ahem) that is \"Shut up when I'm talking to you!\" has grown quite substantially. Each of these songs -- many of which originated by Bennington strumming an acoustic guitar -- could be a hit in their own right, and show that outside of his safe zone, the man can actually write just simply good songs.In fact, most of the album can be appreciated on the most basic level, provided you can forgive the massive amount of gloss Benson applies to the material. Underneath the layers of synthesized guitar and keyboards, the songs stand strong on their own merits. Take for example, \"Let Down,\" a song that made its debut during the ReAct Now: Music & Relief concert in 2005. While the original, stripped down version was better, the song still sounds incredible and the emotion of the song -- as intended -- cuts right through you, despite the fact that it's been doctored to sound like an 80's pop throwback. Elsewhere, the album takes some turns that might appease the Linkin Park fan who was missing the more rocking element in the band's last affair, and on that end, \"My Suffering\" delivers.While the bulk of \"Out of Ashes\" resists the urge to break the mold, it's still a well-played and well-produced piece of music with more than a few gems to unearth. You don't even have to be a Linkin Park fan to appreciate the music here, and it's not a stretch to imagine a song or two from this album crossing over to a completely different audience altogether. At the end of day, these are good songs and deserve to be heard by an unbiased ear.\n", "val": 0.017328763380646706}

{"text": "So let's get this over quick.  This is essentially Linkin Park, but darker and with no rap.The good news is that if you like Chester in LP you will love him here.  Great range and vocals over the entire album and an interesting side of the screaming front man to one of my favorite bands.  So those that are worried don't be.  There isn't a stinker in the entire album and from start to finish it is a good listen.  You have some ups and downs (well, mostly downs) since this is a truly depressing album, but it is delivered in a way that will not immediately hit you as such.Much like LP tracks on the first 2 albums were about break-ups, heartache, and finding yourself through the flaws, yet somehow they rocked, the same is true here.  Despite the depressing subject matter, I had a good time with this album.  Some standouts include: \"Fire\", \"Crawl Back In\", \"Let Down\", \"Into You\", and \"Walking In Circles\".  Really though the album flows quite well and anyone in for some rock and decent radio friendly rock should give a listen.Now the bad news.  We've been here before.  \"Minutes To Midnight\" from LP was essentially a Chester Album, much like conversely Fort Minor's \"The Rising Tied\" was Mike Shinoda's album and time to shine.  See, since there wasn't that much Mike on \"M2M\", Chester who was predominately featured really rose to the occasion there.  He basically gave us everything he had and it shows here.  Nothing on this album besides a few clever hooks shows anything new from Chester and that is hard for me to admit.I am a huge LP fan and love their overall philosophy and style when it comes to writing and recording their various tracks.  This album, while technically great sounding and well produced, is extremely generic.  Sure there is some decent guitars and back beats from the drummer but honestly we have heard this before from Chester Bennington.  Those of us expecting a new direction or new style will be wholeheartedly mistaken.  As was my issue with \"The Rising Tied\", the parts are so much better when they are whole.Is it a bad album?  Of course not.  It is slickly produced and has some pretty good writing for the most part.  Is it groundbreaking?  The answer to that question as a firm NO.  So for fans of Bennington and LP in general this is a must buy since it really does sound a lot like LP due to Chester sticking with the same genre and overall same writing style.  The average listener of the Rock music will find something to like as well, just don't expect anything groundbreaking.\n", "val": 0.0019769121427088976}
{"text": "I've been a huge fan of Linkin Park ever since my teen years, and I have supported them by buying all of the albums. So, when I first heard that Chester Bennington is going to have his own project, I was really excited to see how will it turn out.I have to say that it blew my expectations, this album is just amazing! Chester has really grown as an artist, and his lyrics and melodies are very good. This particular album is composed as a life story. It has some light and dark moments. I will not give the full review on the music, because I think that it's a subjective theme, but I'm giving this album 5 star rating. My favorite song is \"Give Me Your Name\", the lyrics are very emotional and it shows Chester's softer side as a lyricist.The CD packaging is also great, inside the booklet you'll find various photos of the band members, taken form the promo photoshoot.Overall, Chester proved himself to be an amazing musician, not only he formed a group of artists from other great bands, but he also added a huge amount of his personality into this album. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested to hear good rock/alternative music. You will not be disappointed!\n", "val": 0.054275959730148315}

I've listened to the album all the way through about a dozen times now, and for the most part it is enjoyable enough. It's very musical, to the point where I can picture myself singing loudly in the car along to the tunes.However, also similar to my opinions about \"Minutes to Midnight\" though I grew to appreciate the album for what it was, I have realized that it did not live up to my expectations of what it would be. I was fortunate enough to see Linkin Park and Dead by Sunrise perform at the Epicenter '09 show, and what I saw there from Chester was much harder than what we have on this album. In the end what we have here is a very polished, very clean, and ultimately very pedestrian experience.That being said, it is supremely listenable and on par with Linkin Park's last effort.\n", "val": 0.02566862478852272}

{"text": "I may receive cheers or jeers for this review but Chester Bennington has made one of the BEST releases I have heard in a long time. Surprising & powerful, I would find it hard to believe that Chester was not a fan of Toadies \"Rubberneck\" & early 3 Doors Down many years back, as I hear influences of both throughout, & I love it. I've read this project was created to release some darker elements than the new alternative sound of LP. Well Toadies were certainly dark with a hint of Southern Rock infused in the music, much like \"Out of Ashes\". I am an LP fan but was, & I hate to say it, disappointed in LP's last 2 releases until I was able to separate the two genres in my mind admitting to myself they evolved from Rap/Rock to Alternative, then gave the 2 a few more listens & finally got it, as well as realized I liked them. I must admit though, my first taste of Iridescent about brought me to tears, & I am a 39 yo man tattooed head to toe, but I am not here to review LP, just added that to say this is NOT LP, nothing of the sort. This is a sound all it's own for Chester. So if you, as I, tremendously appreciated Toadies, this will give you that good dark feeling though different from what you might expect, not quite creepy like \"Rubberneck\", but otherwise just as moving. I hope this is not the end of Dead by Sunrise, but the beginning of what I may consider one of my favorite bands already! Chester, if you read this PLEASE give us more! As Perfect Circle was a brilliant ongoing project for Maynard, this has even more potential. Buy this now, it will become an instant favorite in your library. I hope this review was helpful but more importantly, informative.\n", "val": 0.02079392597079277}

{"text": "Dead by Sunrise, Chester Bennington's side project, was formed when he wanted to bring out a number of songs that he thought were \"darker and moodier\" than what he had done for Linkin Park. At first thought, that may sound like ironic motivation because Linkin Park's songs are well known for being moody. Just take a listen through Given Up or No More Sorrow and you will hear the angst and anger Linkin Park expresses in their songs, so if Chester says these songs are darker and moodier, there must be something to it.One listen-through, though, hints at the contrary. Songs like Let Down, Fire and Crawl Back In hold hope more than anything else.Take Fire, for example, lyrics like \"No need to hear your voice, or see your face to know that you are with me,\" are good words for those who misses a loved one, someone who may be fighting a war out there. It provides comfort in a hard-edged way and because of the rock rifts; it draws the listener into an emotional place where rock is a comfort rather than pointless noise. The same goes for Crawl Back In, the aptly titled song that represents the theme for the entire album. How Chester describes it as getting out of the funk of getting stoned and drunk all the time shows the introspective nature of the songs. How he wants out and to rise above the addictions, the evils accompanying them, is what this album is all about, and that is an admirable goal to have for an album of music.Well, some of the songs in here do have that embittered feel. Condemned sounds like a song one listens to feeling sorry for one's self, with self-depreciating lyrics like \"Treat me like an animal...\" This album isn't exactly the type to listen to when you are down, per se. Songs like Into You, however, have a balance in which they express some sort of relief or recovery from an otherwise low point. So it isn't bad when it comes down to the overall package, it does have a fairly unified theme of salvation and redemption.However, there seems to be a drag after a long listen through. Fire is a good start but it turns heavy come My Suffering, maybe even sooner. It doesn't help much when the grunge feel (intermingled with hard rock) becomes boring and mindless dj-vu for the Linkin Park listener that, after a couple of listens, it all feels like copious and cheap amounts of rock jumbled up for the sake of putting together an album, even while listening to the better songs. The other members, Ryan Shuck and the rest from Julien-K, did a good job playing their hearts out in every song, but unfortunately they don't provide much musical diversity. Adding to that would be the presence of Chester's vocals in every one of these songs. It would've been better if Mike Shinoda, Chester's partner in vocals for Linkin Park, did something here to keep the feel fresh.Verdict: Good grunge rock, but something you can really do without when it comes down to it, especially with bands like Coldplay or Maroon 5 around. The only reasons to get this album would be for the singles (Fire is fantastic), but don't expect a Zeppelin 5.\n", "val": 0.004047736991196871}

Chester's voice can be so tender on tracks like \"Let Down\" & \"Give Me Your Name\" and then he gives you that guttural sound from the pits of hell on \"My Suffering\". My favorite song is \"Walking In Circles\". This song is so haunting. The first thing I thought of when I heard it was the movie 2012. This would have been a great theme song for that movie.

I mean, why on earth did't they play it with a violin instead ?For the rest, it is a very original album, and it shurely reflects the impression that causes our culture. The inclusion of live sounds in a marketplace and of the \"carretonero\" buying old shoes and clothes, makes a specially beautiful ambiance.It is also an album with a very humorous approach.

The reviewer below who said this is a jarring CD was absolutely without a doubt mistaken about which CD he was reviewing.  This is by far the most accesible Kronos CD yet, with every track sweet to the ears.  It is a fanciful record of music from and inspired by Mexico.

Some of these tracks toy with the stereotypical elements of mariachi or chickenscratch.  Most of the songs are built on festive melodies, but a few tracks are more abstract and free form, one of which is a beautiful pastiche of recordings from around a Mexican cafe.  I put \"String\" in quotes because there is never a point where it sounds like just a bare string quartet; their instruments are always amplified, sometimes pedal distorted, and often joined by other instrumentalists, vocalists, and samples.

{"text": "Doubtless, the San Francisco-based Kronos Quartet, like virtually anyone living in urban California, has had years of exposure to Mexican popular music.  Mariachis, rancheras, pop styles and corridos percolate out of radios all across the state -- from open windows and door stoops, restaurants, truck cabs and worksites, Mexican music is a universal backdrop through much of the Southwestern US.  For the most part it's considered lowbrow and backwoodsy, sort of like country music was until just a few years ago, and outside of a few enthusiasts such as Arhoolie Records founder Chris Strachwitz, not many people in the North American mainstream have paid it much mind.  Kudos, then, to the ever-engaging Kronos Quartet, for recognizing the beauty of Mexico's melodies and working them into a new and enlightening tapestry of sound.  The Kronos ensemble has previously introduced Jimi Hendrix (and many other \"pop\" artists) into the modern classical/chamber music canon, but while compositions such as Silverstre Revuelta's \"Sensemaya\" or Belisario Garcia de Jesus's \"Cuatro Milpas\" are hardly as recognizable as \"Purple Haze,\" they are, bereft of that particular kitsch value, even more resonant in Krono's able hands.  The album opens with a sonically distorted, musically expansive version of the ranchera standard, \"El Sinaloense,\" the fiddles and strings filtered through a tinny haze that evokes the sound of the ... transistor radios that for decades have brought this music to the world at large.  The technological homage is brilliant, at once piquing our interest and acknowledging the populist roots of the style.  Other standards by famous Latin American composers such as Agustin Lara and Alberto Dominguez are also given a unique, Kronos-y twist.  The group has also gathered tunes from several of Mexico's more modern composers, such as Chalino Sanchez and Osvaldo Golijov, as well as lounge music icon Esquivel and rock en espanol supergroup Cafe Tacuba, whose producer Gustavo Santaolalla helped define the album's sound.  It's an impressive effort, bringing overdue attention to the serious, substantive side of Mexico's musical heritage... Not that anyone South of the border needed any convincing, mind you... they've been digging this stuff all along!\n", "val": 0.012576298788189888}

However considering that before this the only exposure to the music of Mexico I had was the Mexican Hat Dance this was an enlightening experience.

{"text": "This is a Marduk album, no questions about it.  While not a paint-by-numbers effort, it does sound very familiar...though there are some ghastly secrets hidden behind the expected formula!  From the get-go, this is super-high quality hideousness, as we've come to expect from this incarnation of Marduk; this album does not really have any \"filler\" or any songs that seem to drag on too long (as several of their albums are guilty of); the whole thing seems to go by rather quickly and urges one to play it again.  There are some unexpectedly grandiose moments in several songs, where a triumphal guitar MELODY/riff intrudes in the miasma of chainsawing (\"Into Utter Madness\" and \"Whorecrown\" most notably, although the latter has an ongoing dissonance which perhaps heightens the impact of the melody when it arrives); that is a new facet we are introduced to with \"Wormwood\"--- melody(although Marduk HAS had instances of it througout their catalogue)!  Don't be shocked, however...Morgan manages to keep it extremely morbid and well-fitting within the context of Marduk's usual whirlwinds of doom.  Another sonic addition is the very audible (and integral to many songs) BASS, which is remarkable in the world of Black MeTal(perhaps having something to do with Devo's hand in the production of the album?)!  This album has a crisp, crackling sound with very dark undertones...in my opinion, it has the best production of the Mortuus-era albums; not widely different, but noticeable.  Speaking of Mortuus, his vocals hit another plateau of excellence, with some impossibly weird noises being introduced to Marduk's sound (getting closer to his work in Funeral Mist, but not that maniacally over-the-edge).  There is a bit of an \"experimental\" song(\"Unclosing the Curse\"), or perhaps an \"interlude\", if you prefer.  It is suitably creepy, and not really annoying like some other bands' similar type of devices the break up albums' flow(nothing at all like 1349's failed experiment of earlier this year).  There is even a creeping, slow song (which is seasoned with some of Morgan's guitar melodies, used as a recurring motif), the aptly-titled \"Funeral Dawn\".  My favourite track on here is \"A Chorus of Cracking Necks\", with it's snazzy sing-along chorus(ha ha ha!), complete with sickening sound effects!  Oddly, the main early riff of \"Into Utter Madness\" is similar to one of the main riffs in \"Cracking Necks\".  I must mention the spectacular booklet with some EXTREMELY disturbing artwork/photos (where do they keep digging these up?)! \"Wormwood\" is a masterpiece of Black MeTal, perfectly (de)composed, paced, and performed...a MUST for any fan of Marduk, and an excellent example of what BM should be(also,it includes the best use of fly-buzzing I've ever heard)!\n", "val": 0.003007157938554883}

The drums sound like real drums, the vocals are loud and harsh, the guitars are live-like. I'm sure everyone has their own preference of which era of Marduk they like best. If you are one of those who like the last two releases then you'll definitely dig this one as well.\n", "val": 0.015080121345818043}

In this rendition of \"singing bowls\" they pass for bowl sounds but at higher volume one can detect the a difference in the actual character of the bowls and recognize the telltale sign of the synthesizer.  Hopefully you will get an opportunity to actually hear an ensemble of Buddhist using the authentic bowls for meditation purposes and not for entertainment.  A significant difference in sound is that the striking of the bowl is minimized and the emphasis of in the tone produced by \"stirring\" the striker around the rim actually produces the harmonics that can continue indefinitely.  At higher volume the harsh abrupt intense tone sounds much more appropriate for a bell.  Bells are also used to variable degrees in Buddhism and Hinduism and many other religions.  The \"singing bowl\" established a significant hold in the USA with the Flower Children and the New Age religious movement.  The actual bowls are limited in number as they were all handmade and harmonically tuned by highly skilled master craftsman utterly devoted to their task.  Enjoy this album for what it is, an attempt to simulate instruments that were designed and constructed exclusively for sacred mediation and use them to play music that will entertain us.  It actually is entertaining.\n", "val": 0.010473165661096573}

These two tracks are identical to the two tracks on a different CD which is also sold on Amazon. The other CD's title and cover along with the 2 track names on it are different from this one but the music is exactly identical on both CD's. The other CD/version was dated 2006. This version (by '33 Bowls'), is dated 2010. On the other CD which is titled \"Tibetan Singing Bowl\" by 'Music For Deep Meditation', the tracks are titled 'Gong Meditation' and 'Singing Bowl Meditation'. The price of the other CD (identical music) is $15.04 compared to this one for $9.68.  Interesting.As far as the actual music content goes, great, I have no issues with it and obviously I like it as I have now bought it twice.

It was an hour long drive and I still had at least a half hour to go.  I was starting to plan on stopping for a pee break.  Then I 'decided' to 'witness' this experience from the point of view of 'the observer'.  So, I noticed that I was also feeling aroused (nothing too unusual there.... especially lately).  The scenario was, I was driving down the highway with my cruise control set at 79 and I was listening to 33's Tibetan Singing Bowls recording called \"morning\".  The pain transformed into absolute pleasure.  The sexual energy engulfed me.  Maybe infused is a better word.  You know that deep dropping-like sensation you get in your pelvic biel area just about the time you're going to orgasm?  And my breathing changed too....  Meanwhile, there's traffic and construction happening.  All I wanted was to drive forever and let this energy do its thing.  I didn't have a orgasm... but it didn't matter.... it felt so good!  And when I finally got to pee.... oh lord..... I peed and peed and peed!  Ha!  :D\n", "val": 0.00032918917713686824}

I have done so, being in a group of about 20 people, in a small 11 foot yurt, with about 25 singling bowls and Crystal bowls going at the same time! It is an amazing experience and the sound and vibration really take you to another place, difficult to describe the sheer joy and exhilaration in words.What I LOVE about this CD is that the sounds are crisp and clean, and with the right ear buds, you can come very close to re-creating actually being in the presence of these bowls. The effect is lessened significantly by NOTwearing ear phones or buds, but still quite enjoyable.I gave it only 4 stars for 2 reasons: FIRST: There are 2 tracks on the CD and I find I greatly prefer the Morning song over the rain song. It would have been nice to have a little more variety, and maybe have shorter tracks. I pretty much only listen to the 1 track.SECONDLY: My fianc finds this CD grates on his nerves. I believe that is because he has not had an experience with the bowls personally. Listening to it objectively, I can understand how someone who is not familiar with the bowls may find the wobbling, chiming, gonging, vibrating less than heavenly.To each his own, I am very happy with my purchase!\n", "val": 0.009001797996461391}

{"text": "The 33 Bowls sound is exquisite.  I design, engineer, and produce entrainment tracks professionally for companies who market them as their own.  If you are someone who has ever worked with brainwave entrainment before, you have almost certainly heard some of my work.  The thing that 33 Bowls gets right is to use recordings in their more raw form.  In my productions, I have worked with traditional healers from Tibet who utilize singing bowls.  The way you hear bowls played on 33 Bowls is very much the way you would hear bowls played if you were to be treated by a healer in Tibet.Purely digital recordings produced in a studio sound overly sterile.  In fact, when mastering many such recordings, the engineer often applies analogue filters in an effort to put back some of the harmonics and \"imperfections\" found naturally in raw recordings.  I use natural sounds in my own works wherever possible, some of which have \"imperfections\" in them.  These are, in my professional judgement, far more organic and natural to the ear than the sterile approach used in purely digital creations.So, expect the odd sound here and there in 33 Bowls, just as you would expect the occasional sound that arises in the environment wherever you listen to music.  Unless you live in a soundproof box, you will have ambient noises that interject themselves into your listening from time to time.  For the most part, our ears simply incorporate these into the overall listening experience with very little notice paid to them.  The same will be true of the 33 Bowls recordings if the listener gives them half a chance.Setting aside the ambient sound artifacts for a moment, 33 Bowls has been recorded exceptionally well.  It is surprisingly difficult to achieve lengthy recordings of singing bowls that are smooth and consistent in sound quality.  I have recorded them myself, and can attest to this fact from experience.  I can only imagine how many attempts it must have taken to get bowl recordings of this length and quality.Tibetan bowls are among a select group of percussion instruments which produce sounds that have an enormous range of harmonics in them.  Of all the instruments I have recorded, only the didgeridoo comes even close to a well made Tibetan singing bowl in terms of the harmonics it produces.  The tones of singing bowls are currently being used by some major university hospitals (sorry, names are not permitted,) for a variety of purposes, such as the recovery of surgical patients, and in cancer treatments.  The exact mechanism by which they are thought to facilitate treatments and recovery is not known, but some researchers believe it is related to their richness in harmonics.  Time will tell if this turns out to be the case or not.  The unprocessed sounds of the bowls in 33 Bowls reproduces these harmonics almost as well as being there when the bowls were played.  I can only suppose they would act as support in fostering a natural healing environment, though as noted, this has not yet been proven conclusively.So, to the producers of 33 Bowls, my hat is off to you.  This was a job very well done.  And to any potential purchaser, 33 Bowls has my heart-felt recommendation.\n", "val": 0.004618787206709385}

{"text": "Among the growing number of excellent recordings of Tibetan singingbowls,33 Bowls soars and stands out as a  sonic masterwork.This is understatement, rather than hyperbole, as Hans'compositions, deeply intuitive and spiritual as they are, are subtly structuredlike a musical Pythagorean braid, imbued with as much Reason as feeling.What I perceive is not another talented New Age dilettante creating trancemusic to zone out the listener, but a brilliant composer and technician whosemastery of the intellectual, physical, and spiritual aspects of music has createdworks that will delight those seeking \"vibrational medicine\" as well as thosewho appreciate \"classical\" music. The production itself is technicallyflawless: tonal resonance and a quiet, almost fugal complexity underlie the soothingoceanic flow of sound. And this comes forth with crystal clarity.  Others have produced excellentrecordings with the bowls, but Hans plays these with a deep respect for their soundand their antiquity, evoking (and invoking) past masters of these sacred instruments. Withthese recordings, he becomes a living part of that lineage. [As wonderful as the MP3version is, the HDCD version is even more astonishing.

{"text": "I became a fan of Kutless back when Sea of Faces came out back in 2004. Their rock sound was a welcomed find for me as I discovered the world of Christian rock. In 2005, they released Strong Tower, a worship album that combined a did a great job combining a rock sound with some familiar and new worship tunes. To this day, the song \"Strong Tower\" remains one of my favorite worship songs.After a couple less-than-overwhelming rock releases the past few years, the guys have once again returned to the worship genre with the release of It Is Well: A Worship Album. While the album doesn't always hit on all cylinders, the band's take on some traditional and well-known songs, as well as a few of their originals, combine to make this a very solid addition to the worship genre. I really think these guys do worship better than straight-up rock, actually.The album opens with the title track, using a recording of a person walking into a church where the choir is singing the song to transition from the traditional to the modern. It works well, and when Jon Micah Sumrall launches into the chorus (with the melody changed ever so slightly), it sounds amazing. Other familiar songs that work well here include \"Hungry,\" \"Remember Me,\" \"God of Wonders,\" \"Give Us Clean Hands,\" and \"Redeemer,\" which uses part of the hymn \"There Is A Redeemer\" extremely well (although I wish it was much longer and repeated the verse structure more than once).I know what you're thinking: Do we really need another version of \"God of Wonders?\" That was my first thought, but the band is really able to make it their own for the most part. Instead of reminding me of earlier versions, it just reminded me why I enjoyed the song so much in the first place.The original songs weren't really anything all that special. Pretty much your typical worship fare. The current single, \"What Faith Can Do,\" explores the power of faith and what God is able to accomplish through it, and sounds made for K-LOVE radio. \"Taken By Love\" is another solid tune, and \"You Save Me\" turns up the rock sound more than most on this album. I don't think they were able to come up with a \"Strong Tower\" on this album, however.This album really made me wish that Kutless would just do an album of all traditional hymns and update them with a Kutless style. \"Redeemer\" and \"It Is Well\" are easily the two best songs on the album (\"Remember Me\" is close, though). That verse structure on \"Redeemer,\" with it's fantastic guitar riff accompanying the familiar tune, built perfectly into the chorus, forcing me into praise of God. Hearing an old hymn given that treatment was fantastic, and I would love to hear more of that from Kutless if they ever choose to do another worship album (and if it's done that way, I'll pre-order it now).This album, although not perfect, does a great job of combining the worship style with Kutless' familiar rock sound and is a worthy addition to the genre.\n", "val": 0.021425029262900352}
{"text": "The fall of 2009 has been an exciting time for Christian music fans. Tons of new cd's from popular artsits have flooded the shelves and while some are good most seem to be trading away their Christian themes for more mainstream friendly love/emotion songs. Not so with Kutless. The rockers from Portland OR have crafted yet another great CD and have added a fine addition to their worship repitoire. This CD is just as good as Strong Tower if not better and the mix of hymns, worship choruses, and Kutless original songs are very well produced and recorded. I was blown away by the title track! It almost seemed to have a David Crowderish electric thing to it but the soaring rock chorus is definitely Kutless. This CD is worth every penney.\n", "val": 0.04184432700276375}
{"text": "It's hard to go wrong with Kutless. The only album I really didn't like was Hearts of the Innocent. These guys bring it on all their albums and this one is no different. Its solid. The only problems I had was the first half wasn't as good as the second half. In my oppinion the second half really overshines the first half. Maybe because the first half is slower than the second half. Also sadly I didn't like the remake of It Is Well. Its my favorite hymn but their version had too much going on so I really couldn't feel it. I'm not anti-remake, I've heard a lot of good remakes of it. Although I'm not a big fan of the other songs they covered on this album, I thought their take made them better and more enjoyable. As for the bands original songs on this album I thought they were top notch either musically or lyically with most of them combining both. In conlusion, I hope Kutless keeps to the current line up they've been doing on their cds with the 2 rock albums then a worship album. Its awesome hearing my favorite bands singing the songs i sing and have loved for so long.\n", "val": 0.0017291075782850385}

I was expecting the cd to sound very similar to 'Strong Tower', which isn't a bad thing since that cd was incredible.While this is still in worship mode, the sound is very different and the band pulls it off extremely well. The best thing I can say about the cd is that it will definitely draw you nearer to God and will pull you into a worship frame of mind while still having a rock flavor to the music.My personal favorites are the title track (what an original way to record this classic hymn), Amazed, What Faith Can Do, Everything I Need, and Give Us Clean Hands.As always, the original lyrics are very personal and genuine as these rockers continue to humble themselves in praise for our Almighty God. Kutless fans will drink this in and new listeners will be back for more. Excellent cd.\n", "val": 0.039091549813747406}

I think this was far better than their first worship album, Strong Tower, which in my opinion was pretty good itself. This album has so much more emotion though and to me is so much more powerful too. I also like that they actually have some of their own songs on this album. It is hard to pick a favorite because they are all so good. There wasn't one song that i wanted to skip. I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. The only disappointing part was when the last song ended. I didn't want the album to end. Oh well, I guess all good things must come to an end. Anyway, Kutless fans, or Christian rock fans in general, pick this album up. You will not be disappointed.\n", "val": 0.019394930452108383}

The main thing I love about this album is that while they still maintain a decent amount of hard-rocking sounds, they still keep a reverence that I have not seen in other bands' albums that try to do what they do. Even with the riffs, solos and hard sounds, there is still a high level of reverence that I find the best part of it.On the overall, an amazing album. I have listened to it so much, I have memorized all the words to each song!

An excellent collaboration of classic worship music blended with modern rock.I was still skeptical, however, since I have been disappointed with much of the Christian rock I have heard. I expected maybe a couple more good songs, but instead found a solid album that is listenable and likable all the way through. It is both upbeat and God-centered, the latter of which I often find absent from modern Christian music (which tends to focus on \"me\" and what God can do for \"me me me.\"My favorite is the closing track, \"I'm Still Yours,\" a slow-paced, deep and sentimental song that I can listen to day after day (not a common trend for me)which reminds us just how much we need to rely on God, even in the worst of it.

I can be working away with the music in the background and when some of the songs queue up, they just grip me and I find myself overwhelmed with how awesome God is. From the high-octane power chords driving the grand and triumphant old hymn \"It is well\" to the soaring lyrics of \"Amazed\" that unfurl breathtaking pictures of God's sheer grandeur, making me just stop and agree: \"Lord, you are awesome, awesome, awesome. Thank You for being so awesome, to me, to everybody, to all creation.\" Few songs have this kind of impact -- stopping me dead in my tracks and just overwhelming me with just how good God is, making me glad in just contemplating it.There's not a bad track on the album. All are solid and some downright amazing. \"Amazed,\" \"It is Well,\" \"Remember Me,\" \"Give us Clean Hands,\" and \"Everything I Need\" will lodge themselves in your brain and echo through your everyday humdrum for weeks -- washing the dishes, brushing your teeth, etc. You'll be humming and singing in the most mundane and random moments ... and smiling.I couldn't recommend this album more.\n", "val": 0.03624149039387703}

The problem is that the band set such a high standard with the previously mentioned CD, that it would be hard for almost anything to compare.There are some very strong tracks on this.  I particularly love the remakes of the old well known hymn, 'It Is Well' and 'Give Us Clean Hands'.  Two other top notch songs are 'Amazed' and 'What Faith Can Do'.This is certainly worth getting.

{"text": "I listened with eager anticipation when a friend lent me this CD - could it possibly be the holy grail: true hard rock, true hymns?  Alas, the disappointment set in from the first track.  It's not that it sounds bad, or that Kutless didn't do a good job.  It's simply that the album was not nearly so unique as the liner notes suggested.Probably the best covers on the album are \"Hungry\" and \"Give us clean hands\" - these songs can get a bit tedious when sung in corporate worship if they are not led by skilled musicians and worship leaders, and Kutless succeed in making them very singable whilst keeping the tempo up.  The originals on the album are solid tracks.  However, the more familiar tracks (especially \"It is well with my soul\" and \"God of wonders\") have some rather perplexing chord progressions that remove colour from the accompaniment, and make it much harder to sing along.Overall, i found \"It is well\" listenable but not remarkable, solid but not brilliant, fresh but not unique.

{"text": "despite the fact that Kutless has two or three new members, they still sound like the same band they were in 2004 with \"Sea of Faces\". there are two songs that I remember on this album. one is \"It Is Well\", which I sung at church, and the other is \"God of Wonders\", again which I sung at church. however, I enjoyed the rest of the songs as well. the song \"What Faith Can Do\" almost sounds like \"Revelation Song\" at the beginning. this is a strong release by Kutless and if you have some money, you should buy it.\n", "val": 0.044725451618433}

But \"What Faith Can Do\" is the best song on the album.  This is a very inspirational song about when you fall you will have the strength to rise.  As a lot of you know Third Day did a Worship album called Offerings II and they did \"God Of Wonders\" live and although Kutless doesn't do it live they still I think are just a little better.This is a great well rounded album with a lot of inspirational songs.\n", "val": 0.06038742512464523}

Of all five tracks, I have to say I was a little confused by the addition of \"Well All Right\", being a Buddy Holly tune.  Holly died years before 1969... But the Garza Bros did the song justice nonetheless.  My first impression was a good one, listening to Santana's \"Evil Ways\".  I was glad they didn't take too much creative license with the song, out of respect for Carlos, of course.  I really have to say they put their own unique signature on each one of the tunes on this CD.  \"She Came In Thru The Bathroom Window\" was amazing and nostalgic.  Tony Joe White's \"Polk Salad Annie\" I think was the one song I was most impressed with.  It's hard to follow T.J. White, but it was done with total respect to his genre and back-woodsy Southern style.  The last track, \"Roadhouse Blues\" had me dancing like I had good sense...I'm a \"sorta old\" lady... I don't dance that much anymore.  What a joy it was to listen to a reprise of great music given the proper respect by these 21st Century musical geniuses!! Kudos to my Texas home boys!

LLB can play nearly anything but I agree with RKocham that this release feels like a \"stop gap\" to prolong putting out their next album.  The first album, \"Los Lonely Boys\", is a classic and they deserved all the accolades.  It seems LLB is at an impasse.  Will they keep their roots of rock/blues/tejano or will they go mainstream commercial?  It will be interesting to see what they produce under the new label. \"1969\" is good, not great.

I won't go through all the songs, and as a previous reviewer said, won't really win them any new fans. These covers sound good, have the trademark LLB sound on them, with those wonderful vocal harmonies. I don't understand why on the PIT website why Sacred is not even mentioned (except as the follow-up album to the self-titled release). I thought Sacred was a pretty solid release save for the filler tracks, Texican Style, One More Day, and Outlaws. Yet, the PIT website sings the praises of Forgiven, and tries to promote that album (?) Forgiven was a failure save for only having three \"decent\" songs being Heart Won't Tell A Lie, I'm A Man, and Cruel IMHO. Let's hope their new album will have them going in a direction that LLB want to go (like on their 1st album), and have free reign over doing what they want, and not what some big major label wants them to do...like Forgiven, and Chistmas $pirit!\n", "val": 7.240677223308012e-05}

{"text": "1969 is an EXCELLENT set of covers by Los Lonely Boys. The group sounds as good as they ever did; and the arrangements and the mixing couldn't be any better on this EP. Every one of these five tunes is a classic and Los Lonely Boys put their own stamp on all five of them using a few key and tempo changes here and there plus some mighty special vocals; and it all works very well. I love it!The EP album opens with Los Lonely Boys doing a great job on Santana's \"Evil Ways.\" The guitars are awesome and these guys make this tune electric with a rendition that ups the tempo just a little that amazingly adds quite a bit of extra energy to this tune. The Garza brothers really do this one up right--hey, is that Santana I see getting jealous?\"Well Alright,\" a number written by Buddy Holly, Norman Petty, Jerry Allison and Joe B. Maudlin, gets the royal treatment from Los Lonely Boys--and wow, what a great effect this has! There's a noticeable Latin flavor added to some awesome rockin' music with those guitars and drums especially. Now THIS is great music! There's also a fantastic cover of The Beatles' \"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window;\" Los Lonely Boys yet again score a huge goal by taking this and mixing it up just a bit with a Latin flavor--and they play with the tempo and keys just enough to keep it quite strong in their own way. The Beatles would have approved!\"Polk Salad Annie\" rocks as Los Lonely Boys perform this tune originally written and recorded by Tony Joe White and later re-recorded by the great Elvis Presley. \"Polk Salad Annie\" leaves little to be desired as Los Lonely Boys do this to perfection! Their sense of timing and that really cool arrangement make this a winning number yet again. The EP ends very well with Los Lonely Boys doing \"Roadhouse Blues;\" this is an electric number that rocks--it also makes me cry out for MORE!Los Lonely Boys turned out an excellent EP with 1969. Andy Johns also did his usual outstanding job when he mixed these tracks. I highly recommend this for fans of this group; and it's so good that even if you're not a fan already you may want to consider picking this one up or downloading it soon.\n", "val": 0.058468159288167953}

This is a Rockwell painting come to life, it is not some kind of ironic commentary on the past... it is a memorial to the past. Dylan does this perfectly. It baffles me, but I really think this will turn out to be one of his most memorable records.Let me venture to say that this is also a vocal masterpiece. Forget those low-quality clips on amazon.com.. when you hear this the way Bob Frost intended it, you will curse yourself for ever cursing it.And surprisingly, there are no real low points. It is just raw and perfect from \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" to \"Little Town of Bethlehem.\" It makes you think of a bright, white, hopeful day.

{"text": "Bob Dylan is the artist that some people love to hate and other people love to love.  He is arguably the most important cultural figure of the 20th century, or at least the last half of it, single-handedly changing everything about popular music from the length of songs to their subject matter to the way they are sung, yet some refuse to give him credit for any of these things or for the many great songs and albums he's created, dismissively complaining \"he can't sing!\" and leaving it at that.  There are also those who will defend him to the death after a lousy concert performance (and there have been many, especially since around 2010 or so) or an ill-conceived idea like the recent \"Sinatra\" albums or his odd behavior on his final \"The Late Show with David Letterman\" performance.  Even Dylan himself in his 2012 \"Rolling Stone\" interview lamented, \"Why is it that when people talk about me they have to go crazy?\"I try to be more rational in my discussions of Dylan and have felt the wrath of Dylan fans and haters alike on various internet forums.  As I write this, there are 458 reviews of Christmas in the Heart posted by others, and the only reason I think that mine is necessary is just to give a little different take on why I like it.I do like this album.  It has a nice old-timey feel to it.  I like the traditional arrangements and the production, the latter an area where Dylan hasn't been given enough credit since he started producing his own albums, beginning with \"Love and Theft,\" under the nom de plume Jack Frost.  Those who complain about Dylan's singing on this one miss the point.  Christmas songs are like folk songs - they're for EVERYBODY to sing, not just the sweet-voiced among us.  The Earth is 4.5 billion years old, but how old is the phonograph?  Or the radio?  How long have these things been commonplace in homes?  It's maybe only the last 80-90 years or so that we've been paying professionals to do our singing for us.  Previously, if you wanted to hear a song, you sung it yourself, or your family sat around singing it.  That's how the tradition of folk song, in which Dylan is grounded, started - and of course, families and friends gathered to sing Christmas carols as well.So if Dylan's voice isn't so great on this album (and it's not), that's OK with me, as he's just carrying on a folk tradition that says anybody can sing these songs.  If, for your tastes, he sounds too much like your great uncle after one too many egg nogs, that's fine, as there are plenty of good Christmas albums by the likes of Bing Crosby, Tony Bennett, and Peggy Lee to recommend.  I for one miss my great uncles.\n", "val": 0.0003098412125837058}

If you are waltzing on to amazon.com thinking you are saying something new by making fun of his voice or telling people who like it they're deluded, let me remind you that there are more than 300 million people in the U.S. alone and your insight is one tiny grain of sand on that beach.

If that's what you are looking for, steer clear of this album.  What it lacks in smoothness is made up by the sincerity in his gnarly sounding voice. And to be fair, his voice doesn't sound too different from Louis Armstrong's gravely voice. Or Willie Nelson's gravely twang.  I have to believe, as well,  that he did these songs with a twinkle in his eye, that's this is all a bit of a joke, but not a malicious joke. I think he may have worked some extra roughness into his voice just to ramp up the textures of his anti-singing. (Maybe he smoked a pack of cigs before recording for instance) The music and backup vocals are done so perfectly and cleanly that i think it was his intention to play his nearly shot voice off of this.  I think the shot voiced though sincere effort gives this album a certain charm that one doesn't get from a smooth voiced crooner Christmas album.  Yes, there are some cringe worthy moments, but I have found this album has grown on me over time and puts me into the Christmas mood better than most other Christmas albums i have.\n", "val": 0.016367396339774132}

Recently, the kids told me that they wanted to give some Christmas music to their mother ( who generally hates Christmas music) for Christmas.  Then I accidentally stumbled across this CD, which i knew she would like.  So, we bought it for her.  And, because of Amazon Music,  I'm able to stream it for myself.  It's a fun album!  It sounds sincere and joyful.  It is both traditional and off the beaten track, an appealing combination (for me, at least).  If you're just buying it to experience Dylan for the first time, I'd start somewhere else, perhaps \" Blood on the Tracks\" or \"Highway 61 Revisited.\"\n", "val": 0.03288355842232704}

Or not.This appears to be a very heartfelt effort and I find it endearing and, as another reviewer put it, comforting and nostalgic.Part of the endearing quality is that Dylan would dare to lend his voice to this genre.

His rendition of Adeste Fideles (usually one of my favorite Christmas carols) sounds kinda lousy.  But, after years of producers turning \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" into something so overwrought as to be the musical equivalent of EZ-Cheese, I enjoy Dylan's simple home-cooked version of it.Not everything on the album is good, and it will certainly disappoint if you're looking for the most aurally pleasing Christmas album out there.  But, if you're a Dylan fan who can take it on its own terms, I think it can actually rekindle some of the fun of Christmas tunes...

His whispery delivery on \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" is exactly how the song should be rendered. \"Christmas Blues\" and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas are right down his alley.

Though the structure is same as the originals he does spice it up a bit with his own style modestly. Though these songs very well have a classic 40s and 50s sound. His voice really ain't bad. He is old and raspy he sounds like a white Louie Armstrong to me. But you can tell Bob is trying his best...trying his best to still be Bob Dylan as well. Occasionally through the raspyness you can hear hits of like pre 90s Dylan when he was a bit younger. Dylan seems quite mysterious as ever and even on the grumpyish side these days rarely giving interviews and what not. So it is nice and sweet hearing him sing these cheerful classic Christmas songs.

I bought this album because I like Bob Dylan, and because I like to have christmas albums from different artists. Simple as that. So how is it, this new christmas album of mine? It is probably what you can expect from an artist like Bob Dylan. It's slightly odd,funny,and very enjoyable. It seems to me that Mr. Dylan has taken a liking to musical influences from the forties lately. Just listen to the background singers. It sounds to me like the recordings were done in one big room with everybody performing at once. Making the tracks sound very organic and alive, and if I may say so a little bit scruffy. (It's Bob Dylan for heaven's sake. What did you expect?)I have only given the album four stars out of five, becase there's two tracks I could have done without. \"The Christmas Blues\" because I think it's boring, and \"Must Be Santa\". For some reason I don't like the insistent energy of the track together with the rest of the album. On the other hand, there's tracks I really love here. Just listen to Mr. Dylan perform \"I'll Be Home For Christmas\". Unbelieveable!So who would I recommend this album to? Anyone who like Bob Dylan obviously, and everyone who's looking for a Christmas album that are slightly different,yet familiar still. It does not hurt to have a sense of humor about it either. I'm pretty sure Mr. Dylan himself has had fun when making this album, and why is there a picture of nude model legend Betty Page on the inner sleeve, wearing a Christmas outfit? This album is great,odd,and funny all the way it seems. Wait until it's late at night Christmas eve, when the kids have gone to bed, and you're entering that reflective mood.

Generally I could deal with Dylan only when sung by other people, so I can't believe I'm enjoying other people's songs sung by Dylan! Not sure if it's because of Bob or in spite of him that this works, but I'm recommending it. (That said, I admit I'm getting a big kick out of others' pans of this, and they have some valid points.)The first thing you will think is, \"Why?? This is some kind of joke, right?\" But after a few listens I am convinced that he's playing it straight. Just look at the picture on the cover. Like something from Norman Rockwell.The even more polka'd up take on Brave Combo's inspired arrangement of \"It Must Be Santa\" is a delight, and I have no need to search for a better version of that. He actually did a video for this - check it out because it's very fun. I think he looks better with that mop on his head than he's looked all his life. My second favorites here are \"Christmas Blues\" and \"Little Drummer Boy.\" The latter is done the way I like it - in a male voice...with drums! Dylan somehow seems to have changed his voice on this track - it sounds smoother, and I think I would even count this among my favorite versions of the song.I think I can hear ice clinking in a drink during \"Christmas Blues,\" and at one point in \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" it sounds like he's gargling phlegm, but I guess if Bob Dylan doesn't want to do another take, no one can make him. But he really does sound like he's trying for once.Why would he do this? I think that Bob just has a genuine, sincere wish for you and yours to have a good Christmas.\n", "val": 0.001252902438864112}

I listened with low expectations.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised, and have been listening to it over and over.  For me, the music is a reflection of Christmas the way it should be . . . heart-felt, uncommercial, not sugar coated.  It has a kind of in-your-face effect, so typical of Bob, but so atypical of most of the Christmas music that's out there.  I loved it.  All of the best Christmas church hymns are included, and they are done with such honesty.  All of the songs reinforce that Christmas is about the birth of Jesus, and people being happy as a result.  You can tell the songs are being sung by a man who truly believes. It's Christmas In the Heart.\n", "val": 0.029835570603609085}

{"text": "I bought this album almost two years ago - just after Christmas, my first Christmas as a Bob Dylan listener actually.Pretty rough sounding voice, but I like his voice, and I've long been fascinated with his belief in Jesus and God, and so I heard quite a bit of sincerity in his raspy voice as he sought to sing (ahem) these songs.A coworker of mine, a music aficionado respectful of Dylan but not one who likes his voice, thought Christmas in the Heart was just too horrible to listen to.  Apparently she bought the album around the same time as I (n.b., I think I loaned her mine for a listen and she forgot and thought it was hers), and she later traded it in at a local used book & CD megastore.  Horrible, awful sounding it was.Every Christmas now, a couple of us Dylan fans in the office bring the matter up as if it's one of the truly great Christmas albums (she loves Christmas music and knows a lot of it) and then listen to her mild cursing of it.  Office banter and fun.  I e-mail her reviews of the album that I think she'll like.  She liked the one in which the author - who personally found a lot of good stuff in the album- acknowledged that it's not for everyone, and he concluded by saying one could use it as a sort of music fruitcake; that is, bring it out and put in on when you want your party guests to start leaving.So, over at my parents (who are in their 70s) this Christmas, after I hooked up their stereo so it could stream music from the web, I set up a few Pandora radio stations with Christmas music.  Like, Christmas general, classical, and Louis Armstrong Holiday, Jimmy Durante and so forth.  That was the music.  Until my brother arrived and at the dinner table decided to override the Pandora stream with his own Rhapsody stream - just to see if he could do it, which he did.  It irritated me, 'cause I'd worked pretty hard to set up genres my parents liked.Oh no, he had the gall to find Dylan's Christmas in the Heart and started the album from the beginning.  Oh gosh, how long 'til the complaints shut it down.  Well, indeed, my niece (age 16, also a music lover) commented, \"his voice always sounds bad, but this is especially bad.\"But to my surprise, my mom (the more musically savvy of my parents) enjoyed the songs quite a bit.  Jimmy Durante, Louis Armstrong, Bob Dylan I guess.  Wow, miracles do happen...I found somebody new who likes the Dylan Christmas in the Heart.You never know, you just might like it.He works so hard (well it sounds like it) to sing some of the most meaningful lines - meaningful in the sense of the essential worship of Christmas - that I gotta believe he is, as he said in a related interview, a true believer.Thanks, Bob, for your music.  And to those reading, give this album a try if you can stand a gravelly, raspy sounding voice, and then wonder at the miracle of the Christ in the heart of a man.\n", "val": 0.00015376595547422767}
{"text": "I'm a fan. I like all of his stages. I even like most of \"Self Portrait.\" I listen to his albums since \"Time Out of Mind\" regularly, so its not his voice (and with Bob, one can never assume that the sound of his voice on a particular album is his real voice). I even seen him recently in concert (September 2011) and thoroughly enjoyed it. But this album, as an album, is really bad. And such a waste. I mean, with the voice he uses on this album, we could have had a truly spectacularly melancholic or wise selection of songs and arrangements (think Marianne Faithfull's \"Easy Come Easy Go\"). Indeed, there is a hint of this in \"The Christmas Blues.\" But what we get instead is, on many tracks, what sounds like karaoke versions of songs with standard arrangements (albeit played by a crackerjack band) and backup singers who sound like the ones on the worst songs from \"Self Portrait.\" And then there are the tracks that frustrate in their failure. Listen to \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\" This is the most pathetic, ironic, and sarcastic \"Christmas song\" in the repertoire. Watch Judy Garland sing this to the actress playing her sister in \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" as she struggles to keep it together while the little girl is, herself, crying and you'll know exactly why it is also one of the most misinterpreted songs there is. Even Dylan's restoration of \" we'll have to muddle through somehow,\" while admirable, does not make up for the bizarre phrasing. Which is such a shame because it almost hits the same mark that Rosemary Clooney did in her version. I would love to hear him apply the same care to his arrangements that he did with \"As Good As I Been to You\" or \"World Gone Wrong,\" but he hasn't. There is nothing unexpected in the arrangements and one feels that there was little to no connection between Dylan and these songs. There really is no reason to ever listen to this album again. I might put two or three of the songs (e.g., the aforementioned \"The Christmas Blues\" or \"Must Be Santa\") on a Christmas playlist, but most of the rest of them are simply throwaways. Which is why it is such a shame. This missed opportunity makes you crave for something truly inspired. And you just know that Dylan is capable of it.\n", "val": 5.0465274398447946e-05}

Coupling such rich & warm arrangements with such strained & anemic vocals ends up being kind of a \"Beauty and the Beast\" situation, only highlighting the vocal problems.I am sure hardcore Dylan devotees will knock me for my review, but unless you're a hardcore Dylan devotee I can't imagine this album having much appeal.

{"text": "After seeing so many polarizing reviews of this album on here, I felt it absolutely necessary to add my .02.  Evidently, either one loves this album (5 stars) or absolutely thinks it's a catastrophe (1 star).  Both camps have their points, yes.  I must address the 1 star folks, though.Bob Dylan has for over 5 decades now shown deep respect to so many wonderful, disparate genres of music from and within America.  Call it \"roots music\" or \"Americana\" or whatever, Bob respects everything from gospel to hillbilly bluegrass to jazz.  And by people that long were dead and gone by the time he picked up a harmonica way back when.  Anyone who ever caught Dylans' Theme Time Radio Hour on satellite radio know what I mean.So it is completely understandable for Dylan to attempt an album of Christmas songs.  Why the hell shouldn't he?  If there's anyone who has license to add to the canon of Christmas music, it's Bob.Christmas In The Heart is a compilation of some very popular Christmas tunes and some pretty obscure ones, each one interpreted by Dylan and an incredibly talented group of backing musicians and vocalists.  One should not, however, expect to hear Montovanni or Perry Como.  No Kenny G, either.  As has always been the case, only Bob Dylan sounds like Bob Dylan.  Like him or not, he was well into his 60's when he recorded these tracks.  Time does that to *anyones* voice.  Everyone that harps on his \"phleghm-caked\" or \"gravelly, marble-filled\" vocals really should show some respect.  He's an artist.  He can try new things with old songs.  Why not?The set list is diverse and sweet.  \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\", \"The Christmas Song\" and \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" (with a verse in Latin) mix beautifully with \"The Christmas Blues\", \"Christmas Island\" and what might be the finest cover song ever recorded--\"Must Be Santa\".  Really, when was the last time you heard a good accordion solo?  Priceless.And that's what this album is to me--priceless.  Bob Dylan takes such care and joy in selecting each song--another example of a tribute from him--that this album is truly endearing.  No, it's not polished.  Yes his voice croaks during \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\".  But that's life, ladies and gentlemen.

{"text": "Why five stars?  Because of the pure joy this album has given me since I first started listening to it a couple of weeks ago.  I was in a Barnes and Noble the weekend before Thanksgiving, checking out some sales, surrounded by swirling Christmas shoppers, and then the music started . . .  It was \"good\" Christmas music, by some notable artist or group that hit every note exactly right and sang each song exactly in the spirit traditionally intended.  But suddenly the room started spinning and I knew I had to get out.  By the time I got home, I told my wife I was through shopping this Christmas (I hadn't even started).  I was desperate for an antidote, something to pull me out of the seasonal doldrums.  What could there be out there?  Then it hit me: what about that Dylan Christmas album that so many people disparaged last year?  Surely he would have a different take on things, right?  He certainly doesn't disappoint in that regard.For starters, he sends visual clues before you even play the album.  The front is pure, secular Americana.  The back is very traditionally religious.  And then you open it, and, well . . . if that isn't Betty Page in the most tastefully seductive Christmas outfit I've seen in a long time!  So what's on the album musically?  Traditional secular songs, traditional religious songs, and some things that are just plain fun.Then there's the sound.  I honestly don't get people complaining about his voice.  This is Bob Dylan, after all.  Were they really expecting him to suddenly sound like Nat King Cole?  (I've tried to imagine how the conversation went at home:  \"Honey?  I bought the new Dylan Christmas album.  Guess what?  He still sounds like Dylan!  Damn!\")He was nearly 70 years old when he recorded this.  He's been straining those vocal chords publicly for over 50 years now.  Why in the world would you expect anything different?  For whatever reason, at this point in his life, he decided to record a Christmas album.  Is it possible that this is exactly what the title proclaims--his expression of the varieties of what Christmas means to him, from his heart?  Personally, I find some of these to be the most genuinely heartfelt renditions I have ever heard, precisely because they come from Bob Dylan.  (One reviewer said that if this was recorded by some nobody named \"Bob Smith,\" we wouldn't care and would agree that this is a \"terrible\" album.  To which I ask, \"What's your point?\"  Objectively speaking, how \"good\" musically are Johnny Cash's final albums?  But those of us who loved his music over the years love those last offerings as well especially because we know he was singing from the heart and soul more than from whatever was left of his voice.)Maybe I have always been more tolerant of Dylan's voice because of other voices I have loved, especially among the blues artists he admires so much.  Listen to Son House, Reverend Gary Davis, Skip James, Robert Pete Williams, etc.  Their voices aren't immediately accessible in the usual sense.  They don't always hit the right notes, and it's often hard to understand them.  But as you do come to understand them, both their music and their words, you discover a depth and an authenticity that far exceeds that of supposedly more accomplished artists.  Which is why they, like Dylan, have been so influential on musicians more agreeable to the ears of the general public.As I write this, 151 people have given this album 5 stars, 110 have given it 1 star.  About 100 other people are scattered evenly through the other ratings.  Can you imagine anyone other than Bob Dylan so polarizing music fans?So what's the bottom line?  If you like Bob Dylan, the most important thing I want to impress upon you is that you owe it to yourself to give it a sympathetic listen before dismissing it.  (Listen carefully for the interesting, often subtle, twists he gives to some of the lyrics.)  You may in fact find it to be as horrible as some have delighted in writing.  Then again, you may find it a wondrous relief in the midst of another miserable Christmas season.  Remember: Dylan has been angering/disappointing/annoying people for almost 50 years.  And the odd thing has been that the people he has irritated the most have often been those who proclaim themselves to be his fans. (Notice how many of the 1 star critics attempt to establish their street cred before ripping away.  And remember how often his fans have been the bane of his existence.)The common theme through the years is that whenever he has dared to do something different, something he himself liked for whatever reason, many of his supposed fans, instead of honoring his right as an artist to grow, change, and explore (whether it be going electric, turning religious, exploring country music, or whatever), have felt the right, indeed the need, to pronounce profound and absolute judgment.  How many times does this man have to hear someone yell, \"Judas!\"?Instead, I say, Merry Christmas, Mr. Dylan, and thank you.  God bless us everyone. (Amen.)\n", "val": 0.03139664977788925}

As one die-hard fan said, this will indeed become a \"landmark\" album--much in the same way that William Shatner's \"The Transformed Man\" is.Thank you, Bob Dylan, for this wonderful Christmas present. We will listen to it, or a portion of it, every Christmas just for a tear-producing laugh.

I cannot recommend it enough, if you love to watch old Xmas movies and listen to great, traditional Xmas songs.  This collection, when first released last year, made me stop and think \"no...NOT Dylan too!\".  The more I thought about it, I thought it was too kitsch, and being a huge Dylan Fan, I thought at the time 'what the heck'.  Also sent some to friends for the holidays.Well, this is my all-time fav Xmas music to listen to!!  Dylan's honest, heartfelt renditions (of course!) are excellent, and when you add the kitschy soundtracks and background vocals, it can't be beat.  It warms my heart as a nice hot toddy warms my body.  I cannot recommend this enough!  My friends called and emailed when they got this delivered for Xmas, and they all said the same thing: Bob Dylan for Christmas - OF COURSE!  The fact that all the royalties are donated to his favorite feed the hungry NP makes it all that much sweeter.  If you 'do' the Xmas music thing every year, then you MUST have this for your Spirits, Friends and Family for Christmas.  Even E.

He wasn't Bing Crosby with a voice that graveled and sputtered like the battered Army truck he came in with those buoyant USO girls and the band. It didn't matter. Those boys couldn't get a pass to the town that night, not when partisans were still at large and everyone knew the Soviets would take advantage of the chaos if they could.The letters came with them and Christmas cards from schoolchildren in Minneapolis. And the singer gave them-their own memories. So maybe afterward nobody remembered the singer, or the pathetic band-they were thinking of home and those they couldn't be holding and kissing and sitting by the stove with that night. Comfort and joy. And tears. Hope, too, because the war was over and soon they'd be home and every man swore he'd never leave home again as long as he lived, and most of them never did-not counting the ones who were laughing and dancing, because a heart of stone won't weigh a man down like love does.\n", "val": 7.139619265217334e-05}

Providing saccharine settings for the gurgling croak and the gravelly wheeze of a lifelong smoker pretty much defines the word \"ill-conceived.\" Since he's one of the greatest songwriters ever, and since he's donating his profits from this album to good causes, I may forgive Dylan someday, but first I'll have to somehow forget hearing Santa Claus dragged over the coals and the Little Drummer Boy strangled and the Herald Angels scream. Do you hear what I hear? Then plug your ears! What could they have been thinking when they recorded this disgraceful dreck?I'll give this much to the CD: it's given Amazon reviewers the opportunity to sharpen their wit and lavish the music with the caustic comments it deserves. Allow me to quote a few of them: \"He makes Tom Waits sound like Perry Como.\" \"It's enough to make the most devout Christian consider atheism. Giving this two stars. One for each of Bob's tar-filled lungs.\" \"If I were a little kid, I'd run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen. Actually, I may do that myself.\" \"Perhaps a better name for the album would have been 'Your Crazy Uncle Gets Drunk at the Family Christmas Party and Starts Singing.'\" \"This collection of Christmas cacophony causes me to cringe. Forced to sit through it again I might very well have to hang myself by the chimney with care.\" \"Knocks William Shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever.\" \"Farcical at best and just plain creepy at worst.\"Had enough? I think not. You may still be considering a purchase, so permit me to present a few more carefully chosen words of warning: \"Just listening curdles my innards.\" \"Possibly the worst album ever recorded.\" \"Like being sucker punched at a birthday party.\" \"An album of Christmas music that could be used to interrogate detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\" \"Jesus Christ, I feel like climbing up on a cross after one listen.\" \"Everyone involved in performing, producing, and distributing this monstrosity should be jailed for assault.\" \"Sounds like karaoke at a nursing home.\" \"Sounds like a cross between Joe Cocker and a chainsaw.\" \"Sounds as if he's been gargling with old razor blades.\" \"Sounds like he's singing through a tracheotomy.\" \"Sounds like Swamp Thing with a cold.\" \"Dylan ruins Christmas.\"Please, please, please: listen to a few of the flabbergasting, nausea-inducing audio clips before you buy.

{"text": "I have lived with Christmas In The Heart for a few months with my opinion pinballing between inspired, strange, jarring or, just plain boring. No matter, as a Christmas album CITH succeeds admirably simply because it turns some of the well trodden holiday canon on its head - however, as a birthday album, I remain less convinced.There are families today who think nothing about dropping significant coin on birthday celebrations for their children that would make some third-world plutocrats blush at their opulence and excess - I can only imagine their white hot rage and ensuing lawsuit histrionics if the trapeze artist, juggling troupe or Animal Planet snake charmer showed up drunk or stoned all but ruining the three-ring processional for little Chase or Cassandra.Now imagine a parent's reaction if the true Eternal God were to punch up Dylan's Christmas In The Heart on His celestial iPod. After having lived through Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer or Ray Conniff's World of Christmas Strings, would He smile at Bob, just thankful for something different in tribute to His Son or would the grizzled, gargling with gasoline vocals finally push Him over the edge - it's hard to say how the Lord of Hosts - who has always been comfortable with a righteous smite, smote or pox - would handle the situation.Despite his Christian dabbling, Dylan has really always been an Old Testament guy, so he, more than anyone, must know that the odds are definitely with the House on this one.So, with hands trembling on the keyboard and eyes averted skyward for a wayward bolt of score settling lightening, I endorse Christmas In The Heart as an authentic roots classic that just may grow on you - and hopefully Him.\n", "val": 0.0006005223258398473}

And, just as significant, Jack Frost is still at the producing helm.Frost's production is impeccable:  The clarity of the music is crystal clear and emulates the desire that Dylan has consistently coveted throughout his career,  and I love the supporting voices that garner nearly every song without going mushy (say, in contrast to Phil Spector's controversial hand with The Beatles' \"The Long and Winding Road\").Still, many may find Dylan's voice unsuitable to the material.  For me, I've described his gravelly voice of late as being Leon Redbone`s successor, so many of the traditional numbers are given a rustic appeal other renditions lack.  \"Here Comes Santa Claus,\" \"Winter Wonderland,\" and \"Little Drummer Boy\" work in spades for me.This isn't to say there isn't overreaching.  \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" is meant to soar, and Dylan's voice doesn't muster what is necessary to carry it through.  With all due respect, I have a feeling that for some of you, my exceptions may prove your rule.Clearly the best songs are lesser known works which are garnished by Bob Dylan's most excellent supporting band.  \"The Christmas Blues\" (Sammy Cahn & David Jack Holt) gives the dinner club jazz sensibilities inherent in 'Modern Times,' and \"Christmas Island\" (Lyle Moraine) competes with The Beach Boys' \"Melekalikimaka\".  Perhaps the best song, \"Must Be Santa,\" (William Fredericks and Hal Moore) incorporates what could be described as a ho-down at a Swiss Lodge.  It's highly festive and full of good humor.  If only all the songs could be this good, we'd have one of the great Christmas classics of all time.When one hears a C.D. throughout and cannot appreciate it after several listenings, then it's easy to dismiss.  I still haven't tired of 'A Christmas in the Heart,' which is still playing in the car, on the C.D. player, and in the I-Pod inside my head alongside the fondest of my most recent Christmas memories.\n", "val": 0.012007302604615688}

To me, it's Bob Dylan re-presenting 20th-Century American Christmas music without a commercial gloss and with a great amount of sincerity and charm.  Never mind the raspy voice.  Perhaps Dylan is in the role of a \"white Satchmo\" on this work, with all due respect to the great Louis Armstrong.  It's a big plus to me that the profits of this album go to charity.

Some 3 million homes have been foreclosed on so far, putting millions out on the cold streets desperate to find other accommodations, dependent on the rentier class. The social implications of that many people and their families thrown into crisis by the predatory land-grabbers, the banksters and their politically-positioned co-conspirators are complex and will be long-lasting. Hungry people do desperate things to feed themselves and their families. People crowd into houses with relatives, friends, strangers. Conflicts and abuses take place in that crowding that may never heal. Spirits get crushed and may never recover.

{"text": "I love Christmas albums. I have several in my household, ranging from A Charlie Brown Christmas to a Bobby Sherman Christmas. I also have Mitch Miller's famous one, along with Phil Spector's Christmas Album. And I can safely say that this album can stand with those easily.  Bob Dylan's Christmas in the Heart is one of the best Christmas albums I've ever heard.There is a tendency by people to mock this album even before hearing it. Bob Dylan making a Christmas album? Even as a Dylan fan, I was surprised at first, then delighted. This is a really good and heartfelt album.  It has excellent arrangements of Christmas classics, and it has a few tunes that I've never heard before (like The Christmas Blues).  The arrangement of Must Be Santa is rocking and phenonemal, to say the least.  Dylan even adds some hysterical lyrics at the end, and it totally works. On Dylan's last album, Together Through Life, the arrangements were a little loose and relaxed.  Sometimes that worked, other times it didn't. Here, Dylan's band is tight as they have ever been, and it really helps the music immensely. Sure, Dylan's voice is, to quote a song of his, like a \"bullfrog croakin'\", but it doesn't bother me that much.  In fact, on some of the ballads here, his ragged voice works wonders, like on some of the ballads on Modern Times.  The best examples of that are The First Noel, Silver Bells, and Hark the Herald Angels Sing.  I also love the tenderness of Winter Wonderland and The First Noel here, and the charm of Here Comes Santa Claus as well.This album has turned out to be one of Dylan's most polarising albums EVER, and I'm really not entirely sure why.  Some of the reactions are downright bizarre at times.  Maybe it's because Dylan is truly sincere here, paying tribute to Christmas songs he heard when he was a child, and that there is no condenscension towards the audience here.  No self conscious smugness.  Just a great record brilliantly performed.  Many people were polarised by Dylan's Christian period as well (which was much underrated in my opinion). Normally, I would recommend this album to Dylan completists, but I recommend it to everyone now. I'm not going to be an idiot contrarian by saying it's Dylan's best album ever (it isn't), but I like it as much as Together Through Life (his other 2009 album), and I have played it quite a lot since I bought it back in November 2009.Christmas in the Heart is one of Dylan's most memorable albums, like it or not.\n", "val": 0.09342463314533234}

Most of the songs are unremarkable saccharine dittys.  Those who actually like (this) kind of music are extremely unlikely to be Dylan fans; Dylan fans are for the most part likely to be (as I am) merely bewildered by these selections.  I don't believe Dylan intended some sort of sly irony or subtle parody in creating this record.

{"text": "It's too bad Dylan didn't release this album back in the late 1980s, when he was still in fine voice (well, fine for him), since he seems to be channeling his inner Wilbury on this project. Some of the songs, to be sure, are delivered without a hint of irony or playfulness, mostly the overtly religious ones, such as \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing,\" \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" and \"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\" A couple of them are unfortunate evidence that some songs are well out of his range and the result is rather painful to listen to (\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" almost demands the listener to respond, \"I dunno, Bob. I'm hearing you miss a lot of notes in this song. Is that what you hear, too?\"). But then again, some of the traditional songs are genuinely pleasant to the ear, such as \"Little Drummer Boy,\" which conjures up distant memories of \"Nashville Skyline\" when Dylan found a sweeter voice for his \"country\" album. The real highlights of this Christmas collection, though (and let's be clear here - while this may not quite be \"Slow Sleigh Coming,\" it's very much grounded in the Christian tradition), are two songs as archetypically Dylanesque as anything else he's ever recorded: the superb \"The Christmas Blues\" and the raucous, infectious \"Must Be Santa.\" In the final analysis, it's really hard to know exactly what Dylan's concept for this might have been - some of the songs feature backup singers right out of the Ray Conniff school (\"Winter Wonderland,\" \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\") and the cover artwork is almost cloying in its evocation of Currier & Ives. But then, what are we to think of the Bettie Page photo inside the booklet, which evokes an entirely different mood? Ultimately, we'll have to just chalk this one up to Dylan being Dylan, and just enjoy its highlights.\n", "val": 0.0002138378331437707}

{"text": "It is a common opinion that Dylan's greatest strength is his lyrics - no, it is his singing that is his greatest strength. It is interesting to see the number of 1 star reviews for this album of tuneful cover versions. A lot of folks don't seem to like dylan's singing here never mind the backing singers or the fact that he is 68 years old. When Dylan wrote a mainly instrumental album in the early 70's it was still his vocals that clinched the deal. For example, there is a beautiful longish instrumental build up to Billy 1 but when the vocal comes in you are in the prescence of vocal greatness - it is simple as that. What has that got to do with 'Christmas in the Heart' in 2009. Well there is a lack of respect or ignorance towards Bob Dylan the vocalist. Remember 'No auction Block' from the early 60's a song that is not a Dylan original but how good is the vocal ? i mean really just how seriously great a singer is he? Here on this fabulous christmas album nearly 50 years later it is a voice that has sung many a song and 'lived a life'. 'I'll be home for christmas' has something in the vocal that hits the nail on the head as to what that song is about - never heard a better version this side of Elvis Presley. i think i'll phone up Josh Groban and ask him how good a singer is Bob Dylan and if he thinks his version is better? I don't know what he would say - really don't -love the way Dylan can release a grest record and have fervent fans give it 1 star . i spoke to Elvis recently and this is what he said: \"Dylan's voice cuts through iron and steel - it is truthful and gets to me like no other. i really liked 'Christmas in the Heart' ..i'm a big fan -\" The cd has 15 tracks covering the main bases of what christmas has become and therefore what it is :) there are 4 tracks that are joyful in their insanity - 'here comes santa' 'winter wonderland' are a bit mental as is the frantic 'must be santa' -a party song if ever i've heard one. Possibly the most nutty track is 'Christmas Island' - the fruity backing singers and guitars are a joy to behold as are the words referencing presents in the canoe and staying up late with the islanders. Yes, Christmas pretty much has descended into madness these days. Dylan also presents 'O Little Town Of Bethlehem', 'Hark The Herald Angels Sing' and 'The First Noel' traditional carols in case we forget we are suppose to be celebrating the incarnation of the solid rock made before the foundation of the world :) Hanging on? can't say - oh i forgot about 'oh come all ye faithful' that starts off with some frankly bizarre Latin (and not any south american vibe). When i was speaking with Elvis he thought his version was better but he did not want to make a big fuss about it out of respect for Dylan. There is 'drummer boy' too and a thankfully less sugary 'do you hear what i hear' than Bing Crosby's version. There are also a few nostalgia type tracks such as 'silver bells' and the nat king colish 'christmas song'. Like several dozen others the record reflects Christmas has become a variety of things; for some it seems to be a time of intense loneliness because there is something about the festive period that brings this out. Dylan does 'christmas blues' one of the most interesting songs here and it does a great job conveying that sadness -one of two without the backing singers. It too has a great vocal. The album cover, title and even the saucy inlay let us know not be too serious here. Dylan, of course, is a music lover.

I don't really have the time, as all my fans know, however I am known for my sacrifices for the public good. So, I have torn myself away from my hot toddy to write this. Are you satisfied now? And, yes, I do expect many presents under the tree to show just gratitude. If not, yellow journalism will prevail on future reviews. And, I do name names (!).O.K., aside from all that, let me tell you I met up with Bob (at his request) some months back to discuss his forthcoming Christmas offering. He arrived at a famous coffee shop in NYC looking refreshed and pleased. \"What have you been up to Bob\"? I asked. \"Well Metamorpho, I think you and everybody will be surprised that I recorded a Christmas Album\", he said as he used great amounts of honey in his coffee to sooth his vocal chords. \"But Bob\", I said, \"You didn't do the standard Christmas songs everybody knows. Did you? I'm sure you wrote them yourself\".Bob paused. He gazed out of the window, watching people pass by that he knew would be wearing warm overcoats and boots eventually. Then he looked at me. Peering.\"You know Metamorpho, I am getting on in age and I need a break. I have written songs for almost 50 years now. I just need to relax a bit and do some covers\". To tell you the truth people, I sympathized with Bob. After all, he is one of my biggest fans.He then lightened up. \"I think you will be surprised. And my vocals are not bad considering I have 10,000 nodules on my vocal chords\". It flashed in my mind that I did an internet search once and it said he started his career with only a 1,000 nodules but they have increased expoentially each year. \"Well, I'm sure it will be fine\". He then got up to leave and said goodbye. He left money for the coffee but I had to cover the tip myself. I guess he doesn't know your beloved Metamorpho is a non-profit Seer. I was a tad annoyed, however, I learned later that he donated the album profits to charity. He probably had to save the tip amount for studio time. Whatever.Anyway, after you muddled through this somehow up until now, I really should tell you about the album. It's fun. It truly is. Who would have thought he'd do this at his age. But hey, if you're Bob Dylan you've earned the right to do anything you want musically. He has vocal abuse, and it shows here. Raspy and rough in spots. This might be off-figgy-pudding to some (but face it, the main objection to his tunes was probably his voice, thus, what's new?). The album has a down home appeal, reminiscent of some tunes from the 50's. The band provides great backing and is perfect for his voice. And, I have to be honest here, the more you listen to this the better it becomes. (No! I won't allow you to blame the vast amounts of spiked egg nog I've had this evening!). Then again, one has learned from the past to never take Dylan at face value. There is always more there. And you may not realize it until many years hence.I'm giving this 4 stars. It is by no means a classic, but hey, it's Dylan. People will say that my review is tainted because I know him personally and I am an avid fan of his prior work. Well, I might give him a slight edge here. But, honestly, it's not as bad as some people would have you believe. Yeah, it's rough in spots. But as I said, it's a fun recording (and I believe sincere as well). In my book, fun should always win out. Especially at this time of year. So, I recommend it if you are not overly critical and being a grinch. Dylan has made a career fighting the establishment Grinchs. He's always won. And, he'll win this one as well.Now, let me get out my thermalite Seer's outfit. Looks like snow!Holly Jolly, Hot Toddy, Good Golly Miss Molly!love, Metamorpho ;)\n", "val": 0.00867783185094595}
{"text": "I've been a fan of Dylan's since I was thirteen years old -- it has been nearly 45 years since I first heard him sing.  When I read that he was making a Christmas album, I thought the world as I knew it was coming to an end.  Of course I knew I would buy it -- out of curiosity if nothing else.  Perhaps I would listen to it once (just to hear for myself if this was really true), and then keep it as a \"collector's item.\"Well, my husband gave me the cd last Friday night, and I first played it as I was cleaning up the horse  barn Saturday morning.  Imagine my surprise when I realized I LOVED it!  I laughed, I cried, I danced a little as I was shoveling and sweeping, and I sang along.  It is a truly strange Christmas album, though -- much more musically informed than the \"Xmas Muzak\" we're used to hearing.The band is first rate (I think this is the band Dylan has had with him on the never ending concert tour).  The sound on many of the songs is very 40's & 50's -- back up vocals, etc., but with more depth and a bit of an edge.  It is not cliche', and it is not \"superficial.\"  There is some tongue-in-cheek stuff, in \"Here Comes Santa Claus.\"  \"Must be Santa Claus\" sounded like frantic Klezmer music.  The little bit of harmonica in \"Winter Wonderland\" is an unusual touch.  \"Little Drummer Boy\" seems totally sincere and actually brought a few tears... even though I am emphatically NOT a fan of that song.  Rum pom pom pom, indeed.The fact that ALL of Dylan's royalties, current and future are going to a charity that feeds the hungry  is enough to make me like the album (if not actually listen to it).  But, I've found myself listening to it at least once a day, sometimes twice or three times, since I got it.  It lifts my spirits.  My sense is that Dylan had great fun doing this \"work\" -- and his enjoyment is contagious.  I've bought several more copies to give as gifts.\n", "val": 0.03835490718483925}

This is Bob Dylan, and these are Christmas songs. He sounds no different than he has over the last 10-15 years, and this is simply a fun new twist on the same old Christmas tunes we've heard year after year. In fact it does have that \"throw-back\" sound and theme to it which makes it all the better. The only drawback I found was that there may have been 1 or 2 blips where his voice comes off as \"over-gravelly\" on some of the slower, more religious tunes, but this did not damper my overall impression of the CD whatsoever. Must Be Santa i do agree is a highlight. Some of you people reviewing here sound as if you are waiting for the second coming of \"Highway 61 Revisited\". Well, it ain't coming.

I'm not being snotty, but let's face it: Dylan's made a career out of faking left while he goes right.  For this one, a traditional Christmas collection is given the rough-and-ready treatment.  It's almost like the town drunk took control of a small town Christmas pageant and led the singers and musicians into a fractured world of holiday glee, sincere yet strangely damaged.  Traditional \"sweet\" elements are still on show, but they're backed with Dylan's wheezy croak.  It's reminiscent of some of the things Tom Waits was doing in the early 1980s.  Anyhow, that's my take on this very excellent album.  Of course, for Christmas albums, I also like Tiny Tim's Christmas and Leon Redbone's Christmas Island.  They're both bizarre in their own right, but neither even begins to approach the strangeness of this one.  By the way, one reviewer (who hated the album) boasted that he was a hardcore Dylan fan who \"even likes half of Self Portrait.\"  If it tells you anything, I like ALL of Self Portrait, I like all of Under the Red Sky (Dylan's children's album) and even enjoy the bleary and endless covers he and The Band do on the 5-disk Basement Tapes collection.

Energy should not be wasted trying to convert those who simply find this CD unpleasant.  It's not for everybody.  It wasn't designed to be.  I'm simply grateful that it is for me.Nor should 1-star reviewers expend their energy trying to convince us we're \"listening to a different album\" -- we're not -- there are simply two very different camps of listeners, and hearing Dylan's take on these eternal Christmas tunes will invariably turn some people's heads upside down, especially those with strong conceptions of how Christmas music is \"supposed\" to sound, for those who cannot get past the reality that Dylan's voice is not as strong as it was decades ago, and especially for those who do not give the album more than a few spins.It wasn't until my fourth or fifth time through the album that I went from thinking, \"What's he doing to these songs?!\" to, \"Wait a minute, get over your preconceptions, listen to the passion, the phrasing, the heart, and trust the artist for a moment.\"  So I did.  And now I have played this album at least fifty times in my car, and absolutely unconditionally love it.In spite of, or in some ways because of Dylan's worn but still deeply heartfelt vocals, this album has won me over.  His voice isn't what it once was, but there's more truth in a hoarse, guttural, strained Dylan's pipes than in most singers half his age.Dylan's reputation was not made by covering others' material.  By doing essentially an album of cover tunes -- and covers of some of the most iconic songs in the American songbook -- he is battling not only those who come to these songs closely analyzing his pitch and vocal strength, but also those who simply cannot get past what these song are \"supposed\" to sound like.  I submit that if the songs on this album were heard for the first time on this record instead of being the tried and true classics they are, this CD would be heralded as a landmark recording.  But getting past one's preconceptions is likely half the battle.  I'm thankful I was able to do so.Favorite tracks are:Winter WonderlandHave Yourself a Merry Little ChristmasSilver BellsThe song that took me the longest to enjoy was \"Must Be Santa.\"  But eventually, Dylan's \"ho ho ho!\" some 55 seconds in grabbed me, and now I'm hooked.Polarizing?

My mistake, of course, would be thinking that a Christmas album cannot be high minded and fun at the same time.  This album is both.  The instant classic, \"Must Be Santa\" is a fun tribute to St. Nick (I recommend the video on You Tube) while at the same time, his reading of \"Little Drummer Boy\" is reverent and reminds us that Jesus is the reason for Christmas.  Another stand out tune is \"Christmas Blues\" which is the only song Dylan records in the blues style of his recent albums.  It is fabulous tune about a guy who has no one to share Christmas with.  The album as a whole is mostly classics, but they are so fresh as they are filtered through Dylan's own unique style and vocals.  Dylan is underrated as an arranger of music.

{"text": "The people writing one-star reviews for this album apparently aren't familiar with Dylan's recent music. If you know what his voice and his band sound like nowadays, the sound of this album probably won't be a shock (except maybe for the female chorus -- more like a vintage Christmas LP than the soulful female backups heard on a lot of Dylan's '70s and '80s music). Essentially, it's the current Dylan sound applied to some familiar Christmas tunes (and a few less familiar, including probably the best and least \"kitschy\" track, Christmas Blues). Yes, I do think Bob is consciously indulging in a bit of kitsch, but it still comes across as a sincere performance of music he truly appreciates. In his memoir published a few years ago, Chronicles Vol. 1, he refers to his fondness for Christmas music, dating from his Minnesota days.Still, I think the five-star reviews are a little out of hand. To me, five-star Dylan is Freewheelin', Highway 61, Blood on the Tracks, and a few others. This one certainly doesn't scale those heights. The chorus singers handle more vocals than you might expect on some songs where I would have liked to hear more Bob. (Plus, as my title suggests, vinyl buyers don't get the fun Bettie Page pic, but I didn't dock points for that.)\n", "val": 0.0014056686777621508}

{"text": "This is one of Dylan's most satisfying albums. People often forget that Dylan's genius lies in his ability to shape, morph, transmogrify, and cut through words. His brilliance is not in his lyrics but in his delivery of those lyrics. With that in mind, it doesn't matter what songs Dylan sings, so long as he sings them. His early '90s albums \"Good As I Been To You\" and \"World Gone Wrong\" are excellent examples: all songs are extant folk songs, and he discovers new truths in those rusty, dusty gems. Same goes for \"Christmas In The Heart.\"\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" weeps. \"Christmas Blues\" lilts. \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" glitters. Dylan plumbs buried tinsel from Christmas chestnuts long wearied from commercialism and overplay. If that's not genius, nothing is genius. If you grew up with these songs and love Dylan--and not just young Bob, but old, haggard troubador Bob--then you will love this album like a tattered childhood Christmas stocking.\"Christmas In The Heart\" is a genuine, honest, rough and beautiful album.

I read these 1-star reviews and think the writers haven't had a day of fun in their life, lighten up--It's Christmas! Frankly, it's a shame that people have had to be Dylan fans for 40 years and they couldn't start listening to him in 1997, and have Time Out of Mind be their first record. I love his wheezy voice--it sounds traveled and wise and punctuates phrasing and words unlike any other singer. I personally like every post-1997 album better than anything that preceded it--those 1960s albums are frozen in the past. I'll admit that somewhere between Modern Times and Together Through Life his voice lost some of the warmth, or he just decided to crank up the rawness. It certainly shows up here, and he gets my sympathy on the high notes on some of these songs. On the other hand, Christmas songs have never sounded more alive than on Winter Wonderland (when he cuts in with \"before the other kind go knock him down\" I always smile, because it's Bob), did anybody really listen to Do You Hear What I Hear and notice \"pray for peace people everywhere\" as much as on this record?, I'll Be Home for Christmas (never has the song sounded so close to its intent--this person won't be home, despite his heart), The Christmas Blues is worth the cost of the album and so is Must be Santa--what fun!

While it appears that Dylan has yet again upset many of his fans, this CD should be taken for what it is - a Christmas album made specifically for charity and one to be taken of the shelf every December.

Having grown up through his whole career, I never caught on to him for as much as I always tried.  I really tried to listen to this Christmas CD.  I just can't get past his voice, phrasing, singing, mouthing, whatever you want to call it.Dylan ruins Christmas on this effort.

{"text": "I'm breaking a personal rule of mine with this review. I swore that I would never review anything before listening to it completely, with near-full attention - for at least two passes. The very existence of this disk scares such fear into me that I feel that I could never commit to two full listens without developing an intractable opinion, and I admit that my anticipation borders much more closely to fear than holiday cheer. This is Bob Dylan.... (pause required)... Old. Cranky. \"Legendary.\" Impossibly inscrutable...(another pause required)... Bob Dylan. He's been with us - ALL of us - for over forty years. The guy's a Jew, fer Crissakes....(most of the time, anyway) and in the middle of a nearly miraculous career rebirth, he offers us a Christmas album? The first track is \"Here Comes Santa Claus.\" I haven't even started to play the CD yet, but if you were me, what would you expect? Do you need to think about it? As I already pointed out, this is Dylan. I haven't played a single note of this disk yet, but a) I'm showing an obvious tendency toward prejudgment, and b) I feel drawn in, like a moth circling a gas lamp. I can't help but wonder how relevant it would be if I were to actually `expose' some of the lyrics. Let's try it: \" Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  Right down Santa Claus lane...\" Wow. (Another pause is DEFINITELY required now...). As I type this, I'm hearing it for the first time, and I'm dumbfounded. This album's very existence is as improbable as monkeys on the moon. OK, the heck with it. I admit it, I'm suckered in. \"How would/could Dylan possibly sing this?\", I ask myself. The answer, I'm feeling, is \"Quite well\". Maybe I'm enjoying WAY too much holiday cheer at this exact moment, but Dylan just sang \"Winter Wonderland\" and I felt like drinking egg nog. He sounds forced as he croaks/sings, \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,\" but as I listen, I wonder if his interpretation may have value for breaking down religious barriers. Our culture has thoroughly analyzed every syllable that Bob has ever uttered, right? Maybe non-Christians will finally be able to \"interpret\" Christmas songs and apply totally new meanings to them. Or, maybe that's crazy. This album is simply too weird for me to predict how any individual person might react. In terms of quantity, it's generous, with fifteen tracks. One of them is \"Little Drummer Boy\". Another is \"Must Be Santa (!!), \" but there's authentic stuff here, too, like \"Adeste Fidelis\" and \"The First Noel.\" The packaging conveys the dichotomy as well as anything possibly could. The cover shot is pure Currier and Ives, but inside is a shot that looks like vintage pin-up girl Betty Page. The music walks the same crooked path. It teases me with flashes of relevance, but then succumbs to stereotypes that border on the psychopathic. \"The Christmas Blues\" is easy to appreciate. \"O Little Town of Bethlehem,\" on the other hand, definitely is not. Once again, for the 50th time, we can't tell if Dylan is toying with us, or if he's simply following some extravagant muse. No Matter. Fifty years from now, my kids will try to capture the spirit of Christmas for their own grandkids. Doing so, they will be armed with Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Phil Spector....and perhaps Bob Dylan. Christmas albums come and Christmas albums go. Despite everything we throw at it, I believe that the spirit of Christmas will nevertheless survive. As Bob sings, \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\" `B'...or maybe `C', or maybe even `A'. You figure it out.  Tom Ryan\n", "val": 0.00013521767687052488}

I have always admired Dylan's songwriting talent... agreeing with many music critics and his legions of hard-core fans, that he is an extraordinary poet and social commentator. That said, this may very well be the worst Christmas album ever recorded by a major music artist. While I can understand that Dylan's voice is appealing (or at least passable) to many of his life-long, hard-core fans, for those of us who have listened to his more recent albums with objectivity, his voice has become increasingly more difficult to stomach.At least with his newer original material, many non-hardcore fans can still respect and appreciate his songwrititng talents and get beyond his increaingly strained, weary and gravelly voice. But to hear Bob Dylan clearly straining to sing beloved Christmas Classics like, \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\", \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\", \"O' Come All Ye Faithful\", \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\", \"Christmas Song' and \"O' Little Town of Bethlehem\" made me cringe repeatedly with each warbling syllable. Dylan's, embarassing take on (the album closer) \"O' Little Town of Bethlehem\" has to go down as one of the most unlistenable Christmas tracks that I have ever heard.

I downloaded five of the songs, because I did find a couple funny, so I'll discuss only those songs. \"The Christmas Blues\" is something I'd never heard. It's good and well-suited to Dylan's voice.  The great classics are a revelation as Dylan sings them.  \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" is sweet, simple, but with an added undercurrent of sadness and irony.  Maybe Dylan didn't mean it anyway, but it's just what comes out of him.  \"The Christmas Song\" and \"I'll be Home for Christmas\"  provide a welcome new perspective on songs I've heard too many times.

What about Bob? Sorry, but this album misses the mark (any mark) by a country mile.There are so many problems with this record, that it's hard to know where to begin. Ok, let's start with the first song, Here comes Santa Claus. If you played that song for a hundred people, 95% would say Bob's singing is horrible. The other 5% would be lying. Yes, that majority opinion would include a lot of Dylan's fans too (I'm one of them.) Honestly, I thought this whole concept was a joke: The cheesy slick production juxtaposed by Bob's gurgling attempts at singing.What made Dylan a legend is his songwriting. Recent recordings (with his shot voice) work because of his lyrics. When his road worn voice tells a story from his pen you believe every word. It feels real.I think a Dylan Christmas album would have worked if he had done something similar to The Pogues. Their singer's voice is ripped to shreds but his sad/funny lines coupled with a sweeping arrangement work wonderfully. One track on the disc works in this manner: Must Be Santa. The rest are clunkers (where's my cash?) I gave this record two stars because I couldn't live with myself if I gave the great Bob Dylan one star.Bowie once said Dylan had a voice of sand and glue.

He is funny, and he knows it. He is also apparently a man of unconventional faith. The CD alternates between popular Christmas songs (many of which I have never liked, even in childhood, because they depressed me -- I still can smell alcohol on their breath and they make me wary of adults) and traditional Christmas hymms and ends with Bob Dylan singing a solemn \"Amen,\" as is done at the end of prayers in Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition.Although I was raised as a Christian, I began to question what I had been taught at church at about the time I first heard Bob Dylan -- when I was 14 years old. I knew then that I wasn't alone with my questions. I am not a member of any organized religious or spiritual community, but I am still not alone with my questions either. As a woman of unconventional faith, I've got to say that I like Bob Dylan's Christmas CD. It's got heart, levity and gravity. It's not a sermon. He's not preaching.

On both accounts, but the Lobos goes Disney is for another review.There must be an age cut off, at some point the music on this album would not be subliminal or so familiar. This is quilt music, americana and possibly one of Dylans greatest folk records to date. Dylan has never recorded an album of such universally familiar songs albeit songs of the holidays. These tunes are as embedded as \"happy birthday\" (thank you sir Paul) but mostly heard now by the endless soundtrack of retail propaganda. Those who are of age will be equally familiar with the handling of the material. There is something oddly comforting about these recordings. A sort of Bing Crosby thing but it's Bob and the band is grooving. Thick dripping tones from the guitars and keys, smoke and leather.I think this album will remain, for me an oddity for sometime.

There comes a time in everyones life, when it is time to get off the stage, whether you are a doctor, heavy equipment operator, or in this case an musician.

My favorites: \"The Christmas Blues\" and \"Must Be Santa\" which can be described as a \"Swisskapolka\" meets the seven dwarfs. Love it. Ordered it. Thanks Bob.

{"text": "What can say.  I love Bob Dylan and I love Christmas albums.  Having said that this album is for \"Dylan completists\" only.  Bob's strained and gargling voice is the main downside on \"Christmas In The Heart\".  His vocal styling may have worked on \"Modern Times\" and \"Love and Theft\" but here it is virtually unlistenable, bordering on laughable.  The only songs that are listenable are \"Must Be Santa\" with its Los Lobos style arrangement and energy and \"The Christmas Song\" which benefits from his world-weary voice.  Kudos to Bob and Sony Music for donating the proceeds to \"Feed The Children\" but overall, unless you need to complete your Dylan or Christmas album collection, give the money straight to your favorite charity instead.\n", "val": 0.0001784427440725267}

A Christmas album...First off, all profits are going to feed a lot of people. It's a very generous and kind thing that he and his record company have decided to do. I don't know of many artists who would be so generous. As far as the quality of the work...Dylan sees things his way...and that's the way it should be. It is what it is. I do think it's time for him to be satisfied and happy with all that he's done and enjoy his grandkids. His legacy is intact, and no one can ever take that away. He done good. His voice has gotten rougher and bluesy-er which I happen to like but only with the right material. A Christmas album is not the right material, by any means. But, again, it will feed a lot of hungry people...so with that in mind...go for it. If anything it could be a collector's item. I still have his \"Little White Wonder\" albums.

No, actually what Bob was attempting is an Album of Christmas music that could be used to interrogate detainees at Guantanamo Bay, until they spill their guts and reveal every terrorist plot ever conceived.Congatulations Bob, you've succeeded at every level....Kermit admits to being a lush. Your in-laws are running like theives in the night, looking for the nearest McDonalds.

It seems Bob has converted yet again.

But he is an American Music/Cultural icon and legend and deserves his place in the Christmas album lexicon. (Heck, Elvis put out two Christmas albums and Johnny Cash three! - there's certainly room for ONE from Bob!)  I have played this record for many people, some fans, some not. Basically the reaction is the same: they smile and yes, laugh (some out loud) and add \"OMG!\" from time to time. But this reaction is consistently for the religious material - come on, that whiskey&smoke voice singing latin -[ who could keep a straight face?!). Without fail however, when one of the very eclectic selections of the secular/popular pieces come on, the reaction changes. \"Whoa, this is a cool!\" I'll Be Home For Christmas, The Christmas Blues, Must Be Santa and especially Christmas Island are not just good - they're great. Throughout however, the arrangements are spot on, Dylan's band - made up mostly of his touring ensemble - is tight and on the money with each selection. So is this for everyone? Certainly not. It is a novelty like all Christmas records and a wonderful way to support the battle against domestic and international hunger as ALL of the proceeds, from now on, go to such worthy organizations. Great for livening up holiday parties and perfect for changing the subject at those uncomfortable family gatherings we all must endure this time of year.  If you love Bob, you'll love it.

If Bob Dylan's voice is a problem, don't buy the albums.What makes this less than excellent for me is one small verse in O Come All Ye Faithful.  The first verse, attempted in Latin, just doesn't get anywhere.  It's as if the song doesn't start until Bob switches to English.  And coming in the middle of the album, it's somewhat hard to skip over that rough bit.  So I'll bear it, knowing now that it does get better.Bob's an optimist at heart, always was, and the subtle and not-so-subtle lyric changes in these classic holiday songs reflect the hope of the season and the hope in his heart.This is going to be played every holiday here for years to come.

{"text": "I like Dylan's Christmas album a lot. I wouldn't argue that this is one of Bob's greatest albums -- it's certainly no Blood on the Tracks or Highway 61 -- but I think it sounds pretty darn good, although I'll admit to being a sucker for most Christmas music. I guess it's a matter of personal taste.I'm not at all surprised that Bob did a Christmas album -- it seems very likely that he's listened to a lot of that stuff. Everyone remembers the pop singers like Andy Williams who've recorded Christmas music, whom you might not imagine Bob listening to, but there's also a long history of old-time country, blues, jazz, and R&B holiday music -- Bob featured some of it on his own 2-hour XM Christmas show. (Anyone interested in some unusual and amazing traditional blues, country, and international Xmas tunes -- check out \"Where Will You Be Christmas Day?\" from the Dust-to-Digital label.)The Louvin Bros., Johnny Cash, Elvis, Charlie Parker, the Maddox Bros. & Rose, Al Jolson, the Everlys, the Staples, BB King, Miles Davis, Pete Seeger (and his half-siblings), Duke Ellington, and even Bessie Smith all recorded one or more Christmas songs or albums. These are artists with whom Bob is undoubtedly familiar (and probably likes), and if I had my Christmas CD collection here, I could name dozens of others.And let's not forget Bing Crosby, the Voice of Christmas. Bob's recent Modern Times album shows very strong influences of Crosby (with Bob actually re-writing some of Bing's 30s hits), so I'd guess that Dylan not only grew up hearing Bing, but has listened to him a lot since then, including his large Christmas catalog. Is it any surprise that Bob would follow Bing into the Christmas genre?Then there are Bob's musical contemporaries, like Chuck Berry, the Beatles (together and individually), Aretha Franklin, Phil Spector, Booker T & The MGs, Leon Redbone, and many others, all of whom have recorded Christmas tunes.So it makes perfect sense to me that Bob is joining this long line ofmusical artists in recording some Christmas music. He obviously knowsthe genre well and has melded the polished \"traditional\" holiday musical arrangements with his own style -- including some pedal steel guitar, accordian, and other elements of his recent recordings. It sounds fine to me.I kind of wonder if he was going for a sound like the Louvin Bros. Christmas album, which has polished arrangements that still have a strong country flavor. I've always liked that album a great deal, and I think Bob has captured some of that sound.One big difference, of course, is that Bob doesn't have the vocal purity that the Louvins did, so perhaps he would have done better in a rougher style, drawing more on blues-, country-, and R&B-based Christmas songs (including the Louvins' own holiday song \"It's Christmas Time\"), rather than holiday standards. One possible alternative model might have been Ben Keith's Christmas album \"Seven Gates,\" which had less polished but well-played arrangements and featured guests like Neil Young and Johnny Cash (not that I would have wanted one of those cheesy \"guest star\" albums -- which Ben's is not). Ben, who is a longtime steel guitarist for Young, did include well known Christmas standards on his album (overlapping some with Bob's selections), but he also used some less known holiday songs, and the arrangements give them all a consistent style that works well, in my opinion. Bob has done something similarly successful.Christmas songs can be hard to do right unless the artist chooses the right songs and right arrangements for his/her personal style. So I understand that some folks might not go for this album, esp. those who don't think Bob should record other songwriters' tunes or those who don't like the more polished arrangements of much holiday fare. But I like holiday standards, and I like unusual versions of those songs in unexpected styles -- and that's what Bob has given us. (Plus I actually wrote to Bob's XM Radio e-mail address about a year ago to suggest that he record a Xmas record -- no kidding. I'm absolutely sure that I had nothing to do with him doing so, but even if not, he gave me what I wanted.)And it's very, very cool that he's donating the proceeds to charities that feed the hungry.

{"text": "I had a dream about five or six years ago that Bob Dylan had released a Christmas CD. No joke. Now it seems that the dream has come true. I can not believe the type of reviews that I've seen for this thing. Critisizing just about everything... from his voice, to his disloyalty to his Jewish heritage.  Hey... go back about thirty years and maybe your critisms will be relavant...If you've been paying any attention to to the Didge these last fifteen years, you will notice that he has been on a kick trying to span a wide spectrum of Americana and roots like material. This is just another entry into that style. Surely if 1960's  Bob Dylan tried to do a Christmas album it would be quite strange (in my dream it was like \"heeeeeee-eeeere coooommmes saaaaantahhhh!--\") but considering the stuff he's done of late, this is right up his street.It's fun... it's a bit comical, but if you put it on during the holidays, and don't tell anybody what it is... they'll either dig it, or won't know the difference from any other disc you put on. It's Dylans style of the last decade+ that I dig.  If you are still looking to him to be the voice of a sub culture, sorry, you missed the boat.

Who'd have thought!Years ago I saw Mabel Mercer when her singing voice had completely gone - she literally couldn't carry a tune (apparently it came back some, later), and her brilliant vocals are still seared in my memory. Many reviewers seem to feel their job is to judge Dylan's voice - that is, the voice of a singer who has spent forty-five years trying to convince people that each of us has the right to sound the way we sound. The question is not, \"What's wrong with his voice?\" The question is, \"What does he do with it?\" For my money, it's extraordinarily expressive. The \"beauty\" question seems to me to be entirely beside the point.I can't imagine anyone quarreling with the way Dylan sings \"The Christmas Blues,\" which is the perfect match of song and material. But I equally love the way he puts his stamp on traditional material. As I said, it's as though I'm hearing familiar songs for the first time.Two other points I haven't seen covered in these reviews: the backup singers have been compared to cheesy vocal groups of the fifties, but that's exactly what Dylan didn't do - instead, he used a very tight vocal group, few in number. If you listen to the backup group itself, it's quite remarkable.And finally, I have yet to see anyone mention this - the spicy picture of Bettie Page on the jacket - she became a born-again Christian!\n", "val": 0.014678321778774261}

{"text": "THE KEY TO BREAKING THE DYLAN CODE in CHRISTMAS IS IN THE HEARTor/ WHY CHRISTMAS IS IN THE HEART IS BEING USED ON DETAINEES INSTEAD OF WATERBOARDINGBy A. J. WebermanMany of the traditional Christmas songs Bob Dylan chose for CHRISTMAS IS IN THE HEART contained a phrase that was either identical with, or closely resembled, a line from Dylan's previously established body of poetry. In Do You Hear What I Hear he sang \"A song, a song / High above the tree\" In Tonight No Light Will Shine on Me he wrote, \"As the wind blows high above the tree\" In Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas he sang \"Here we are as in olden days / Happy golden days of yore.\" In Days of '49 he wrote, \"In the days of old in the days of gold often I repine.\" In Winter Wonderland he sang, \"In the meadow we can build a snowman / And pretend that he's a circus clown.\" In the liner notes to The Times They Are A-Changin' Dylan wrote \"An' I walked my road an' sung my song / Like a saddened clown / In the circus a my own world.\" In Must be Santa Claus he sang \"Who's got a beard that is long and white?\" In Tarantula he wrote \"the soldier with the long beard says go ask questions my son\" \"Soldier\" as \"American President\" In Gates of Eden Dylan wrote \"The savage soldier\" sarcastic; General Dwight Eisenhower accused by the far Right of being soft on Soviet Communism \"sticks his head in sand\" ignores historical precedents, (\"sand\" as in \"the sands of time\") like an ostrich \"And then complains\" then protests Soviet expansionism in Cuba \"Unto the shoeless hunter\" unto Nikita Khrushchev who took his shoe off and banged it on the Soviet Delegations desk at the United Nations in 1960. \"Hunter\" as Khrushchev; John Fitzgerald Kennedy: \"Khrushchev reminds me of the tiger hunter who has picked a place on the wall to hang the tiger's skin long before he has caught the tiger. This tiger has other ideas.\" Almost all American Presidents have been soldiers. Must be Santa Claus also contains this verse, \"Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton.\" These keys indicate the subcontent of this song concerns American Presidents.In The Christmas Blues he sang \"The jingle bells are jingling / The streets are white with snow\" In Mr. Tambourine Man he wrote this to his heroin connection \"in the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you\" and in House Carpenter he wrote \"Oh what are those hills yonder my love / They look as white as snow / Those are the hills of heaven my love / You and I'll never know.\" \"Snow\" is drug slang for heroin or cocaine. In Christmas on Christmas Island Dylan sang \"you will never stray for every day / Your Christmas dreams come true\" In I Threw it All Away Dylan wrote \"take it to your heart don't let it stray\" and in New Morning he wrote, \"this must be the day that all my dreams come true.\" Both these poems appeared on the same LP and were translated as drug related.In The Christmas Song Dylan sang \"Will find it hard to sleep tonight\" and in The Mighty Quinn he wrote, \"Nobody can get any sleep there's someone on everyone's toes / But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna wanna dose.\" The Christmas Song also contains the lines \"They know that Santa's on his way / He's loaded\" slang; drunk or intoxicated \"lots of toys\" \"toys\" junkie slang for narcotic paraphernalia, works \"and goodies\" and dope. The song ends \"see if reindeer really know how to fly?\" \"fly\" get high. Dylan's Santa Claus is loaded on smack and bringing dugi to all the little kids to get them addicted. Not since Alistair Crowley composed hymns for the Church of England that covertly praised opium have Christians been hood-winked neither in this fashion nor on a grander scale.In Little Drummer Boy Dylan sang, \"I am a poor boy.\" In If You Gotta Go, Go Now he wrote \"I am just a poor boy baby trying to connect.\" \"Poor boy\" translates as \"Leftist folksinger\" in Tarantula he wrote this to the folk fans who witnessed him being jeered at his concerts, \"you were also there when they castrated that poor boy in public\" In Can't Ya Hear Me Crying 1961 he prayed for a break as a folk singer \"Hey, stop you ol' train, Let a poor boy ride.\" With this key we can break the Dylan code and find out what Dylan is really singing about in Little Drummer Boy.\"Come they told me\" listening to Woody Guthrie records told me \"A new born King to see\" to visit Woody in the mental hospital where the Communist Party USA had dumped him \"Our finest gifts we bring\" my finest songs to play for him \"To lay before the King\" to lay on Woody the King of Folk Music.\"So to honor Him\" so in his honor, not that I ever believed any of the Communist agitprop \"When we come\" when I met him \"Little Baby, I am a poor boy too\" I told Woody, who was of diminished capacity that I was a genuine Depression Era folk singer \"I have no gift to bring, That's fit to give a King\" and that I could never live up to the high artistic and communistic standards set by Woody \"Shall I play for you, on my drum\" and I asked him if he wanted me to drum up support for the Communists with my music.\"Mary nodded\" the Motherland, the Soviet Union gave Dylan the OK \"The ox\" the rank and file Communist Tarantula \"now the organizers must bring the oxen in & dragging leaflets\" \"and lamb\" and those the Communists who are going to be sacrificed for the cause \"kept? time\" dug Dylan's folk music beat \"I played my drum for Him\" I wrote songs to advance Communism \"I played my best for Him\" that were some of the best ever written \"Then He smiled at me, Me and my drum.\" and then Woody had his fellow travelin' Communists approved of me and gave me the Tom Paine Emergency Civil Liberties award for furthering Communism.

Not a trace of irony anywhere -- when Dylan evokes the sounds of Christmas albums past, he does so with admiration and love.

I have learned to not have expectations of Dylan, in concert or on disc. I also have learned not to judge his recorded stuff on first play. Most of his great music pushed against my ear on the first play, but after a few listens, captured me. He does have the \"blood of the land in his voice\" which positioned against the almost too sweet sounds of typical Christmas music, is interesting and sets it apart from elevater music. Most Christmas Music makes me think of shopping or Christmas at it's commercial worst. Dylan's music always hits me at some deeper level. That \"raspy voice\" as others describe it, got me \"in the spirit\", and reintroduced me to some long forgotten memories and feelings about the season. He has made this effort traditional, and yet lyrically and musically has made it his own. The fact that this was a selfless labor of humanity only adds to it's authenticity. I love it, but not as much as I will grow to love it, I'm sure. Thank you Mr. Dylan. You continue to offer something for which to look forward, in this \"too rediculous to live\"(Melecamp)existance.

I have to admit, when I saw a Dylan Christmas album mentioned on a site, I thought it was a joke and laughed out loud - I envisioned a SNL sketch.  Sadly no.First, before being accused, yes I am a Dylan fan having 20 or so albums. And I've much liked some more recent, dead voice, albums like Modern Times and Time Out of Mind.That said, why would anyone want to hear Dylan croak through Xmas tunes?  He sings 3 vague notes: low croak, middle croak and high croak.  Any resemblance to pitch is entirely coincidental. I won't comment on individual songs, as I found them all pretty much unlistenable.  The one I will mention is \"Must Be Santa\" which I *think* was done jokingly: the arrangement sounds like a cross between a polka and a Jewish folk song.  Odd, but not good. Hearing Dylan's croak over fairly standard Christmasy arrangements is just incongruous - and jarring.  It's neither what you want to hear from him nor for Christmas music.\"The Christmas Album\" is a jump the shark moment for most artists.  Bob has jumped before - think \"Saved!\" or \"Self Portrait\" - but has recovered to record some good stuff.  I'm wondering if this is it for him.I'll give him kudos for the charity aspect, but I'd rather send the charity money than ever listen to this again.\n", "val": 0.0001188467358588241}

The production values might have worked better in a stripped-down, barebones style, as were Cash's last two efforts. That seems more suited to such gravelly vocals than does the too-smooth arrangement employed. Imagine the difference in impact if using no more instruments than a single acoustic guitar and violin (and possibly a quiet bass in the background), without reverb or backing vocals, had been the direction taken. Oftentimes less is more; in this case, it definitely would be an improvement. Unfortunately, I can see this being parodied for years to come; I'm sure this was not his intent.

{"text": "The first reaction at hearing there was to be a Dylan Christmas album was amusement.Then the CD came out and I sampled it on a cheap stereo, wincing and cringing as I skipped across the tracks.Then I took it home and listened ... once that night and three times the next day.\"Christmas In The Heart\" grew on me.One could write a review of what it's not or what it *is.*The initial wincing was because, after all, Christmas songs are always sung by pure voices. Julie Andrews. Bing Crosby. Boy's choirs. That lets Bob out.But Dylan sings it wonderfully. Rough and  phlegmatic, sure, but soft and tender when he wants to be, holding a final high note for measure after measure when he needs to, and then there are the occasional -and surprising- grace notes.On \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" (this Gene Autry song is an excellent beginning, both for the singer and the band) and \"Winter Wonderland,\" he's a grandfather or a great-uncle singing to the kids, full of warmth and charm.On carols like \"Adeste Fideles,\" \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\" or \"O Little Town Of Bethlehem\" he could  be a homeless man in a shelter on Christmas Eve.\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\" could be being sung by a guy at the piano in a bar long after hours.Sammy Cahn's \"Christmas Blues\" could be a Dylan original.I don't believe I've heard anyone sing the verse to \"The Christmas Song\" before.As he's always done, he delivers the lyrics knowingly.This is not a typical contemporary Holiday CD. No duets (who would he duet with? ... Tom Waits would be redundant) and no searching for a Lennon or Joni Mitchell tune. No, the repertory is the stuff of Christmas 78s, 45s and LPs from Dylan's childhood and teen years ... I don't think there's anything here from after Dylan first hit New York in 1961. The well performed instrumentals and back-up vocals look back to 1940s and 1950s pop and country (excepting \"Must Be Santa\" - an accordian driven Mexican romp where the singers start out naming the eight reindeer and just keep going) and the \"Christmas Blues\" mentioned above.Listening to the intentional contrast between the purity of the backup vocals and Dylan's voice, I was struck by the thought that this might be what Dylan was wanting to sound like way back when he recorded his first album and sang about wanting to do some hard travelling, too, like Woody Guthrie and his buddies had done.By the way, Bob Dylan self-produced this album.

While his low-fi singing doesn't deter (and in fact enhances) his last couple of studio albums, it simply doesn't work on here, as Bob's voice has the finesse of a bull in a china shop.If I had to point to some highlights on here, I'll go with \"Here Comes Santa Claus\", \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\", and best of all \"O' Come All Ye Faithfull (Adeste Fideles)\", with Bob singing the first few lines in the original Latin words. Worst of all on here for me is \"\"Must Be Santa\", with is brought at breakneck speed, sort of like a freightrain barrelling down the tracks. Bottom line, I have no idea what Dylan really expected to bring with this album. Far superior to this album instead was Dylan's 2006 Christmas special on his XM radio show called \"Dylan's Rockin' Xmas\", in which Dylan brought a fantastic mix of Christmas trivia, stories, jokes and a whole bunch of Christmas-related r&b, ska, garage rock and tex-mex tunes.\n", "val": 0.0001523858227301389}

Please people stop criticizing Bob Dylan! This is a great Dylan effort, it sounds kind of old fashioned which is the sound Bob is leaning to these days. Its a fun album with Santa songs and carols done in the unique Dylan way, also an original song called Christmas Blues which is a good song too! I have beeen a fan of Bob Dylan now for 30 plus years, and have liked everything that he has done. This album did not disappoint me one single bit!

{"text": "So what's the difference between the regular and the Deluxe copy of this CD? The deluxe version contains 5 greetings cards bearing the same picture as the album cover which, I guess, are limited editions. Now back to the album.Listening to these tracks for the first time I assumed that Dylan 'BobCats' would buy this with a completely uncritical ear - and that these fans would probably be the same ones who'd hated 'Self Portrait,' now mellow and soft shoe shuffling along to 'Winter Wonderland', bopping to 'Here Comes Santa Claus'. But then I realised that Dylan has constantly added new generations to his fan base so it is more difficult to make predictions concerning his newer listeners. I didn't know what to expect but then, I thought, 'nothing will surprise me with Dylan.' There has been a lot of merit in his last four albums - though I believe they are over-rated on account of The 'BobCat' factor which must opine that the master can do no wrong these days. This album can hardly be judged alongside his recent studio work as it is pure Christmas 'Product' and, without its status as a 'Charity Record' would be less easily forgiven - though to many of his fans Dylan can do no wrong.'Christmas In The Heart' sounds as though Dylan has enlisted The Mike Sammes Singers/King Brothers and somehow pasted The Andrews Sisters into the mix. Where this album follows in the wake of his last couple of albums is in Dylan's ear for that 'Old Timey' music, reflected in the choice of album cover and in much of the music played on 'Theme Time Radio Hour'. This music oozes Christmas past.With the album playing on a continual loop I came to a deeper enjoyment of it as I listened, 'The Little Drummer Boy' is quite affecting in Dylan's burnt out vocal, 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas' which I confess to quite enjoying though not necessarily in the spirit I should do. Dylan intones rather than sings it. 'Do You Hear What I Hear?' [Ahem] 'The First Noel',[with a heavy Andrews Sisters sound] 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful', a slightly strained vocal as Dylan tries for notes beyond his reach and rasps out the latin verse with comic pronunciation; a frantic 'Must Be Santa Claus', a croaked 'Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem' and a mellow 'I'll Be Home For Christmas''. - '[I Guess I've Got] The Christmas Blues' sounded as though it could be an original but now I have the full credits instead of an info free demo I find it isn't. Another 'stand out' track is 'If You've Ever Spent Christmas On Christmas Island' to the tune of Patsy Cline's 'Have You Ever Been Lonely' and awash with Hawaiian guitars The whole concept is a link back to the late forties and early fifties, in particular to Bing Crosby purveyor of many a Christmas album. Dylan has included three of the songs most closely identified with Crosby--\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" (1943), \"Silver Bells\" (1952), and \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\"[1962]So what do I think? Well it's a 'Christmas Album by Dylan' - art imitates history. For back in the late sixties there was a rumoured bootleg of 'Dylan's unreleased 'Christmas Album' and there was even mock up art work and a tracklist. But considering I'm impervious to Dylan's X Factor this album grew on me with each listening and Dylan charmed his way so far into my consciousness that I was humming and singing along to myself as I went through the rest of the day.This is a 'Good' record but not a great one, there are few 'Great' Christmas records, though, 'A Christmas Gift For You' from Phil Spector'  is certainly one that I'll be playing alongside Dylan come Christmas. Unlike some of my detractors I can't automatically award 'Christmas In The Heart', five stars just because it is by Bob Dylan and the royalties are all going to charity.

{"text": "Oct 30 UPDATE: The more you hear it, the better it gets!If y'all don't \"get\" Dylan, then you gonna be disappointed, but this release will guarantee a COOL YULE for the rest of us.  Anyone complaining about the dude's voice is following the oddest cliche to plague Bob since he began recording.  This ain't \"American Idol\" material for you to judge, you either get Dylan or you don't.  There is so much passion and dare I say FUN in all he has released in the last decade, and having just seen him in concert this week in Hollywood, there isn't anyone alive or dead that has a better catalog of material, BOTH older and more recent to draw from.Regarding this holiday release, I would argue with a few of the song selections.  As a producer, I would have beefed up the production and played with the arrangements, but how the heck can you NOT have fun listening to this album?  I've read quite a few \"professional\" reviews of this release in the press, and you can tell the folks who actually listened to the WHOLE recording and those who sampled it.As soon as a reviewer starts in on his \"croak\" you know they don't know where it's at.  You want perfect pitch, buy Streisand.Do yourself a favor and listen to \"Must Be Santa\" all the way through for the Reindeer Roll Call near the end...Bob is having a blast and he was when I saw him in concert as well.  This isn't some old croaky dude cashing in on his past...it's a vibrant soul who is still more interested in reaching out and touching his audience than sitting back doing nothing or touring just to rehash the hits.I, for one, am tired of people trying to \"judge\" the man because that's all so irrelevant.  You accept what he has to offer and go along on the journey...because...it's always worth it with Dylan.  As with all of his recording in the last decade, this Christmas album is LOADED with fun.  Dylan is NOT some serious poet preaching to a world gone wrong, Bob is a BLAST!  It's NOT about seeing him as a legend, as a genius or as some silly \"rock god\" - I truly enjoy the groove he's been in recently and this album is PURE HOLIDAY FUN!\n", "val": 0.018788963556289673}
{"text": "I must admit I thought back to Self Portrait when I was listening to tracks from this Christmas offering from Dylan. I actually found, and find, some good songs on Self Portrait and would swap many of Dylan's eighties albums - and certainly Under the Red Sky for it. Then it was heresy for Dylan to pick old time music standards to compile an album. Later he would win some acclaim for his two 'roots' albums Good as I Been to You and World Gone Wrong though there were still mumblings about the need for a new album of original work - amusing considering how many old songs were wrapped up in his 'original work'. Today half of his charm is an old time feel and nostalgia that characterises his late work - awash with a late forties/early fifties feel.Listening to the record minutes after downloading it I assumed that Dylan fans would buy this with a completely uncritical ear - and that these fans would probably be the same ones who hated 'Self Portrait' now mellow, and soft shoe shuffling along to 'Winter Wonderland' bopping to 'Here Comes Santa Claus'. But then I had to remind myself that Dylan has added new generations to his fan base and that just how this record would be heard and rated by his newer fans was unpredictable. I didn't know what to expect but then, I thought, 'nothing will surprise me these days.'

Where this album follows in the wake of his last couple of albums is in Dylan's ear for that 'Old Timey' music, reflected in the choice of album cover and in much of the music played on 'Theme Time Radio Hour'.

However, while it's probably heresy to say so a lot of these tracks sound like Dylan singing these Christmas classics Karaoke style to the aforementioned Mike Sammes/Andrews Sisters backing - which I suppose is original . . . . today. It's now OK to 'Look Back'. In fact it's imperative if you want to keep on collecting Dylan's catalogue. It's a 'good' album, [hence the three stars] but not a great one. Can anyone make a GREAT Christmas record? Well, yes A Christmas Gift For You from Phil Spector [Digitally Remastered By Phil Spector] And I'm recommending that as an admirer of Bob Dylan who has collected his music for over 40 years.With the album playing on a continual loop I came to a deeper enjoyment of it as I listened, 'The Little Drummer Boy' is quite affecting in Dylan's burnt out vocal, 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas' which I confess to quite enjoying though not necessarily in the spirit I should do.

{"text": "They say you can't polish a turd, but Dylan comes pretty darn close here.For this reveiewer, it's a marriage of heaven and hell, as few things irritate me more than listening to Christmas Carols, yet BD is my favourite recording artist. I own every (official) album he has released,and chances are if he elected to release a cd of polka hits hummed to a cacophany of pounding saucepans, i'd probably buy it.That said, this is what it is: a collection of Christmas songs given the Dylan stamp.It's interesting in part because people normally concentrate on Bob's songwriting and neglect the fact that he is an incredible performer and interpreter of others' material. These songs may not hit the highs of \"Black Jack Davey\" or \"Two Soldiers\", but some of them - despite the familiarity of the material - feel like they wouldn't be out of place on a recent Dylan album. The arrangements are more than listenable, with a couple of winces thrown in here and there.Including the photo of Bettie Page in Christmas costume on the booklet may be Dylan's succinct and cynical summary of what's on offer here - the wolf has wrapped himself in wholesome garb.Perhaps it would have benefited from a later release closer to Christmas, but Dylan fans will buy his albums any time he chooses to release them. If you don't like Dylan - or haven't listened to him in 30 years - this probably won't convert you.It should be added that my wife - not a Dylan fanatic, but still enjoys some of his recent albums - didn't think much of this effort.It's probably best to listen to this cd alone.

{"text": "At first I was going to give this product a 3 star rating (right up the middle; half great, half terrible). The reason being, these are wonderfully orchestrated musical productions done in an old school style as (many have referred to in other reviews) reminiscent of traditional fifties style Christmas albums. The bad, Bob's voice is so raspy that at times the vocals seem out of place with the music.Upon first listen it was hard for me to imagine ever wanting to play these songs as part of my seasonal Christmas rotation of music. Bob's vocals just seemed too harsh and raspy for this kind of music.After listening to the CD a few more times it is now hard for me to imagine not playing them as part of my seasonal rotation.The reasons for my change of \"heart\"? For one, it is the \"heart\" felt way Bob delivers these songs. There is sincerity in every note. Almost like Bob knows his voice is hardly up to the challenge of covering Christmas carols in a very traditional fashion, but he wants to do it anyway because he cares about the themes. The other reason is, after hearing them a few times, I really started to like the harsh and raspy vocal. The joy that seems to emanate from Bob overcomes the lack of ability to deliver the vocals in the soft and melodic fashion I have become accustomed too on this type of music. Finally, when my three year old daughter fell asleep singing \"Must be Santa, must be Santa, must be Santa, Santa Claus\", I knew Bob did alright.As far as the deluxe packaging goes. I was a little disappointed that the Christmas cards were basically the CD cover combined with a stamp on the back referring to Feeding America. Would it have been too difficult to type \"Seasons Greetings\" or something inside the cards? These cards can easily be reproduced with a scanner, or you can make your own by just copying an image of the CD art from the Internet, adding a blank section next to it, cutting, and folding; they are the same shape and almost the same size as the CD cover art. Having said that, the additional cost of ~$7 for the five cards with envelopes (less than $1.50 per card) is very cheap by card standards.Finally, it is important to keep in mind this whole project is for the sole benefit of a very important charity.All-in-all, Bob got me and my family in the Christmas spirit and it is only October!

{"text": "When I first heard about Dylan's Christmas project, I must admit I thought it was a joke. First of all, Christmas In the Heart is not a new Bob Dylan CD. It`s a charity project.Dylan has loosened up over the last few years: He has finally stopped fighting his own legend. He recent records exposes humor, irony and is more playful than ever. It`s like he is thinking that life isn`t that serious after all. Dylan`s inspiration from traditional blues, jazz and music hall songs from the 1920 to 1950 is obvious. It`s manifested on \"Love & Theft\" from 2001 and is also the inspiration for \"Modern Times\" and is also recognizable on his more bluesy 2009 effort \"Together through life\".Dylan's Christmas album is in an odd way inspired from the same tradition. It gives me a kind of Dylan meets Disney, Sinatra and Andrew Sisters feeling. Dylan has simply made a Christmas record true to a musical heritage from the forties and fifties. His voice gives a new and sometimes unexpected feeling. If Santa has a voice, Dylan is probably the closest we ever get to hear it.It's strange, but I feel Dylan's genius comes true and all of the songs on the record grow on me.As a Dylan fan I think \"Christmas Blues\" and \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\" is the highlights of the album. \"Must be Santa\" is probably the only polka and the most up-tempo song Dylan ever has recorded. It`s great fun and is also expected to be the soundtrack for the video from the album. However the quality of this record is so high, that I am not able to spot one weak song, if you buy the idea and intention with this project.Many Dylan fans will claim that this is the worst Dylan record ever. I disagree. I think it is a hilariously funny record, based on good musical craftsmanship. Some of the songs express a kind of enjoyable madness. It works in a mysteriously way. I believe \"Christmas In the Heart\" will find it's natural place in many people's Christmas tradition, also among Dylan fans after the first shock.This album is not a new Dylan record. It is a very funny and entertaining Christmas album from Mr. Dylan. He has made a classical Christmas album - in some way or another. This is probably the most interesting Christmas record ever released and Dylan has put a lot of effort and energy in doing this right. I love \"Christmas in the Heart\" and I tend to define it as a Dylan holyday masterpiece. It`s that good!\n", "val": 0.01722474955022335}
{"text": "Contrary to widespread opinion, Bob Dylan is in fact one of the greatest singers of popular music, in addition to being indisputably the finest songwriter of his generation.Why a great singer?  Precisely because his untrained, unpredictable, technically limited voice has reached, moved, and transformed the lives of millions of people.The Christmas album reconfirms that whatever Dylan chooses to do, he redefines it in ways that no one can ignore.  It's been almost a half century since he released his first album and he still ignites as much debate as ever.  Love him or hate him, Dylan commands attention and, more often than not, respect and affection.He is an American original, in the same league with Marlon Brando, Muhammad Ali, Gertrude Stein, Jackson Pollock, Bessie Smith, Emily Dickinson.  Even if you don't care for his music, you know I'm right.  If you don't like Bob Dylan, I have to wonder if you like the human heart and democracy.The finest tracks on this holiday feast of an album include \"The Christmas Song,\" \"Must Be Santa,\" and my favorite so far, \"Little Drummer Boy.\"Purchasing this record is an affirmation of Dylan's artistry, undimmed as he approaches age 70, and a good deed for the homeless and hungry in our troubled nation--a nation that Dylan understands, interprets, and celebrates in his career and life.\n", "val": 0.06826678663492203}

Of course, you probably have to be a Bob Dylan fan to enjoy it, or maybe not.Basically, Bob takes some traditional Christmas songs, recorded in very traditional Christmassy fashion (complete with appropriate packaging), and belts them straight out, as if he thinks he sounds like Bing Crosby, with no apologies for his aging but still effective voice. Personally, I still like the way he sounds.

I know that the basis for this collection is to raise funds for the hungry and the homeless, but as one reviewer said previously, you had better not actually listen to this as it will promote vomiting on a tsunami scale and you will need to eat. One should never hide behind a good cause to produce this rubbish. What could Bob have done? ,maybe even write some heartfelt lyrics about the hungry and the homeless with a Christmas theme, some new songs ,something worth collecting and then people would feel justified in spending the money for a good cause, instead he produces a flatly and badly sung,growled,grunted cheesy elevator rendition backed of the usual over worked Christmas ditties. He never could really sing and now he just makes that ever so obvious, by making himself out as some frost bitten wineo who has rolled off the tracks into the studio to record this collection.I was disappointed with Modern Times, and thought the slide was really accelerating  and now Bob in old age is simply a joke. 5 stars for the sentiment behind the project, but if this was intended to be a farce and a sendup of some discription, and actually a comic album, then it might stand buying but only playing half of the first song to friends as a joke and saying \"Its nearly as funny as listening to Stephen Hawkings singing \"Whole Lotta Love\", and then actually getting that out to listen to.

Do you hear what I hear, indeed!I'm just kidding, of course.What I REALLY like about this Dylan album is you can't deny it. Like a Vulcan at a Flat Earth Society convention, you can't convince yourself it's real, as opposed to previous, more subtle \"joke albums\" -- like \"Blood on the Tracks\" and \"Nashville Skyline\" with its muppet-yuppie dichotomy -- which, much like Soviet-made RPGs, failed to deliver their payload.\"Christmas in the Heart\" (which translates to \"Christmas with Whitey\" in English) is a big FU at WASPs and the whole \"apple pie\" crowd with their super size, bite-size, new and improved spending implants pulsing and staining their scalps. It's more tasteful than Andres Serrano peeing in a glass or Piero Manzoni crapping in a can, but just as anti-establishment. When Bobby D belches out the refrain on \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing,\" triggering your one memory of Grandpappy Brick drunk at the kitchen table, swinging his stubbly potato head wildly, fists pumping the air as he howls TV jingles at top volume, you can feel Dylan's middle finger bristling your nape.It was an added bonus to find out that all these songs are Dylan originals.

{"text": "I've had this album one day and have listened to it more times than I have his last album Together Through Life, which I thought was okay but found to be a generic modern-day Dylan album (some minor key blues, some rewritten tunes from other artists, some attempted crooning).  Christmas in the Heart is not perfect - Bob's \"O Little Town of Bethle-Phlegm\" voice occasionally struggles to reach the right notes, and he sometimes seems so intent on singing the actual melody, he can't quite invest the proper amount of emotion in the songs - but this album is warm and sincere.  It makes me smile.  The retro sound makes me remember what Christmas used to feel like when I was a kid, and gives me hope that someday Christmas will feel like that again.  My favorite tracks: \"Must Be Santa\" (Bob's actually having fun!), \"Christmas Blues\", \"Little Drummer Boy\" and \"Christmas Island\". Those who don't get Dylan, especially latter-day Dylan, will hate this album or write if off as a joke, and that's fine with me.  Dylan always has been an acquired taste.

Frankly, I have to side with the disappointed. They are right: The arrangements are pleasant and the musicianship top-notch, but Bob is not in good voice here. In fact, he makes Tom Waits sound like Perry Como on this CD, and I love Tom Waits. I stll love Dylan and his lifetime of work, and, yes, I bought and listened to the album, and, no, I don't expect him to still be the Dylan of 1965, and yes, I do give to the poor and hungry, but I'd understand and forgive anyone who says they'd prefer to listen to something else this Christmas.\n", "val": 0.00023644806060474366}

I purchased this album and to my surprise, I actually think that it's a stronger album than TOGETHER THROUGH LIFE. The band sounds tighter and it really grooves. You can tell Bob is having fun recording this. His voice sounds like it has sustained years of touring, Whiskey, Cigars, and Booze, but it sounds as powerful as ever. It contains a strong energy and encompasess many different and eclectic sounds.The first track: \"Here Comes Santa Claus.\" This has a sound that if you just imagine, it brings back a time of Christmas Trees covered in Tinsel and Salvation Army bands performing in front of Goldblatts. Presents under the tree consisted of Lionel Trains, Wooden Sleds, Tinkertoys, and  Baseball Mitts. It has such a nostalgic sound that pure holiday magic comes out of your speakers. \"Winter Wonderland\" is a fun a swinging rendition that borders on satire, but has just the right touches of fun and parody.\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\" sounds like a song to walk home in the snowfall, after closing a bar, looking at Christmas lights. It, ( like TOGETHER THROUGH LIFE) borders and parallels a distinctive Tom Waits sound.Understand that this is not a Christmas album for everyone.  You probably won't hear this at a company \"Holiday Party.\" But it IS a good listen and a very pleasant surprise. Buy this CD, support the cause and Happy Holidays!\n", "val": 0.041790109127759933}
{"text": "Who would have thought? But who should be surprised when Bob Dylan gives us the unexpected? He has never been afraid of taking chances.I've read some pre-release dialog between people who were speculating about Dylan's religious views - Is he really a Christian, a Jew or what? I don't know for sure. I suspect he is sort of both - if that's possible, and I'd say he is humble and sincere about it. But it would be hard to fit him - or for him to fit himself - into any strictly orthodox mold. And so with his music, and so we are better off for that here with Christmas in the Heart.In short, I think this CD is a delight. To me it often has a sort of 1940s flavor; maybe if Louie Armstrong and Leon Redbone did a Christmas album with the Andrews Sisters it would be like this. It can vary from playful at one moment to touching at another.Of course this is not Nat Cole or Perry Como, not your typical Christmas crooner. The voice is the gravelly Dylanesque some may not like. But I like it, as will many, I believe. You either get Dylan or you don't. And even some of his best fans at times want to grab him and suction the phlegm off his vocal cords - admittedly here more often than in other recent albums. Maybe he will do something about that.This CD, though, is unique and sincere (no parody - Dylan does not mock religion). And with some fine music, vocal accompaniment (unlike anything you've heard before with Dylan) and the variety of selections, it's a pleasure to hear - and yes, good for a few laughs too. It changes tempo and tone to keep things moving and interesting. He also gives us some interesting twists in the lyrics.I'm glad I bought it. I expect I'll be listening to it each Christmas season from now on. And it's for a good cause to boot.

The musicians play superbly, and Bob seems to be totally engaged in the music.  He sounds downright spritely on \"Here Comes Santa Claus,\" \"Winter Wonderland,\" and, especially, on \"Must Be Santa.\"  He delivers his versions of traditional Christmas hymns with reverence but without sounding dry.  Once again producing himself under his \"Jack Frost\" pseudonym, this may actually be his best self-production yet.  And, at 68, Bob keeps pushing that craggy voice of his to hit some high notes.  I find that in itself invigorating.\"Christmas in the Heart\" is a very good Christmas album, and a mighty fine addition to the formidable Dylan catalog.

She just \"gets it.\"Nellie's best by far is still \"Get Away From Me\" - a garrulous, madcap big-bang of long-brewed genius, in my opinion easily one of the very best records of the \"00's\". This would be her second best, in qualitative terms, to my mind and my taste.It is rare for an artist to cover a song as good as or - even rarer - better than the original. For the \"equals,\" \"They Won't Go When I Go\" by George Michael (covering Stevie Wonder), and for the \"betters,\" \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sinead O'Connor (making a silk purse out of Prince's plodding, lackluster original sow's-ear version) come to mind. Point is they breathed enough life into and wove enough of themselves throughout a given piece to hit or exceed the mark, which is super rare. Usually it's some starry eyed artist in love with a tune, feeling the reflexive need to spit it back out, when they don't realize their attraction and even obsession over it was due to it's already-there extreme high quality. And then they miss the mark. And I hate that.This whole record is quite in that vein of improvement or high quality deviation from the original. This is an artist who can take the bones of material and weave her own beauty around them.My exposure to standards is extensive; my exposure to Day is limited to like one record (\"A Guy Is A Guy\" being one stuck-in-my-head anti-highlight/minor guilty pleasure) and Pillow Talk. In other words, limited. But it's so cool to see a jazz geek getting geeked up about their niche fandom. Because I have one or two of those, too. Oh and Nellie is the hottest nerd alive. Mmmmm...hot nerds.Finally, the feather-pillow beating in the liner notes regarding vegetarianism...it didn't work. ;) Sorry, the stuff is just too tasty.- Matt Jacksonp.s.

{"text": "I'm an early fan of Nellie.  Nothing like her energy and in-your-face assertiveness can come close to her.  She is a brilliant instinctive songwriter and singer.  She's not nearly at that celestial level on piano (she's good, only not like Judith Hill, closer to pop divas Alicia Keyes and Imogen Heap).  She is determinedly idiosyncratic - she has a particular affinity for conservative 50's swing.  She is a charismatic performer (honed, like Bette Midler, at gay nightclubs).  Her earlier albums were full of clever music ideas and witty hooks, and her growth as an artist in the past has included distinguished undertakings in theater and film, while her songwriting has not matured.  But it's been a stressful passage, and she's feisty and brave; like the Dixie Chicks, she took on Columbia Records and won...sort of.1)  This album was a very good idea.  Nellie's kind of played out the role of intimidatingly brilliant ingnue, and this showcases her vocal talents better, I think, than most of her own songs do (maybe because in her own songs, you have to keep a close eye out for irony, word-play, and acerbic sarcasm...and here, she doesn't need either).Doris Day is a great choice for a retro album, partly because she, like Nellie, was smarter than most of the girls, and had to play the roles of big band girl singer, dumb pretty blonde, and undergo all the sexual harassment that was endemic for women in that era and industry.  She sued her corrupt management, and won.Underneath the 50s veneer, Day was a magnificent stylist in both big band and mainstream pop - \"Sentimental Journey\" and \"Secret Love.\"  Nellie's style evokes Doris Day without imitating her.  Unfortunately \"Secret Love\" is not on this compendium.  There's a reason for this, I think:  McKay has chosen to do a kind of, well, consciously *jazz* version of the songs.  That's unfortunate, because while she has great vocal instincts, the songs are poorly accompanied (e.g., \"Mean To Me\" has a delicious vocal, but is overpowered by gratuitous, busy guitar fills).  In other words, she has bad taste.2)  If she was going to do this album, I wish she had gotten an arranger, a la Linda Ronstadt and Nelson Riddle, rather than getting studio musician odds and ends together and improvising head arrangements in the studio.  (If her accompanist were Les Paul or Joe Pass or their ilk, that would be different.  But then she would have had to trust herself to a real producer and/or arranger.)And it seems Nellie won't let anyone have any creative role in her records.  It has to be PLAYED by her, ARRANGED by her, and PRODUCED by her.  In other words, she has bad taste, doesn't appreciate the value of a good arrangement or top studio musicians, AND insists that everything be done her way.  Here, that way seems to be low-budget jazz combos.Doris Day would have demanded strings, or maybe just a better producer.  Nellie McKay seems determined to have neither.  Reluctance to collaborate with better, more experienced musicians is not a sign of maturity.When Nellie grows up, she will be a powerful presence in pop music.\n", "val": 0.007306638173758984}

Great! Now, as for this piece of digital dreck... As several other reviewers have commented, McKay simply does not have the chops to sing most of the songs contained herein. Her voice is lacking the range and emotional expression that made Doris Day such a fine, underrated singer. Moreover, the song selections are mostly standards, done by dozens of other top singers through the years, so the collection is as much a tribute to Ruth \"Love Me Or Leave Me\" Etting as it is to Ms. Day. There are many lovely songs that Ms. Day recorded that are worthy of revival - \"The Second Star To The Right\" and \"A Very Precious Love\" are two that immediately spring to mind - but you will not find them here among Ruth Etting's Greatest Hits. As is her wont, McKay opts for cutesy-quirky whenever possible, so the lovely \"Black Hills of Dakota\" from the \"Calamity Jane\" score is done here as a monotonous Indian chant, hardly respectful of the composer's intent (but the only composer intent McKay cares about is her own) and a tedious musical experience. The least offensive tracks here utilize a fine little retro-jazz band and had the whole album been done in this vein it might have been listenable. By the way, how hard would it have been to include some prose about Doris Day's singing ability in the notes since this is ostensibly a \"tribute\" album? There is no mention of her singing career at all, only her animal-rights activism. Many of McKay's fans are under 40 and have no idea of Day's big-band training or her musical accomplishments. McKay is too self-obsessed to care. She has certainly failed to fulfill her early promise, and I doubt that she ever will. She was showered with praise and attention as a child prodigy, was blessed with early success courtesy of a major promotional push by her first label, and apparently let the great reviews for her first album (one of which I admit is mine) go straight to her \"Pretty Little Head.\" I would love to be proven wrong on this count and will follow with interest Miss McKay's growth curve (or lack of same). But the cute-quirky-offbeat schtick has got to go. It's worn out it's welcome.\n", "val": 4.972867463948205e-05}

Nellie's voice is in excellent form on this album; her voice is as clear as a bell and her sophisticated phrasing is impressive as always. The songs flow well into each other to make this a cohesive album; and it's a satisfying emotional experience as well. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is grand.There are several tracks on the album that stick out and really impress me, although they all have their charms. \"The Very Thought of You\" has a creative arrangement that is easy on the ear--what percussion, too! Nevertheless, the musicians never even try to steal the show from Nellie; she remains squarely in the spotlight which is perfect. \"Do Do Do\" just plain sounds good; and I like Nellie's treatment of \"(I'm In Love with a) Wonderful Guy\" from the musical \"South Pacific.\" Nellie's excellent diction enhances her performance all the more.\"Mean to Me;\" \"Crazy Rhythm;\" \"If I Ever Had a Dream\" and \"Dig It\" are nothing short of sublime. These four numbers are more than worth the price of admission alone! I love it; these tunes have great arrangements that fit perfectly with Nellie's vocals. \"Send Me No Flowers\" is gorgeous--Nellie makes this shine and I think you'll like her rendition of this song.The CD ends with \"I Remember You.\" This romantic, sentimental tune is especially lovely and memorable; and it also gives the album a solid closing number.Nellie McKay certainly does justice to Doris Day even as she reworks these classic songs a bit to put her own stamp on them. Anyone who enjoys classic pop vocals with creative, appealing and stirring new twists is sure to love this album.\n", "val": 0.05373130738735199}
{"text": "I watched Nellie Mckay performing almost all of the songs on her new album and was astonished by her latest songs. The lyrics are insightful as they always are, and this album follows a recurring theme, as with some previous albums. The album reminds me of old 50s and 60s movies, which follows the subtitle of the album, a tribute to Doris Day. During the concert, I learned more about Doris Day than watching any of her movies, yet I have to confess, I've only watched one of her movies. The album captures the essence of people like Ella Fitzgerald, in which on of the songs in a cover for an Ella Fitzgerald song, and Nellie's voice is just wonderful.There's probably a thousand artists who could do very soothing music, yet choose to do something more generic. Nellie's music in the album takes a step back and examines the life and career of Doris Day in a polite manner.\n", "val": 0.03253555670380592}
{"text": "I am an ardent fan of Nellie McKay's airy voice and quirky, original lyrics.  Nellie's talent rises far above the overproduced cesspool that is our modern music industry, and she has produced another gem with \"Normal as Blueberry Pie.\"  The one original song on this disc fuses perfectly with the covers Nellie selected from Doris Day's extensive canon.  In some respects, Nellie has come full circle from her debut.  A critic of her first album, \"Get Away From Me,\" described Nellie's complex persona as a combination of Doris Day and Eminem.  Now she has recorded a tribute to Doris Day that few contemporary singers could have pulled off with such a fresh treatment.  I hope we get a full disc of Nellie hip hop the next time around to showcase her less misogynistic Eminem side.\"Should have signed with Verve instead of Sony,\" is a memorable line from her debut disc that highlights another full circle evolution for Nellie now that she really has signed with Verve.  \"Normal as Blueberry Pie,\" her Verve debut, is definitively her best work since \"Get Away From Me.\"  I hope she has found a record company that will embrace her diverse talents and finally showcase her talents to a larger audience.  I played this album for my grandmother and she was immensely moved by a woman my age recording an album that could just have easily been released when she was a little girl.  Nellie's universal appeal has never been more apparent, and I think it will prove to be her ticket to greater success.  This is an album you must own and share with all generations.\n", "val": 0.03745794668793678}

It was good enough to make me want to drive home and hear it all again. A rainy day with Nellie McKay is my idea of heaven. \"Normal as Blueberry Pie\" is a sultry and fun record that would have fit in perfectly with the '50s, yet is a welcome and gorgeous modern sunbeam in the otherwise murky fog of autotuned garbage that's poured into our ears. On one hand, it's a shame to not enjoy the original songwriting skills of McKay as she's one of the best young scribes out there, but in her hands, the work of Doris Day is simply sublime. There's a love for the source material that's clearly apparent, yet they aren't straight covers, either. Prior McKay collaborator Bob Dorough and other jazz greats provide occasional backup to hold it all together. The cover art is bright and wonderful, as are the interior art surrounding the liner notes featuring a bunch of great vintage outfits she picked up from lord knows where. I recommend picking up the physical CD instead of an iTunes download for that very reason. A must for any fan of Nellie, Doris Day, or good songs in general.

In that one song, I heard the influence of Marilyn Monroe, Billie Holiday and, of course, Doris Day. I was instantly hooked and have been ever since. With this CD, her tribute, she does not disappoint. The talent, the radiance, the enthusiasm and the voice are all still there. That first night, I had to meet her and did and we became friends.

At times she sounds to have a pleasant voice, but the songs are so slow and tedious, this just makes one yearn for a different dessert like a nice rich slice of Devils Food.For good retro albums, Diana Krall is the queen. For great female singers of the original era, Peggy Lee cleans Doris Day's clock. Ella Fitzgerald, though, also should be considered too.

If ever there is an artist who would never do a tribute to Doris Day, much less name it 'Normal As Blueberry Pie,' Nellie McKay is the one!\"(Well, no, I didn't say that.  But if the subject had come up at that time, I most certainly would have!)And, here we are....It is clear, however, that this is not a tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-hip tribute, but a genuine, loving one.  The liner notes and cover make it clear:  Doris Day, above all else, was an animal rights activist; and judging from the cover and from the quotes in the notes, from Buddha and Einstein to Dick Gregory and Bill Maher, Nellie McKay is as well.I love this tribute!  Each song is a soundscape in and of itself.  We have the calliope feel of \"The Very Thought of You\";  the dreamscapes of \"Meditation\" and \"I Remember You\"; the Dixieland rag of \"Do Do Do\"; the Indian flute of \"Black Hills of Dakota\"; the hard swing of the infectious \"Dig It\" (a neglected Johnny Mercer tune); the hoedown feel of \"Crazy Rhythm\" (complete with Nellie \"shooing\" away that darned rhythm); the country-porch feel of \"Mean to Me\"; the dreamy vocal McKay original, \"If I Ever Had a Dream\"; and the swingingest version ever of \"Close Your Eyes.\"  Major kudos to the producers, who just happen to be - Nellie McKay (and Robin Pappas).And the thing I admire about this recording, above all, is Ms. McKay's artistry.  I love her choice of instruments that she plays throughout - for example, the liner notes don't say \"Jamaican steel drum,\" but the synthesizer on \"Sentimental Journey\" sounds just like one.  And in this recording, she rounds her voice consistently so as to affect a pitch-perfect, vibratoless tone.  She apes Doris Day's wide-eyed innocence without mocking it.This is one of the most fun albums in years.  It is as tasty as Boston Cream Pie.  To all involved in this project - well done!!

However, please allow me a few mildly negative remarks, which I am sure ardent fans will not find \"useful.\"  I write them in order to guide folks who may not be familiar with Ms. McKay's music.When I think of Doris Day, I think of a vibrant, happy, spunky woman-in spite of whatever reality might have been.  The many pictures that adorn the liner would suggest the same of McKay.  The visual art is highly incongruous with the mood of the singing, which is bluesy and dreamy.  Given my expectations, I found that some of the interpretations were joyless.  McKay's style in itself is actually quite good.  I think the mismatch between expectations and music diminished my initial listening pleasure.  However, the more I listen, the more I appreciate the vocals, as they stand on their own merits.The musical arrangements are not nearly as strong as the vocals and range from good to passable.  Aside from their musical qualities, these arrangements result in some interesting harmonics (especially from the horns) that tend to interfere with McKay's voice on my high-end audio system but sound much better from my computer's built-in speakers.

I personally know of no one of her era who could create a greater sense of personal intimacy in song than Day at her best. She possessed a crystal, bell-like quality to her voice.

Nellie McKay is as good on stage as she is in the studio. And her approach to Doris Day tunes serves both as an homage, but also as reinstatement of classic torch singing and soft elegance. The covered Doris Day I expected to hear was not there, but all for the better. Nellie McKay avoids all of the overdone Day pieces, selecting works that go back far before her Que Sera, Sera era. McKay channels through musical time periods with aplomb, while ever so gently showing her gratitude to her hero through excellent renditions. McKay also uses some instruments that become a more contemporary feather-in-the-cap of the songs. All-in-all an excellent album. It proves McKay's breadth as a consummate performer and singer. Some people may feel the return to yesteryear's music means Nellie has lost her much lauded acerbic tongue and wit. Not so. If anything, she shown us how important a bit of old school syncopation can be in an era of engineered music. Even my relatives couldn't stop listening!\n", "val": 0.009855194017291069}
{"text": "To my knowledge, there have been four CDs in recent years that were prepared as tributes to Doris Day, three of which I now own. (The other two I own are by Karen Oberlin and Pam Munter.) While the other two really make no effort to sound like Doris Day, it seems that Nellie McKay tries for more of a common style. And to a large extent she succeeds, but her voice is nowhere near a expressive as Day's. But yet, she isn't bad, when you get over comparing her with the original.Of the songs on the CD, one (\"If I Ever Had A Dream\") is Nellie McKay's own composition, but she apparently made sure to make it sound like the kind of song Doris Day would have sung back at the height of her popularity. Another (\"A Wonderful Guy\") is one that (as far as I know) Doris Day never recorded, though I guess it had to be included since the album's title comes from the lyric of that song. The others are all associated with Doris Day, though in one case (\"Send Me No Flowers\") I don't happen to own a copy of the original to compare. But after giving a listen to the whole album in the order in which it was put together, I listened again to all the other songs, first in the Doris Day version (for \"Sentimental Journey,\" two Doris Day versions, the 1945 original and a 1962 remake she did for the album \"Doris Day's Sentimental Journey\"), then Nellie McKay's recording. In each case, the effect was the same -- she can't match Doris Day, but she still carries it off pretty well.I was not certain as to whether to give this album 3 stars or 4. However, I decided that part of my negatives come from comparing the song versions with Doris Day, my absolute favorite singer, so I need to give this album the benefit of the doubt and give it the higher rating for the sake of fairness.\n", "val": 0.0023397915065288544}

{"text": "I'm posting this review to offer a somewhat contrarian view.Back in the day, I liked Kansas, though I wasn't a 'superfan' by any means. Considering the predominance of 5-star reviews, I thought I'd take a stroll down memory lane and give this DVD a try.  Unfortunately, it turns out that I can only rate it 3 stars because I don't anticipate that I'll be watching it often in the future.The main reason is that the guitar is fairly muted in the mix, instead largely replaced with the orchestra.  In my opinion, this takes a lot of rock edge away from the music and makes it sound somewhat low-energy.  This just isn't the high-power progressive rock band I remember.  My favorite track is actually the bonus track, where they're jamming during the soundcheck without the orchestra.While this DVD may be a must-have for serious Kansas fans, it may be a pass for the rest of us.\n", "val": 4.923793676425703e-05}

{"text": "There is no quick way to review this work. First, as a disclaimer, let me say that when I was a senior in high school, I became an instant fan of Kansas. 'Icarus: Borne on wings of Steel\" became a theme song. I am very glad it was included here. \"Leftoverture\", in my mind, was the bands peak, and like many other bands, the work that followed didn't live up. As an old fan, I appreciate this DVD despite it's shortcomings. While it would have been nice to see all the original members of the band, after 35 years that isn't really practical. The music, the songs which the band performs, makes the video worth the price. However, something is definitely not up to par in the filming. The absence of cameras in front of the stage is the first thing that popped out. Capturing specific members of the band in good light also seems amiss. Picture clarity is somehow lacking. There are too many wide-range camera pans which include too much of the audience, and not enough focus on the band members who somehow appear to be too spread out on the stage to make for captivating concert footage.That's not to say 'Don't buy this video'. I mean, the price to pay is small, and the music is what is really what it comes down to. Despite it's drawbacks, there is no question in my mind that I will watch it and enjoy it over and over.\n", "val": 3.3237669413210824e-05}

Walsh's voice seems an octave lower, but still good.  What really bothers me is the reverb on his voice.  Way too much reverb and when he sings loud it seems like his microphone amplifier is distorting quite a bit.  This is a mellow concert for a more refined group of Kansas fan.

{"text": "Well, I just did something I hardly ever do...I watched a music video from start to finish without a pause or skipping a song.  And when it was over, I wished there was another volume.  It was that good.  I have been following this progressive rock band since 1974, and if anything, they have gotten better with age.  Even though some of the members have come and gone, the band lives on, and rocks the house just like they always did.  I found myself brought to tears when it was all said and done, and had to just sit there and compose myself before taking it out of the player.  Even though I miss Robbie Steinhardt and his stage presence, David Ragsdale was a more than competent replacement, and even added another guitar to the band at times to augment his violin.In short, if you EVER listened or watched Kansas as I have over all these years, then you simply MUST add this video to your collection.  You will never be the same, and won't be disappointed.  Just moved.  If I had to summarize it in one word, it would be \"MAGNIFICENT\"!!!!\n", "val": 0.013166116550564766}

{"text": "I was expecting great things when I first bought `There's Know Place Like Home,' but the sheer quality of this DVD came as quite a surprise to me. The picture is amazing; simply brilliant with a really spectacular job in both editing and camera work which makes the DVD just so enjoyable to watch.The sound is unbelievable; one of the best concert recordings I've come across, the concert boasts one of the greatest live drum sounds ever captured, with a huge `feel the air particles moving,' kick drum sound, a clear sharp snare sound and perfectly mixed cymbals. I have a few DVDs where rock bands play with an orchestra and I honestly believe this concert implemented the idea the best, working to augment the material instead of dominating it.The stage looks fantastic and the lighting is really impressive, giving the whole show a really epic atmosphere, appropriate during material like the `Howling at the Moon,' section of `Magnum Opus,' or the very grand `Miracles Out of Nowhere.'Then on top of all that, the tracklisting is excellent, paying particular focus to the classic era; all the fan favourites are here from radio legends `Point of Know Return,' `Dust In The Wind,' and `Carry On Wayward Son,' to prog masterpieces like `Song For America,' `Cheyenne Anthem,' and `Icarus: Borne on Wings Of Steel.'The bands performance throughout is amazing, from the incredibly intricate drumming on the proggier numbers, to the soulful singing on the ballads Steve Walsh's vocal performance on `The Wall,' is pretty breathtaking and all that before even considering the violin work. Take that into account then remember there's a top notch symphony orchestra and guest performances from Kansas veterans Kerry Livgren and Steve Morse and you can just imagine what a spectacle this 35th Anniversary gig really was.The Bonus Track, an extended version of the classic `Down The Road,' recorded in the soundcheck is particularly energetic and impressive.If you enjoy concert DVDs or are a Kansas fan then you can't afford to be without `There's Know Place Like Home,' in terms of performance, picture and sound this is simply one of the best DVDs out there.\n", "val": 0.04689105227589607}

I could have lived without Steve Morse, as I've grown so tired of shredding, and that's about all he has to offer.  Except for the \"bonus\" track of \"Down the Road,\" none of the songs require or benefit from shred, IMO.I hated the old stock footage they inserted a couple of times.

{"text": "After reading some of the negative reviews of this Blu-Ray, I am wondering if I have a different set of ears!  I got the opportunity of seeing Kansas in the early 90s in some club in Long Island, NY and Steve Walsh was in the midst of his drug induced insanity and compared to that performance I think he is amazing in this concert and his vocals are spot-on.  He is no spring chicken now, he was 59 when this video was shot.  The musicality of this group is phenomenal as well.  I personally am a David Ragsdale fan and he brings energy to the concert and a magnetism that draws you in.  I think the harmonizing between Billy Greer and Steve Walsh was amazing and they complimented each other, I do not think Billy was covering up the high notes for Steve Walsh whatsoever.  Also trying to be in-sync with a orchestra of this magnitude is difficult at best, and Kansas is the type of band that can pull this off with such precision. Musically, this is one of the best concerts I have ever seen and all I wish is that it was longer!  A must see for any Kansas fan and this concert can convert anyone who sees it into a fan as well.

Yes, everything was great!  \"There's Know Place Like Home\" is a great DVD to add to your Kansas collection.  I only wish I could have been in Topeka when this was recorded.  In the home town for this special event would have also been great.Of course, everybody is older...we all are.  We're talking 35 years, people.  I bought the first Kansas LP on 8 track tape!  Aside from missing a couple of my favorite players, the present line up of Kansas can still rock the house.  And the guest appearences of Kerry Livgren and Steve Morse were special.  I only wish they each could have played longer.  Both are favorites of mine.  Kerry was there in the beginning and Steve can always make a fretboard smoke.Steve Walsh still has the vocal chops, no matter what some say.  Rich Williams seems to effortlessly carry the guitar parts so necessary for that Kansas sound.  And is it just me, or does Phil Ehart never seem to age?  He's one of the few classics in rock drummers.  Billy Greer isn't just a bass player.  His voice is strong and clear, singing lead on the songs that Robby Steinhardt use to sing.  And although I miss Robby, Dave Ragsdale is back and he's nobody's second fiddle.It was nice to hear my favorite Kansas songs with orchestral arrangements.

It would have been nice if it could have been in DTS-HD Master Audio (or even Dolby TrueHD) but all-in-all the soundtrack was presented well.Even though they've had line-up changes over the years it was cool to see Kerry and Steve play on a few tunes and the BD is worth the price just for the bonus track 'Down The Road' filmed at a sound check with all guys playing....it was my favorite track on the disc.

This concert (and I have a collection of many other rock concerts by other bands/groups) is by far one of the best you will see. The camera work is especially appealing to me (and I think it will be agreeable to most) and the music quality and performance is first class all the way. I disagree with the review written by a friend from Salina, KS....the Washburn University Symphony only adds to the concert and does not distract, and I also think Steve Walsh is in fine voice and the harmonies are excellent.

The occumpanying orchestra is also a nice addition and works well with the selected songs.  The band itself plays extremely well and provides a very entertaining show.  Another band that has proven that their musical talents don't go away with age.  Most of the tracks are from their older albums, which suited me fine as I feel this was their best work.  There are a few newer songs too that I hadn't heard before,  but I came to appreciate them as well.  I especially enjoyed the bonus track of an \"audio check\" of the empty auditorium, which becomes a very good rendition of the song \"Down the Road\".  I believe other Kansas fans also would not be disappointed with this DVD.  One thing to note for surround sound listeners is that for some reason the default audio setting is stereo only.  You'll have to go into the audio options on the DVD menu before playing the DVD to be able get the 5.1 Surround sound audio.  This is especially odd because the \"preview menu\" is in surround sound without having to select it like you do for the show.  Perhaps its just my blu-ray player, but I don't think so.\n", "val": 0.033686716109514236}

{"text": "Kansas is a great band that doesn't receive the attention it deserves.  This performance with the Washburn University Symphony Orchestra celebrated the band's 35th anniversary in their homeland.  Thank goodness they filmed the event and released it for everyone to enjoy.The expected hits are here, but so are a great choice of album cuts which makes this more enjoyable for Kansas fans.I was a bit tentative when \"Ghosts\" was performed a bit differently compared to the original version from \"In The Spirit Of Things\".  It's one of my favorite Kansas songs mainly due to Steve Walsh's moving vocal performance. This slightly faster rework combined with a portion of \"Rainmaker\" works well and is actually a moving part of the show.Musicatto from \"Power\" was the first song with Steve Morse joining the band on stage.  He fires off rippling guitar runs and looks like he's having a blast doing it.\"On The Other Side\" and the moving \"Nobody's Home\" are other gems included in this show and the band plays them well.I'm always wary of Walsh's performance of \"The Wall\" because it varys so much.  I really prefer the original, but this is one of the better live versions they've ever done.Another real treat was seeing master songwriter Kerry Livgren join the band for a few songs where he played guitar and some keyboards.  This is one of the few bands that keeps in touch with, and gets along with former members (so where were Dave Hope and Robbie Steinhardt?).The bonus track \"Down The Road\" was performed (with Steve Morse joining in) during rehersals.  The band was on fire.Of course there is the orchestra.  They blend beautifully with the band throughout the show.The band's performance overall was great.  Steve Walsh and Billy Greer were in fine voice and David Ragsdale provided vocal harmonies. Richard Williams plays solid lead, rhythm and acoustic guitar, and Phil Ehart is a skilled drummer.  It was also interesting to see Steve Morse and David Ragsdale playing violin during \"Dust In The Wind\" (Morse played the solo live during his years with Kansas, but left the solo up to Ragsdale here). Kerry Livgren plays like he's been performing these songs on a daily basis.The only minor disappointment is the lack of extras.  I thought the package would include a behind the scenes documentary and interviews, like those on Kansas' website.

{"text": "I am old, and I am from Kansas.  I heard this band when they were new and saw them play many times over the years.  While I appreciate their embrace of their Kansas roots by producing a live DVD in Topeka's Washburn University auditiorium, and I thank them for past greatness and transcendent moments of musicality, this release is troubling.  Granted, Steve Walsh was one of the great rock voices in his day, but the magic is long gone. You just wince to hear how his voice has changed.  The symphony seems superfluous to music that already sounds syphonic as a six-piece ensemble, and I feel it dulls the edge of the rock sound in spots.  The video direction disappoints as well, with the director cutting to a wide shot just as Kerry Livgren launches into on of the most powerful, understated guitar solos of all time during \"Hold On\". (Someday I'd like to see a concert video that truly recreates the experience of sitting in the best seat, seeing the whole show at once, rather than some director's shot choices.)  The best track of this release is the bonus track of \"Down The Road\" which they recorded during the afternoon sound check.  This is the Kansas I love, rocking out hard and unencumbered by a huge symphony and the strain of making \"The DVD\". Steve Morse seems to scare violinist Ragsdale during this song! One could argue that this track, alone, makes it worth the price of the disc.  If you're a fan of the group, sans Robbie and Dave with only a cameo from Kerry, you need to see the show. I'm glad they made it, and I suppose having seen them in the old days is a handicap for us geezers on this one.

Walsh (always present within the classic line-up of Kansas) and especially nowadays...in particular Mr Ragsdale is so exciting in the execution regarding the classics by Robby Steinhardt and at the place of this latter He's very powerful anyway!!

Moreover, by thinking of \"Cheyenne Anthem\" (this latter an exciting song with a great symphonic progression) and the emotional violin of the ballad \"Nobody's home\" too, you have to listen and listen once again (but also the coreographic aspects of the video are not bad) and you can't ask for anything else!!Excellent quality record and the video as well!!\n", "val": 0.045686330646276474}

Steve Walsh is just a shell of his former self.\n", "val": 9.61882178671658e-05}
{"text": "Kansas is one of my favorites, I have ALL their CD's and the (few) concerts that were filmed (even saw them twice in the 90's).  I noticed that Steve Walsh started to \"lose\" his voice with the \"Freaks\" album (one of the few that was NOT represented here).  They still did quite a fine job with continuing to tour and produce music (Somewhere to Elsewhere is an EXCELLENT example-Thanks Kerry).  With the \"Device Voice Drum\" concert they still produced alot of energy and enthusiasum that made that concert special, however the QUALITY of the video was not good (only noticed it after my HDTV upgrade), and Steve still strained a bit.When this came out and I started reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to get it right then and there, however, \"in the cart\" it only showed the DVD (the blu ray was not out yet).  I cancelled the order and patiently waited a few more weeks.  When I got the blu ray, it was WELL WORTH it.  It has all the sharpness and clarity that alot of movies on blu ray even don't produce (some of the film stock is not quite up to par for HD). Combined with either stunning DTS surround or 2 ch PCM (my preferred format for music) you really do get the feeling like you have a front row seat for music history.Like other reviewers said, I was very surprised with Steve's voice.  Not only did he sound just about perfect (as he did on all of the studio songs way back in the day) he held off on the \"emoting\" he used to do when live (listem to \"The Wall\" over the years and you know what I mean) IMO it used to really take away from the flow of the songs.One thing I did notice (like others have said) is the energy of (newly reinstated) David Ragsdale.  It seems that, along with bassist Billy Greer, they took over the \"front man\" spot while Steve was back off the spotlight just singing and keys, in the \"Device\" concert he had a little more stage presence (although I would trade the perfect vocals with the performing any day).It was very good to see Kerry there, last I saw him (never live) was on my 82 VHS with John Elephante (where Robby announced the 10th anniversary of the band).  He is am amazing performer as well and have always enjoyed the few \"twin lead\" guitar solos they did over the years (What's on my Mind- wish they played that, it is my absolute favorite Kansas song), I have read he is recovering from his stroke and progressing well.The \"dueling\" violins during \"Dust in the Wind\" with Steve morse was very well done and he (Morse) is an amazing guitar player as well (I have always thought his style was NOT quite the \"Kansas\" classic sound though-at least it \"carried them on\" through the 80's).Overall, this has got to be my best concert video I have seen in years. The HD quality and the top notch performing make for a highlight for any time.  Thanks guys!!\n", "val": 0.017064319923520088}

The newer Kansas line-up is still fantastic and just to see Kerry came back for a few songs is a treat. Walsh's voice cannot hit the really high notes anymore but he still sounds great to me. Phil is a like a Swiss watch on drums, and Rich Williams sounds better than ever on guitar. Ragsdale fills in nicely for Robbie. It just seems weird not to see that big guy with all of the hair and the beard. Billy Greer sings Robbie's vocals but he doesn't seem to have the passion that Robbie had.

{"text": "There have been plenty of comments made on the venue and memories of rock concerts past so I will not go there.  For anyone with kids out there, this video should be mandatory viewing.  While I think there is plenty of talent in today's musicians, overall there is an incredible lack of creativity and for lack of a better word texture.  The music and lyrics of Kansas are thought provoking and timeless.  The performance showed artistry with each player showing full command of their instruments.  Without specifics and in all fairness - there is a mistake or two that musicians may notice but the gig is live and brilliant.  The footage is edited well and shows the band really enjoying the night and the atmosphere.  Steve Walsh and Billy Greer are in extremely fine voice and the harmonies (with David Ragsdale included) are spot on.  While it is a bit sad to see this concert without Robby Steinhardt, David Ragsdale could not have been better and displays virtuouso chops.  A few words about Steve Walsh - like everyone I remember what I believe to be one of the finest voices I have had the privilege to hear in my lifetime.  He has openly admitted to some poor decisions in his past and the impact it had on his voice and his life.  With that said, this performance is truly amazing and inspiring.  There has been some innuendo about pitch correction technology on other sites and while I am no sound pro - I frankly could care less.  There has been a steady improvement in his voice since Somewhere to Elsewhere (which was still amazing) and the inherent quality of his voice and talent is again at the forefront of the band.  Listen to Cheyenne Anthem - if you are not moved - you are not human. I have said this to many reviews of the past - Steve Walsh at 70% is still remarkable.  While he has developed some techniques to overcome years of \"wear and tear\" my thought is simply, Bravo. . .  Would give anything to buy the guy a beer and thank him for sharing his gifts.  As for the rest of the band and the guest appearances by Kerry Livgren and Steve Morse and of course the Washburn University Orchestra - it just does not get any better.

{"text": "One word - EPIC.  This DVD is amazing.  Kansas is amazing.  Ehart, Williams, Walsh, Greer and Ragsdale joined forces with a 50-piece symphony for an unforgettable performance.  Let's get down to business!  Steve Walsh has shocked me and delivered an absolutely knock-out performance.  He hits every single note and his voice sounds fresh and vibrant.  This was the best I've heard him since 1990.  He especially shines on \"Ghosts, \"Nobody's Home,\" \"The Other Side,\" and \"Dust..\".  Ehart's drumming is so powerful and it's such a pleasure to watch his technique.  Greer was fantastic on bass and even more so on the backing vocals.  When he harmonizes with Walsh a great blend is created.  Rich Williams was really on his game, especially on \"The Wall\" and \"Carry On\".  But the guy who was the most impressive and fun to watch was Ragsdale.  This guy has such flair and showmanship.  As good as Robby Steinhardt was, Ragsdale is a flashier and more exciting player.  If this wasn't enough we get guest appearances from Kerry Livgren and Steve Morse.  The latter plays such a fiery lead on \"Musicatto\" it's hard to believe he's human.  Livgren was exceptional as well and it was cool to see him playing a pipe organ during \"The Wall\".  Of course there are 50 other stars of the show - the symphony.  Their performance added such beauty to all the epic songs and meshed so well with the band.  It was truly a match made in heaven.  \"Nobody's Home\" was especially moving.  The conductor was fun to watch too.  Quite simply, this DVD captures Kansas on one of their very best nights.  It should also be noted that the camera work and lighting are spectacular.  Without question this DVD not only blows Live At The Whiskey and Device-Voice-Drum away, it obliterates them.  The setlist is comprised from 10 different albums, so there's something here for Kansas fans of any era.  No fan should be without this gem.  Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.05377675220370293}

I also witnessed a band that should still be taken very seriously. First, I'm a hugh Kansas fan along with other Prog Groups like Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Spock's Beard, Neal Morse and others. I've collected all Kansas recordings, DVD's, along with these other groups. Device Voice Drum is a fantastic quality DVD in both picture and sound and wondered how they could outperform that and compete with live DVD shows from these other groups. They did, flat out. The lighting, picture quality, sound, camera angles, orchestra, guest players (Kerry Livgren, Steve Morse), song selection and group positioning, all make this a superior quality show for any Rock or Progressive Rock Fan. The Dream Theater Score DVD is exceptional, bigger than life,powerful,all encompasing and very emotional. This Kansas DVD in some ways matches this and in someways outperforms it. The show almost has a Trans-Siberian Show quality feel to it. If you've been to one of their shows you'll now what I mean. It's a production! With David Ragsdale as the front man the band has this youthful, high energy feel to it. In comes the legendary and visionary Kerry Livgren and what more could you ask for. Well you get one more thing, Steve Morse. Look and Listen to the Chemistry with Steve and David with the rest of the band. They absolutely look great together on stage. Talking about power,youthfulness and energy to go head to head with these other bands is envisioned. The original lineup could be fathers to players of some of these other groups but with David and Steve Morse up Front you have the link to really compete and raise the bar again with Prog Rock. By the way, Buy this DVD and listen to Musicatto and the Bonus Track Down The Road and you will see this enormous potential.

{"text": "My eleven year old nephew would like you to know:I love DUST IN THE WIND and at 99 cents I didn't even have to save up my allowance to get it. I play it in dad's car going to and from funerals. First it was my grandmother, then my aunt died...and then we took Nipsy to the pet cemetery. Nipsy was my cocker spaniel.The song was very helpful to me during those times. It suited the moment, but it's not a morbid song. \"Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky. Dust in the wind. All we are is dust in the wind.\"Everybody loses the thing that made them. That's the way it's supposed to be in nature. Some people believe when you die it's the end and some people believe that you go somewhere else, but nobody really knows for sure.If you like this song you're also bound to like TIME by the Alan Parsons Project.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Very-Best-of-the-Alan-Parsons-Project/dp/B000H2M270/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Very Best of the Alan Parsons Project</a>&nbsp;Thanks for reading this even though I'm just a kid.

{"text": "I recently saw Colt Ford & his large backing band, perform live at the \"Northeast Louisiana Delta Music Festival\", and I really enjoyed their performance. So, here is my \"take\" on this CD/DVD combo. (Colt is from Athens, Georgia).The CD is as follows:1. Buck 'Em (This was written for the Professional Bull Rider's Association.)2. Huntin' the World3. Big White Redneck4. Day in the Life, W/Andy Griggs from my home town of Monroe, Louisiana.5. Left Ya'll in the Dust (Nascar Song)6. Dirt Road Anthem (Recorded live at the legendary Suwanne River Music Park, in Live Oak, Florida - They have an annual music fesival there, and the Allman Brothers Band are Regular performers there. This song includes The Brantley Gilbert Band).The DVD (\"The Making of Ride Through the Country\" DVD):1. Intro (This contains mostly documentary elements).2. Colt Ford Tells it (this is some commentary by Colt Ford).3. Behind the scenes of \"Buck 'Em\" the Video, (This includes some professional bull riders, and some amatear mechanical bull riders.)4.\"Buck 'Em Video (this includes some professional bull riders (PBR's), riding bulls, and being bucked off.5.the \"Workout\" (show's Colt Ford working out to lose some weight)6. Dirt Road Anthem (includes some commentary)7.\"Ride through the Country\" (includes commentary)8. Behind the Scences of \"No trash in My Trailer\", the video.9.\"No Trash in my Trailer\" the video.10. Mr. Goodtime (includes commentary)11.\"Saddle Up\" (includes commentary)Overall, I wish there had been more music and less talk on the DVD, but afterall it is a documentary dvd, so you have to expect that. The overall CD/DVD Combo - it's still, well worth the price, if you like Colt Ford, and his unique brand of \"Hip-Hop\", \"Rap\", and \"Alternative Southern Rock\", style of Country Music.

Tobey Keith was a good friend and the recording at the first of the song is actually from Wayman's telephone message.  I cry everytime I hear it.  Tobey is an awesome singer and story teller.

They had smiles on their faces that made me smile.  When I heard this song on the radio I wondered who it was about and then I saw the video.

{"text": "First, this is coming from someone who cannot be counted as a previous Toby Keith fan (trust me), but as I viewed this beautiful video tribute to Wayman Tisdale during the intermission of the Dave Koz Christmas Show in San Diego, I had to see Mr. Keith from a different angle (especially with a tear in my eye).  I never met Mr. Tisdale but saw him several times in concert and he seemed like the coolest person.  My college roommate was also a huge Wayman fan when he played college and professional basketball, and even as a kid/young adult, he seemed to be cut from a different cloth.  Mr. Keith, with the help of Dave Koz (an interesting paring that again goes to show a different side of the artist than I had previously witnessed) has created a song that transcends country music, blending jazz instrumentation and sensibilities with a beautiful story and lyric.  It's a great, heartfelt song that is befitting of this giant of a man in every way.  It's nice when music can touch the heart and create an opportunity to re-evaluate one's own pre-conceptions.  Thanks for that, Mr. Keith...\n", "val": 0.033126141875982285}
{"text": "I'm not a big country fan but something pulled me back to this station as I was sailing past the video.  Wayman was such a big man - and I'm not referring to his stature.  Big Smile.  Big Heart.  Unlike some people who have gotten more press and then fallen from grace, he was a real family man, a man of faith.  Toby Keith gets it right.  When we mourn the loss of a man like this, if you believe in God, you believe he's in a better place.  If you don't believe in God, you certainly know he's no longer in pain or suffering.  So, why do we cry?  We cry for our loss.  And though I only met Wayman Tisdale briefly on the Cruise, it was clear he was the real deal.  As we cruise this year and sail into the rest of our lives, we will miss that smile.  Thank you Toby Keith (featuring Dave Koz, who is phenomenal) for this dedication.

{"text": "R-Swift is back in the building with his third major album release (following Revolutionary Theme Muzik in 2006, and Soapbox in 2008) titled \"Anthem.\"Overall, \"Anthem\" is a delicately balanced mixture of both high energy songs as well as some more laid back songs as well. Fans of R-Swift's previous two albums will most likely agree that overall, this latest release is the most laid back of R-Swift's works.That is not to say that Swift's blazing hot rhyme assaults do not make a bold mark on this project. Songs like \"Anthem\", \"Trap Muzik\", \"Back Up\", and \"Awesome\" prove that Swift is like a crouching lion ready to strike whenever the opportunity presents itself.R-Swift demonstrates his more subdued side and proves his versatility as an artist on \"The Beginning\" - a powerful track with a captivating and slightly ominous beat on which Swift expounds upon the realities of a sin tainted world. A world where sin is present within the human nature even from birth.In my mind, the stand out tracks on this album include \"The Beginning\", \"No No No\", \"Trap Muzik\", \"Back Up\", \"That Girl\", and last, but furthest from least, \"Awesome.\"\"Awesome\" does an absolutely incredible job of moving the listeners heart, mind, and soul towards worshipping the God of the universe and his indescribably beautiful son, Jesus Christ. This song will surely go down as being one of my all time favorites.This album has earned a Silver Medal from [...] and is a very highly recommended addition to any hip hop fan's collection.Here is a detailed breakdown of the album, where each individual song is rated:1.

{"text": "Mr. Fisher in his review below sums up the set very well. I'll just add some additional details.The six symphonies and the Romeo and Juliet are indeed conducted by Maurice Abravanel, and taken from a Vox Box set available elsewhere on Amazon. The Utah Symphony isn't world class, but they play very well, and the 1970s recordings still sound fresh, if a bit dry. Abravanel's dry-eyed Tchaikovsky sounds a bit underpowered compared to, say, Bernstein, and his orchestra isn't as lush sounding as Philadelphia, Vienna, Berlin, etc, but he's always musical, and his recordings of the early symphonies are very good indeed.The Violin Concerto is played by Aaron Rosand with the Orchestra of Radio Luxembourg under Louis de Froment. This was taped in the early 1970s and released on Vox. The recording is a little brash, with the violin spotlit, and the orchestra a little less polished than the Utah Symphony, but Rosand's playing is bold, and the result is a good performance. I find the sound less objectionable than Mr. Fisher does.Steel-fingered Michael Ponti released many discs of little-known music on Vox. The Tchaikovsky works, part of a complete set of the composer's piano music recorded in the 1970s,  found him a little more sensitive than usual. The hard, slightly clattery piano tone is typical of the label's sound at that time.The Nutcracker recording doesn't list a conductor, and credits the suspiciously named \"Bonn Classical Philharmonics\" as the orchestra. Pity, because this sounds like a fine Nutcracker in good sound. The chorus in the Waltz of the Snowflakes deserves to be named as well.\n", "val": 0.013350427150726318}

{"text": "Tchaikovsky is one of the most melodic, tuneful composers ever, which means his work is well suited for this kind of collection. This set is a great bargain, collecting great compositions by a great composer and offering them up for a terrific bargain price.This collection really does offer most (although not all) of Tchaikovsky's best. It has a full cycle of all six symphonies (minus the unnumbered \"Manfred\" symphony), the incredibly recognizable Piano Concerto No 1, the Christmas favorite Nutcracker Ballet, the full-on Romantic-era Violin Concerto, Capriccio Italienne, Marche Slave, excerpts from Swan Lake, the Sleeping Beauty suite, the Romeo and Juliet overture, two full string quartets, \"The seasons\" set of 12 pieces for solo piano, and is capped off with the 1812 Overture -- arguably one of the densest collection of really catchy tunes ever assembled in 17 minutes of classical music, complete with cannon fire at the end.These are strong performances and recordings overall, mostly by ensembles that do not generally make worldwide headlines. The Utah Symphony under Maurice Abravanel does an admirable job on the symphony cycle (I believe taken from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/this-set/dp/B00005QKFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this set</a>). The Nutcracker by the Bonn Classical Philharmonics sounds as crowd-pleasing as ever. The London Symphony does a great job as usual with the piano concerto and 1812.Still, not everything is perfect. The violin concerto is a thin-sounding recording -- neither the orchestra nor the soloist are tightly microphoned. The string quartets were recorded in an overly echoey room and sound kind of muddy. The track listing indicates the Nutcracker Suite (Op 71a), but it really includes the full Nutcracker Ballet (Op 71) -- even though the suite would have been better for this kind of a collection since there are a few more boring bits in the full ballet. Also, artist information is sometimes incomplete -- no soloist listed on the Piano Concerto, and no orchestra on the Violin Concerto.Plus, there is an outright mistaken Track 77, which is supposed to be the aria from \"The Snow Maiden\", but which is in fact a hot jazz band with vibraphone and piano. Very strange, I trust Amazon will fix this?But never mind the nitpicking -- the set is highly recommended overall, whether at the \"Deal of the Day\" price of $1.99 on Thanksgiving Day 2009, or at the regular price of $6.99. The symphony cycle alone is well worth the price!(Regarding the price mix-up on November 26: I too bought the set today and then found it was $6.99 in the system instead of $1.99. Amazon issued me a full refund plus a promotional credit. Just send them a customer service complaint and you'll be refunded.

{"text": "GENEVA is a brilliant instrumental rock album -- post-rock, post-metal, call it what you will.  As some have noted, this music can be traced back to the progressive rock of the 1970s, but it captures the zeitgeist, it doesn't sound at all retro to me.Russian Circles is a guitar/bass/drums trio based in Chicago.  Their \"songs\" are shorter and seemingly composed with more intricacy than some bands in this movement that rely more on slow-changing drones (ie, Isis -- don't get me wrong, I love Isis...).  The title track is the heaviest, and the one singled out most often among fans.  It is also the most metal-sounding track on the album.  \"When the Mountain Comes to Muhammed\" includes a hard-to-hear recording of what sounds like an announcer talking about an atomic bomb test.  This track, the cover art (a grim, industrial, perhaps Soviet-style building), and the title (the Geneva Summit of 1955) subtly combine to suggest the Cold War as the central theme of the album.In any event, it is great, cinematic music, a perfect soundtrack for driving, or an apocalyptic film, or World War III.\n", "val": 0.005393370520323515}

I anxiously awaited Geneva and after repeat listens have come away dissappointed each time.  This album seems disjointed to me and quite frankly, boring.  The sense of urgencey that builds in their first two albums is definately missing here.  The band has always been good at tempering their agressive moments with beautiful, trance like rhythyms, but on this album it falls flat.  My advice-see them live and buy the first two!\n", "val": 4.5884215069236234e-05}
{"text": "Russian Circles is one of my favourite bands, if not my favourite. I've listen to Enter and Station countless times, soaking in every detail I can, finding something new with every listen. I hyped Geneva to no end, and it delivers on all fronts. Heavy, brooding, and absolutely beautiful.The first two tracks are absolutely relentless - dark, heavy, and unsettling. The album opens with a violin and a cello, fighting back and forth to play a single note, bending and twisting. Dave pounds the toms, and the song proceeds forward. The song ends the same as it began, which leads into Geneva. Absolutely massive and an incredibly dark atmosphere, Geneva is the heaviest song Russian Circles have ever written. Brian's bass work shows here, as the single best bassline in the band's history comes in about half-way through the song!The album then takes a turn with Melee, a painstakingly beautiful song with an incredibly creative and catchy drum beat at the beginning, with Dave playing 16th notes on the rim of his snare and the bass drum thumping on syncopated beats. It's brilliant, and the song as two very distinct parts that compliment each other wonderfully. Hexed All is one the softest songs on the album, and probably the softest song they've ever written (Xavii being the other.) Simple guitar melodies and bass notes are complimented by a very simple, repeated pattern on the drums, with the accents coming in on different beats as the pattern repeats itself.Malko is the next song on the album - an extremely aggressive track that starts with Mike's signature guitar tapping and ends in absolute chaos. A very short but destructive track.The second-to-last song is When the Mountain Comes to Muhammed, an incredibly dark track. It's the band's first use of any type of vocals. A sample from the Oppenheimer atomic bomb tests opens the song, which sets a very creepy mood. The song builds slowly as the man in the sample awaits the bomb's detonation, and when the wave finally hits, a sudden rumbling starts in the sample, followed by an unsettling nose from the guitar, and finally a bass melody that sets the chord progression for the rest of the song. The song concludes with an unexpected use of horns, which I found to be very, very suiting.The album ends with Philios, a track they previously released on a split with These Arms are Snakes. It's by far the most optimistic (well, the only optimistic) song on the album and features a brilliant use of strings and horns, which leads into a huge climax, which actually reminded me a lot of Red Sparowes, particularly the clean-sounding guitar strums.Geneva is a masterpiece, and is by far the band's most compelling album. I didn't expect to be disappointed with Geneva, and I wasn't. It features the best riffs, chord progressions, drum work, and bass work in the band's career, and there's not a weak track on the entire album. I cannot wait to hear what these guys release next.\n", "val": 0.015737436711788177}
{"text": "I've listened to Enter and Station about a thousand times each. I listen to three 'post-rock' bands- Pelican, God Speed and Circles. I'm definitely not a post-rock junkie, and don't jump at most of the other material out there. So, when it comes to these three bands- a release is major. Though I don't love every post-rock act, these three bands are very close to me and are always in my line up. Like I said, Enter and Station were phenomenal, I would rate them both 5 stars hands down. This album I got at a cd store the day before it released, and also heard it once through streaming online a month or two ago. Honestly, I was not blown away. This happened to me last year when Isis released Wavering Radiant. I was not blown away, but I gave the album its due- and have learned to love it. With Russian Circles and bands of the like, I expect to feel really intensely. The music is very emotional, and I want to be consumed by it. When this doesn't happen upon first listen, I don't freak anymore and stop listening. I keep listening because, like with Wavering Radiant, I believe there is something there. I give this album 4 stars because that one extra star is the immediate factor, when an album immediately effects me. It's already growing on me quite a lot, and I've listened a good handful of times through. Its as strong as any post-rock out there, thats for damn sure- but it doesn't hold up to earlier releases with emotionality. To me, the addition of strings and trumpets AND sound bites makes it not sound like Russian Circles. Now it sounds like God Speed. I expect bands to do what ever the feel, so the addition I am not surprised or angry with, I just don't think it suits them. It sounds like RC stepped away from their sound rather than building on it. I understand they tried a ton of new things this record, and thats awesome. I'm sure it'll only make the next one more spectacular. Before I finish- there are three highlights of the album. (I wish there was more!) 1st. Fathom. 2nd. The end of track 02 (Geneva). 3rd. The drum beat in the beginning of Malko. This beat is jaw dropping and inspires me every listen. Get the album! Get the other two also!\n", "val": 0.010487248189747334}

Perhaps a little lonely and chilly, but very meditative and stress free. There is a constant satisfying low frequency roar/woosh, missing from many recordings, and then occasional whistling gusts. This is consistant throughout the long recording with one exception about 3/4 of the way through, where the artist inserts a little highpoint- a slightly stronger, longer gust.\n", "val": 0.0018683170201256871}

{"text": "When I purchased this, I had only heard a few of The Almost's best tracks from their first album and enjoyed them immensely.  I'm definitely a fan of Underoath as well.  But, to say it simply, I wasn't very impressed with this album as a whole.  After the first three of four tracks, I was wondering if I had completely wasted my money.  But then it started getting much better.  Two tracks, \"Hand Grenade\" and \"Monster,\" are excellent.As a whole, they sound good as a band.  Surprisingly, Aaron's vocals weren't as strong as I've heard on previous recordings.  The drums rock, and the arrangements of some songs are really creative.  For me, though, there are just too many sub-par songs that sound like a not-as-good version of Paramore.I will listen again.  Maybe they'll start to grow on me.\n", "val": 0.00172143941745162}

{"text": "Enough good things cannot be said about this album. Southern Weather was a decent effort by Gillespie, but untimely forgettable. Monster Monster is a huge step forward for the Almost as a full band. Not only is this album catchy, but every single song bleeds with passion. This album is a diverse effort yet the entire album has a cohesive flow. Essentially the album is comprised of 8 pop/rock and 4 ballads. I am usually not easily impressed with ballads since most artists keep them relatively generic, however none of the Monster Monster's ballads fall into that trap.  Lyrically the album is nothing groundbreaking, but beauty is found in the simplicity of the lyrics. The album addresses our need for change; the title track states \"I have made a home among the thorns, and I have given in. I have lost respect for me, can this get any worse?\" The album is filled with many questions we all ask, and ultimately points to God as the answer. For those who like to put their songs on shuffle in huge playlists, these are the songs that you smile when you hear them.\n", "val": 0.00613167742267251}
{"text": "The Almost has done it again.  This time around Aaron has a backing band behind him (instead of playing ALL of the instruments like on Southern Weather).  The result is a more cohesive sound.  The best way to describe The Almost is if Adam Lazzara of Taking Back Sunday became the frontman of the Foo Fighters.  As someone who loved Southern Weather, I was hoping to not be disappointed by Monster Monster after hearing it was more radio-friendly.  But fear not!  It still has \"raw\" moments, but just excellent production (per usual) by Aaron Sprinkle.  And at currently $7.99, go buy it!\n", "val": 0.012116165831685066}
{"text": "The name Underoath has become a common one among... well, anyone who knows what Christian rock or metal is, and even those only familiar with the secular version of these genres. It's not difficult to see how such a talented band has gained the best of both worlds in today's music industry. And as most successful vocalists do, Underoath drummer/vocalist Aaron Gillespie created a side-project. But The Almost wasn't just any side-project. 2007's Southern Weather was one of the most successful side-projects Christian music had ever seen. And, just like Underoath, The Almost caught the eyes of those categorized by secular music, partly because of their Tooth & Nail/Virgin Records partnership. This year brings us another healthy dose of Almost, titled Monster Monster.The opening title track has the fun guitars and vocals found the last time around. Except this time there's something different--it all feels like more of a band effort. Not only are the vocals and lyrics extraordinary (something typical for a vocalist's side-project), but the music is as well! \"Monster Monster\" exhibits these elements perfectly. Repeating everything in the chorus twice gets monotonous, but it doesn't take away from the song in any way.One other thing that this first song demonstrates is the beginning of a concept album. The theme running through Monster Monster has to do with the dark side of our human nature. We all have a monster living in us that defies God's will for our lives and does what it wants for itself. But we can't let that monster win. Every day we have a choice to make: do we fight the monster or give in to its wicked desires? This is what Gillespie and crew structured Monster Monster around. In what may be the highlight of the album, he sings, \"When I am a monster, You never wince when You look at me. When I am a freak, You never stare. When I am a leper, You never say 'unclean.' And when I am lost... You come and get me free.\" God loves us even when we do give in to the monster, and is waiting to welcome us back into His arms when we realize our mistake.Other highlights of the album include the singles \"Lonely Wheel,\" a punk-rock track that sounds born to be played on the radio, and \"Hands,\" a song that not only has the catchiness and amazing lyrics to go with it, but the melodic piano fused throughout that gives The Almost a better chance to shine their musical talent. Without the piano in \"Hands,\" I'm not sure it would even be the same song.The diversity of Monster Monster is one of the things that makes it so enjoyable. From the punky, fun-loving mood of the opening four tracks, to the rougher and darker \"Young Again,\" to the ballad \"Summer Summer,\" all the way to the country tinge in \"Hand Grenade,\" we can see that the monster that The Almost has created is definitely a diverse one. The closing track, plainly titled \"Monster\"--set up to inevitably be confused with \"Monster Monster,\" the opening track--perhaps demonstrates the range and utter talent that this band is capable of the most. Starting off with just the acoustic guitar and Gillespie's voice sets the stage for something epic to unfold. Halfway through the song, it explodes with the rest of the band, with the main highlight being a guitar solo with a real blues feel. I wouldn't have been surprised if a harmonica had suddenly joined in. The band claims that the piece was recorded live, making an already epic track seem completely unbelievable.The amount of effort and genius put into this sophomore album is above and beyond what I had expected. It's rare to find a band with the incredible gift to make such great music and still choose to label themselves as \"Christian.\" Although the band isn't overly blunt about any of the Christian messages found throughout, their fame might cause some people to look into their background more, and hopefully through Tooth & Nail, discover God's love for them. I look forward to seeing what will happen with The Almost in the future with such a fantastic album. Best Christian rock album of 2009? We'll see...\n", "val": 0.020213542506098747}

But heaven help any girls who take this song's dreadful message to heart.In one of the most awkward love triangles since Twilight, meet the key players:YOU are the guy Orianthi is hung up on. You are a Grade A hole.I is for Orianthi, the gifted singer and guitar goddess who is most popular for standing next to famous people (Michael Jackson, Carrie Underwood, Alice Cooper).HIM is the guy who sees I for everything she is worth.According to YOU, I'm stupid, worthless, can't do anything right, a mess in a dress, boring, moody, can't get anywhere on time (since this last point isn't subjective and can be proved or disproved by fact, I, as in me not her, bet he, as in YOU, has her, Orianthi, pegged).According to HIM, I'm beautiful, incredible, funny, irresistible - so naturally WE (me and you, the reader of this essay, and YOU, the jerk she is hung up on since she just told him a verse ago) can deduct that I has no interest in dating HIM.Never once in this song do we hear what I thinks about herself. Never once does she utter the words, \"According to ME, I'm fabulous, smart, intelligent, well-read, talented...\"So the message is - Girls, your self-worth is totally defined by what men think about you. Good or bad.Nice message. Wait, it gets worse.Fine, I doesn't like HIM; he's probably a bit too clingy anyway. So what does she do? Hold her head high enough to find someone worthwhile of her companionship? No. Define herself on her own by not needing someone to complete her? No chance. I uses HIS opinion of her to beg YOU to come back.Kid you not, she says, \"Why can't YOU see me through HIS eyes? Why are you making me decide?\" Um, decide WHAT? Stay in an abusive relationship with YOU, the guy who I just told us that he just told you that \"he can't take you anyplace?\" YOU have moved on. I should too.To be fair, I didn't write this song, THEY (Steve Diamond and Andrew Frampton) did. Perhaps it would be best for Orianthi to speak for herself from now on.\n", "val": 0.0006257767672650516}

{"text": "I like to think of myself as an \"original\" Weird Al fan.  I was in middle school when his first albums were released and I've kept up with him since.  I also think he is one of the most under-appreciated artists of the last thirty years.  Not only are his lyrics clever and funny, but he (and his band) do spot-on covers of the tune and style of the artists being parodied.  That he can transition from Tony Basil to Nirvana to Coolio to Michael Jackson to Don McLean to James Brown to Queen (and so on) seemingly without missing a mark is astounding.The fact that he has outlasted many of the acts whom he has parodied is a testament to his genius.  Is this the \"perfect\" collection?  Probably not.  However, I do believe it more than lives up to the name \"essential\".  Just as an X-Men movie is going to leave out someone's favourite superhero, a two-disc set culled out of 12 studio albums is going to omit some fans' faves.  For me, these include \"Jerry Springer\", \"Midnight Star\", \"Trigger Happy\" and a handful of others.Although I imagine most hardcore Weird Al fans will have no use for this set to expand their collections, it is a good start point for casual fans or for someone who may not know who Weird Al is.\n", "val": 0.012085399590432644}
{"text": "I picked this up yesterday, not realizing it was the day the album was released.  I just saw Al on CD, and that caught my attention.  I'd always been a fan, but the only other album I own is Alapalooza on cassette.  So it seemed like a perfect excuse to expand my collection.Looking at the track list, it seemed like a truly complete and well-rounded Al compilation--all his greatest hits over his career.  The songs really are that good, and the track listing represents itself.  In fact, the only song I personally miss is \"Living in the Fridge\" (parody of Aerosmith's \"Living on the Edge\").So besides the songs, what else is there?  Well... there's a great essay by Steven Thomas of The Onion/AV Club, and there is a wealth of photos from over Al's 30 year career.  All of that adds to the overall value of the package for me.  It's also a really good way to introduce new and casual fans to more of Al's work.\n", "val": 0.028904199600219727}
{"text": "Weird Al Yankovic has had a very successful career poking fun at some of best-known songs in the music industry. Who could forget his parody of Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" or \"Beat It\". Personally, I really love the parody of The President's of the United States of America. \"Gump\" definitely has to be up there with some of the finest and well crafted songs he has ever performed.However, there are a few key tracks from this compilation that have gone MIA. How could this collection not include \"Headline News\". As any Yankovic knows, this was a parody from the Crash Test Dummies \"Mmm,Mmm,Mmm,Mmm\" hit. In all honesty, I like Weird Al's rendition of this song better than the original. Besides the song, the music video for \"Headline News\" is hysterical. To exclude this song from this collection is a travesty, and thus I have to knock a star off this review for this unbelievable omission. The omissions of \"Achy Breaky Song\" and \"Money For Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies\" also are unacceptable. I am not sure if Weird Al had a say-so in the song selection, but keeping these tracks, as well as some others really hurts the album's \"essential\" label.\n", "val": 3.9656002627452835e-05}

{"text": "After recently watching a special on VH-1 about the life and career of Weird Al Yankovic, I remembered how much I love the guy. Hes been recording musical spoofs for over 35 years now, and no one in music history, I think, has had such a long string of spot-on musical parodies. His latest album, Mandatory Fun, proves that hes still got it. (Word Crimes is an instant classic.)  This compilation, though, covers his career from his self-titled first album through 2006s Straight Outta Lynwood, and as a whole its an excellent collection, with about 2  hours of music. All but the first of those twelve albums is well-represented, from Another One Rides the Bus (the only song from his debut) through White and Nerdy.  Of course, since Weird Al is so prolific and so often on the mark, some of your personal favorites may not be here.  One of mine is Mr. Popeil (from the album In 3-D), a hilarious send-up of both the B-52s and those special TV offers.  Im not a fan of the two long tracks included here, Albuquerque and Trapped in the Drive-Thru, which together comprise about 22 minutes of the two-CD set.  I would rather have substituted five or six shorter classics like My Bologna, I Love Rocky Road, Ricky (all from the first album), I Want a New Duck, Addicted to Spuds, Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies, Living in the Fridge, or Christmas at Ground Zero,  a Phil-Spectoresque style parody which I think is superior to The Night Santa Went Crazy. So to remedy that, in addition to downloading this collection, I cherry-picked another CDs worth of favorites that weren't included. Now Im bopping to over 3  hours of Weird Al and loving just about every minute of it.\n", "val": 0.006531128194183111}

{"text": "Admittedly in this age of Media Player and other software where you can make your own \"Weird Al\" greatest hits CDs for your car or wherever you don't want to take you expensive to replace original albums, when this latest compilation was released, I paid it virtually no attention.  It was only when I was in the music store buying a copy of Al's latest album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Alpocalypse/dp/B004Y9CREK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Alpocalypse</a>&nbsp;that I thought I'd pick up and read the back of Essential just to read which songs were on it.  That's when I noticed something this site and other websites never mentioned, The Night Santa Went Crazy has in brackets after it (extra gory version).  I've got to have that, I thought. So grabbed a copy of this double CD as well as Alpocalypse.  Must admit that upon my first listen of the extra gory version of The Night Santa Went Crazy I was getting a bit annoyed, thinking they'd put the exact same version I already had as it's not until the near the end part between Yes Virginia and they say Mrs Claus is on the phone every night, that we have any alternative lyrics from the Bad Hair Day album version. In the original version Santa is in jail for 700 years, surviving reindeer are in therapy and the elves now have to work for the postal service, in this new version Al kills off Santa.Those new lyrics are  -\"Yes Virginia, now Santa Claus is dead,some guy from the S.W.A.T. team blew a hole through his head.Yes little friend now as his brain's on the floor,guess they won't have the fat guy to kick around anymore,but now there's no more presents, for children's enjoyment,and the elves `gota' stand in line to file for unemployment,\"I've heard Al sing those lyrics before at a live concert but it's good to be able to get them on CD. I must admit I had expected the whole song to have alternative lyrics throughout it, maybe with new ways to kill the reindeer, but what's there  still makes Essential a worthwhile purchase.And Essential in its own right isn't a bad compilation album and would make a nice gift for the friend who has always admired your \"Weird Al\" collection but never bought their own. All the major parody songs those who don't have the other albums know ie Eat It, Fat, Smells Like Nirvana, Like a Surgeon are all here.  As are his iconic original songs with the biggest cult followings You Don't Love Me Anymore (the only original to be released as single), The Biggest Ball of Twine of in Minnesota, Melanie, Dare to Be Stupid, Your Horoscope for Today and Albuquerque.  Sure maybe mine or your favourites aren't all here, or you would have included different songs instead, I for example would have said Constipated, Isle Thing, I Love Rocky Road, Headline News, Spam and other parodies are better than some on here instead of what Al did, (yes Al selected the ones on here, they aren't supposed to be his greatest hits, but instead the songs that represented his career during each album).  Likewise with original songs Do I Creep You Out, Party at the Leper Colony and others could be argued for but the point is you never come across an album by any artist made up of songs from their original albums where the line up is exactly what you the customer would have made.  Luckily we have the software and technology that if we own the original albums we can simply make up our own greatest hits album.  This album is pretty much aimed at people who don't own those albums and I think what's on here will more than please those people, as well as inspire them to get the original albums down the track.This album comes with a nice little CD insert, it disappointingly doesn't have the lyrics for each song but does give basic info on each, such as which album it's from and when it was recorded, if it's a parody the name of the original artist and song, and stuff like this.  There's some nice photo imagery in the booklet too, spanning Al's long career, including a double page spread of all the album and a few singles covers as well.  There's live concert photos, film clip still photos, stills from the movie UHF and lots of interesting pictures to look at.  Some fans may even see buying this album for the CD insert booklet alone as making this a must purchase addition to their collection.I do think it's a shame that apart from the extra gory version of Santa Went Crazy, there's no other new music on here. If we're adding lyrics from concerts to the original songs why not add the Yoda chant to Yoda? Plus surely You're Pitiful (parody of Blunt's You're Beautiful), could have been included since it never appeared on any other album, only as a free download.Still it's a brilliant compilation, and a must own if you don't have the money to get all the original albums if you're a kid who wasn't alive when they came out, have been released from prison after decades behind bars or for whatever reason never bought the original albums when they first came out.\n", "val": 3.0346882340381853e-05}

{"text": "I ordered this collection earlier in the year (I think that's when it was) because it had several songs that I didn't have and hadn't heard, in addition to several of my favorite ones. Well, turns out that it isn't that great after all. I may be in the minority, I don't know, but I'm rather disappointed with this \"essential\" collection.The second CD suffers most. There are way too many songs on it that I really wouldn't have missed if they had been left off. These include most of the really long songs (\"Albuquerque,\" \"Trapped In The Drive-Thru\"), \"Hardware Store,\" \"Since You've Been Gone,\" \"Gump,\" and several others. There are better songs that could have been included instead. In fact, if you took off \"Albuquerque\" and \"Trapped In The Drive-Thru,\" you could replace each of them with two songs, at least.The first CD (featuring material from his early-80s-to-early-90s period) is a lot better, but it also has its flaws. For example, I would have preferred \"Addicted To Spuds\" to \"Dog Eat Dog,\" and \"Biggest Ball Of Twine In Minnesota\" is good, but I wouldn't have complained if \"Christmas At Ground Zero\" and \"Achy Breaky Song\" had been on the CD instead. In fact, I don't really see how anyone could leave those two songs off of a Weird Al \"essential\" collection.If it's true that Al himself compiled this collection, he could have done a lot better. Heck, anybody could have. I know that there are people who won't agree with my views here, and I have to admit that there is some good to be found on these CDs (most of it on the first), but overall, this \"essential\" collection leaves me kind of cold; it barely avoids getting just two stars from me.(By the way, is it just me, or does Al look even dorkier without the mustache and glasses than he did with them?)\n", "val": 2.9152099159546196e-05}

{"text": "Confession: I have all the original CDs. In fact, I started buying Al-bums when they were vinyl, Al's first few records came out before CDs were generally available, I had to buy the CD versions later.  Like when the Beatles remasters came out recently, true fans will listen extremely closely to both old and new versions.  Is Jim's guitar a little stronger here?  What about the detail in Bermuda's drumming?  Changes that seem too subtle to notice are really important to us Al-aholics.  I wouldn't take a chance on the digital downloads, some detail could be lost in the conversion to MP3.  As a fan who already has all the CDs (along with Jim's and Steve's solo ventures), I have an answer to those who argue about which songs were selected as essential, and which were left out:  Buy them all, including this compilation.  Then dare to compare, sort of like wondering whether Disneyland or Disney World has the best \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" -- not to mention the foreign versions (of either the Disney rides or Al's songs) -- will Al release the exact same versions in Australia, or should I also buy these releases as well?  Maybe this is a bit extreme, but as I line up my trips to Disney parks in France, Japan and China, \"Jurassic Park\" plays in the background.  I hope I can take in one of Al's Costa Mesa shows on my way to Tokyo Disneyland.\n", "val": 0.00017777453467715532}

{"text": "Multiple Grammy award winning artist Weird Al Yankovic is the premier musical satirist and parodist ever, and these remastered 38 songs and 24 page booklet testify to his genius. He began to the casual fan as simply a Michael Jackson parodist, but his creativity and popularity have continued to increase as many of the artists he's spoofed have vanished. Al's most recent material, Straight Outta Lynwood and \"White and Nerdy\" have been his most popular.  Since his Greatest Hits 2 stretches back to 1994, it was time for a retrospective on Weird Al's comprehensive body of work.Any fan could choose some different or additional songs to include in this collection, but I'll defer to Weird Al's selections.  \"King of Suede\" was great, as were \"A Complicated Song,\" and \"Pretty Fly for a Rabbi,\" but nearly all of Al's material is worthy of inclusion. I could, however, deduct  star  for \"Trapped in the Drive-Thru.\" It represents a new trend of one very long song per album, and I find that they're really only funny once.If \"Dare to be Stupid\" is a philosophy, then Al's certainly hit upon the winning formula. He's a twisted genius in a nice guy sort-of-way.  (Remember the Coolio controversy.) I've been a fan since Al's beginning; I remember hearing \"My Bologna\" on the Dr. Demento show, and I've loved all of his work ever since. Here's a testament to Weird Al's influence: \"It was so big overseas that people were telling me they had heard my version of Weird Al's song (White & Nerdy). - Chamillionaire, 2007.

{"text": "To begin with, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic -- who just turned 50 last year -- is someone I always forget how much I've liked until I happen to hear a new song from him. I heard the Michael Jackson parody \"Eat It\" sometime in the 1980s when I was very young, and I thought it was a hoot; after that, listening to The Dr. Demento Show in the early '90s, I was introduced to songs like \"Fat,\" \"Smells Like Nirvana\" (my personal fave), the Beach Boys pastiche \"Trigger Happy,\" and \"You Don't Love Me Anymore.\" A few years later, the Coolio parody \"Amish Paradise\" came along, and in 1999 I caught \"The Saga Begins\" (the plot of Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace set to the tune of \"American Pie\") and VH1's cheeky Behind The Music special. Then \"White & Nerdy\" and the hysterical charity-single goof \"Don't Download This Song\" caught my attention in 2006. All of the aforementioned tracks are included in this 2-disc, 38-track Essential collection -- indeed, it's the Weird Al retrospective I've been waiting for.Al's first 8 albums (from 1983 to 1993) have been anthologized many times before -- on two volumes of Greatest Hits, the box set Permanent Record, The Food Album, The TV Album -- and now they're revisited on Disc 1 of this set. But this set is the first time his 4 albums from 1996 to 2006 have received the best-of treatment; this period is covered on Disc 2. Given that the tracks on Essential were picked by the man himself -- including a mix of hits, his personal favorites, and fan faves -- I can't really argue with what he apparently feels is his best and most enduring work. Anyway, this was meant as an introduction for beginning fans, and besides, any compilation NOT specifically based on which songs were released as singles and/or how high they charted is bound to come up short for longtime fans. (For the record, from what little I've heard on the radio, I'm already missing \"Stop Draggin' My Car Around,\" \"Christmas At Ground Zero,\" \"When I Was Your Age,\" \"Couch Potato,\" and \"Ode To A Superhero.\")Frankly, I'd rather address what actually IS here. Though Weird Al is most widely known for his parodies of Top 40 pop hits (\"Like A Surgeon,\" \"eBay\") and rock classics (\"Yoda,\" \"Jurassic Park\"), his original tunes are often equally accomplished -- from twisted love songs like the nasty heartbreak ballad \"One More Minute,\" the power pop-y \"Melanie\" and the doo-wop ditty \"Since You've Been Gone,\" to the off-the-wall narratives of \"The Biggest Ball Of Twine In Minnesota\" and \"Albuquerque,\" to the remarkable rapid-fire sections of \"Your Horoscope For Today\" and \"Hardware Store.\" Furthermore, he and his longtime bandmates -- drummer Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz, bassist Steve Jay, and guitarist Jim West -- prove themselves incredibly versatile performers, moving deftly from polka (the covers medley \"Polkas On 45\") to New Wave (\"Dare To Be Stupid\" and \"Dog Eat Dog,\" dead-on \"style parodies\" of Devo and the Talking Heads, respectively) to rap and R&B (\"It's All About The Pentiums,\" \"Trapped In The Drive-Thru\") to symphonic pop (the Brian Wilson homage \"Pancreas\"). Regardless of whether or not you think Al's lyrical jokes hold up, you really can't deny the sheer craftsmanship that went into the music.Weird Al's career has lasted a good 30 years (which is as long as I've been *alive*), outlasting the careers of most of the artists he's parodied. Early on, after his accordion-driven self-titled 1983 debut (represented here only by \"Another One Rides The Bus,\" an acoustic single he had actually recorded in 1980), he and his band realized the best jokes are told with a straight face rather than with a giggle; throughout this set's 2-and-a-half+ hours, you can follow the band's musical growth, as well as Al's knack for keeping up with current trends without altering himself in any fundamental sense (i.e. occasional mild vulgarity and gross-out humor aside, his lyrics are intended for a general audience, and have never resorted to outright profanity). Not that Al shows any signs of slowing down, either: He is currently working on a new album -- five of the tracks having already been previewed on last year's digital EP Internet Leaks -- and I am most certainly looking forward to whatever he does next.\n", "val": 6.710224988637492e-05}

{"text": "I've been a Weird Al fan since the mid 80's and as such enjoy his old stuff quite a bit more.  Not to say the newer material isn't good, but it's just not the classic Weird Al I remember.  Saying that, I'm a bit disappointed in the focus on the newer material and ignoring some great older songs.  Here's a breakdown of the albums and some thoughts on songs I wish would have been included or removed.- \"Weird Al\" Yankovic: Included - Another one Rides the Bus; Notable Omissions - My Bologna, I Love Rocky Road, The Check's in the Mail.  I really don't understand the inclusion of only one song from the album that started it all.- In 3-D: 3 - Polkas on 45; Eat It; I Lost on Jeopardy; Notable Omissions - King of Suede and Theme from Rocky XIII.  This is my favorite Al album so I'm disappointed in the selection from this album.  While Eat It is a must, and one polka needs to be included so 45 is a pretty good selection, the inclusion of Jeopardy is disappointing since that is my least favorite song from the album.  I was truly shocked to see that neither King of Suede of Theme from Rocky XIII wasn't included - especially considering they are parodies of major hit songs.  I'd also prefer Nature Trail to Hell or Mr. Popeil over Jeopardy.- Dare to be Stupid: Yoda; One More Minute; Like a Surgeon; Dare to be Stupid; Notable Omissions - None.  I could have lived without the inclusion of Like a Surgeon - especially considering other songs not included from albums.- Polka Party!: Dog Eat Dog; Notable Omissions - Living With a Hernia; Here's Johnny; Christmas at Ground Zero; Good Enough for Now.  This is one of my favorite albums.  Dog Eat Dog is one of my favorite songs.  I would have sacrificed Yoda from Date to be Stupid to include one of those song's mentioned.- Even Worse: Lasagna; Melanie; Fat; Notable Omissions - This Song's Just Six Words Long, Good 'Ol Days, Stuck in a Closet With Vanna White.  There are so many good songs on this album.  I would have rather had either of those three over Lasagna.  Melanie and Fat are musts.- UHF: UHF; Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota; Notable Omissions - Beverly Hillbillies, Spam.  Hillbillies definitely should have been included over the UHF title track.  Twine is a high point.- Off the Deep End: Trigger Happy; Smells Like Nirvana; You Don't Love Me Anymore; Notable Omissions - None.  I would have only selected Smells Like Nirvana from this album, and I don't even care for that song very much.  Many of the earlier songs indicated are better choices- Alapalooza: Bedrock Anthem; Frank's 2000\" TV; Jurassic Park; Notable Omissions - I would have replaced Bedrock Anthem with Living in the Fridge.  Bohemian Polka would have also been a good addition.- Bad Hair Day: Since You've Been Gone; Amish Paradise; Gump; Everything You Know is Wrong; The Night Santa Went Crazy; Notable Omissions - I Remember Larry.  Too many songs and not the correct ones.  Amish Paradise and Gump for sure, but there are so many better earlier songs that could have been included over some of these.  Also, Headline News - not on this album but on a compilation album released between the previous two albums is perhaps the most glaring omission of all.  Christmas at Ground Zero from Polka Party! is a far superior twist Christmas Song- Running With Scissors: Your Horoscope for Today; It's All About the Pentiums; The Saga Begins; Albuquerque; Notable Omissions - None.  All songs are fine - especially the Saga and Albuquerque - but again, more songs than I think the album deserves.- Poodle Hat - eBay; Bob; Hardware Store; Notable Omissions - None.  Only eBay should have been included from this album.  Hardware store is not as good as You Make Me from Even Worse - both fast paced, frantic songs.- Straight Outta Lynwood: I'll Sue Ya; Canadian Idiot; Pancreas; Don't Download This Song; White & Nerdy; Trapped in the Drivethru; Notable Omissions - None.  But 6 songs?12 albums condensed to 38 songs and 13 of those come from the last 3.  That leaves only 25 songs from the first 9 - less than 3 songs each.  I think the selection could have been better and therefore I cannot give this 5 stars.  I think you can get a great example of Al's career in a selection of 38 songs - I just don't think that this was the best 38.\n", "val": 2.8883778213639744e-05}

It's amazing that he has managed to stay on top of his game for so many years.  His most recent material ranks right up there with his great 80's material.  \"Trapped in the Drive Thru\" and \"Ebay\" are as good as anything he's ever done.Since pretty much all of his hits have been song parodies, I wasn't aware of how many great originals he had done.  Some, such as \"One More Minute\", don't really sound like anybody else, but there are several original songs here that sound exactly like a certain artist, but they're not parodies of a particular song.  For example:\"Dare To Be Stupid\" sounds exactly like Devo.\"Trigger Happy\" and \"Pancreas\" sound exactly like the Beach Boys.\"Dog Eat Dog\" sounds exactly like Talking Heads.\"Bob\" sounds exactly like mid-Sixties Dylan, with the added bonus that every line is a palindrome!And his great song parodies are pure genius.  I especially love \"Bedrock Anthem\", \"The Saga Begins\", \"Ebay\", \"Trapped in the Drive Thru\", \"Amish Paradise\", \"Smells Like Nirvana\", \"I Lost on Jeopardy\", and my all-time favorite Weird Al song, \"Like A Surgeon.\"This is a great collection.  There's nobody else like Weird Al.  Some artists have succeeded with the occasional funny song.  Bloodhound Gang has had a few great songs, but they're not in the same league.  Nobody else in my lifetime has had such a long, brilliant career doing comedy songs.  As the liner notes quite seriously state, Weird Al Yankovic absolutely belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n", "val": 0.025850802659988403}

There is a great selection of songs on here. Of course it covers all the major singles like Eat it,Like a Surgeon,Amish Paradise,White and Nerdy,and the very old, Another One Rides the Bus. This song, going by his behind the music, was originally recorded in a bathroom in his college. I saw another reviewer bring up the exclusion of Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies. This does suck because otherwise you'd have to get it on the UHF album. This album had very few highlights and is only really good if you a big fan of the UHF movie. Which you should be because that movie was awesome and would have been a big hit if Indy Jones hadn't also come out. But that's just my opinion.

{"text": "Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova return with The Swell Season 2.0 and there's no let down. At first listen, there's nothing as instantly catchy as the tunes from \"Once\" and their debut album. If you consider the fact that the tunes from those albums represent some of the finest highlights of Glen Hansard's career with The Frames, it's completely understandable. Even if their romantic relationship didn't survive staring at fame in the face, their creative muse did. They seem to have drawn on the end of their romance and the beginning of a different kind of friendship to craft the gentle sadness and cautious optimism that runs through this album. The lion's share of the credit still goes to Hansard but he makes good use of Irglova who's a stellar musician still developing her skills as a vocalist and songwriter. If you consider her age, she should be absolutely devastating as she gains experience. That doesn't even take into account that she was born to harmonize with Glen. Their voices were absolutely made for each other. Grab the deluxe edition and you've got a full length concert and dvd where Glen's skills as a front man are absolutely dazzling.

Now they follow up that success with a new album under their collective name, The Swell Season.  It's a more polished affair than either their debut album or the \"Once\" soundtrack, but it's also much more cohesive.  You won't hear Hansard's raw, shouting vocals that punctuated the songs from \"Once\", but that's not a problem.  This is definitely a mellower affair, and the songwriting is every bit as strong and more mature.

{"text": "I picked up the new The Swell Season CD today, called  Strict Joy. I got the deluxe edition, which has a second CD of live tracks from the last couple of tours. A total of 32 tracks - 13 make up the new CD and 19 are live tracks.A quick glance at the writing credits of the new songs betrays that this is more of a Glen Hansard album. Marketa Irgolva only has a couple of writing credits. But her voice and piano are very present, and the harmonies are still sweet.The album opens with a couple of good, solid upbeat tunes (Low Rising and Feeling the Pull). Not until the third song (In These Arms) do we get a song that sounds like the Once soundtrack, with Irglova harmonizing with Hansard over soft acoustic progressions. These three songs were released over the last couple of months as singles on iTunes but this is the first time I had heard any of them.The fourth song, The Rain, comes back up in tempo with full band and impassioned relationship-based lyrics from Hansard.In fact, relationships seem to be the theme of this album and there doesn't seem to be any effort to hide the fact that it's a very Fleetwood Mac-ish break-up album. The songs are loaded with references to the on-again off-again nature of Irglova and Hansard's relationship. Lots of songs about longing, people.But where the Once soundtrack and  The Swell Season CD are mostly softer, acoustic based discs with a couple of rockers, Strict Joy is a better balance.Not knowing anything at all about these two (except for the movie) when I saw them the first time live, they were mostly acoustic and quiet, which is what I kind of expected. The second time through, however, Hansard had most of his band The Frames with him, and they did lots of really upbeat, rocking numbers. Some of The Frames tunes like Fitzcarraldo were fairly face-melting. That rocking side of the band comes through more on this disc.A good example is High Horses, which starts out as an arpeggiated, repeating piano riff but really takes off at the end with full band coming in and bringing the energy level waaaaay up. This one will be on par with Fitzcarraldo live. The Verb does something similar structurally, with some very nice call and response vocal trade offs and a great build at the end with a nice use of strings.Irglova's two songs are strong. Fantasy Man is pretty obviously about Hansard and is well done, with dare I say an Eastern European vibe to it (it would make sense, since that is where she is from). I Have Loved You Wrong is the standout here. I remember seeing this one live and thinking, what the hell is this song? It's a very trancy song, with a repeating bass line and very tasty piano noodlings. But the repeating vocal bit that takes the song out was mind blowing live, and although it is understated on this version, the song is done really well on this disc. Might be her best song.Suffice it to say, if you like the music from the movie Once, and/or the first Swell Season album, you'll love this. And if you dig The Frames, you'll probably like it too. I am still discovering that band, so I don't have a ton of insight there. But the new material picks up where the last left off, with enough familiarity to link it to the previous work but also with enough of an evolution so that you don't feel like you are listening to a re-hash.There really isn't a bad track on the CD although the last two songs are a bit sleepy, although very pretty - especially the outro to Somebody Good, which closes the CD with some gorgeous vocal harmonies between Hansard and Irglova. A nice way to wrap up the CD.And of course you get what amounts to a full live CD as a bonus of you get the deluxe edition. Which is nice.I reviewed the CD and the last couple of Portland-area live performances on my blog at [...]. Check it out!\n", "val": 0.009077792055904865}

Some I really liked, like Low Rising, but some of the songs leave me a little blah. But if you like the Swell Season you will enjoy the CD.Now the Live CD is AMAZING. Great playing, great sound mixing, and GREAT performances. They all just play together so well and they do a wide variety of songs of mostly their more well known stuff (not a negative for me).

In some places the cameras struggle with the lighting, the deep blues and purples for instance can look a bit pixelated. But the performance will keep you from caring much about it. High points for me are Marketa's solo version of All the Way Down, the simplicity of I Have Loved You Wrong, and 'Once'.

Highly recommended.\n", "val": 0.052896007895469666}
{"text": "We live in a veritable golden age of independent and folk musical artistry.  From The Avett Brothers to Derek Webb to The Decemberists to Damien Rice to Colm Mac Con Iomaire to Iron & Wine (a few of my favorites from America and Ireland), the folk indie music scene is absolutely brilliant.  Within this genre perhaps no artists write more heart-wrenchingly beautiful and emotionally raw music than the dynamic duo of Glenn Hansard and Markta Irglov, also known as The Swell SeasonTo most readers, Hansard and Irglov will be best known and recognized as the stars of the wonderful modern musical, \"Once\".  Filmed in Dublin over two and a half weeks at 130,000, \"Once\" is a beautifully executed story of love and friendship as expressed by the genuine, heart-felt music of The Swell Season.  As a coming-out for Hansard and Iglov (although it must be said that Hansard had previously been in the entertaining Irish film \"The Commitments\" and has been performing as front-man for the Irish band The Frames for year) \"Once\" showed the kind of magic that can happen when two artists who were made for each other join forces to create something truly special.It is obvious that Hansard and Irglov are at their artistic best when corroborating together.  Their voices meld together in exquisite harmony in a fashion that is absolutely breath taking.  Their chemistry is un-matched.  They truly are each other's muse.  It is precisely this chemistry (and emotional honesty for that matter) that is the true genius of \"Once\".  The movie and the music is real, it is genuine and it is understandable and relatable.  Watching \"Once\" is to forget that one is watching a movie.  The viewer joins into the story with the characters, feeling what they feel and experiencing what they experience.This honesty and chemistry is the same strength of \"Strict Joy\".  A story of hurt, heartache and subdued joy, \"Strict Joy\" is beautifully written and performed.  Communicating the many-faceted feelings of a relationship broken and bruised (but not completely finished), \"Strict Joy\" provides the listener with songs of hope (\"Low Rising\"), repentance (\"I Have Loved You Wrong\") and sorrowful frustration (\"Two Tongues\"), the album runs the gamut of experience and emotion.Far from the raw, emotive energy of \"Once\" (most notably in the songs \"When Your Mind's Made Up\" and \"Lies\"), \"Strict Joy\" employs a more refined, mature and consistent introspection (ala \"Falling Slowly\").  Much of this musical maturation seems to be ground in the growing integration and skills of Irglov, specifically in the songs she writes and performs with Hansard.  As for Hansard, he is as good in this album as he is with anything he writes.  His transparent song crafting is infectious and his energy is revitalizing.  He is one of the most gifted and experience songwriters in the indie music scene.  Add the growing skills of Irglov and it is hard to imagine much of a creative limit for the duo.The album's best moment is found in the song \"I Have Loved You Wrong\".  Hopefully haunting, the song expresses a surprising sorrow for wrongs committed and a deep and abiding desire for reconciliation.  Similar in tone and sound to the achingly lovely \"The Hill\" from \"Once\", \"I Have Loved You Wrong\" is Irglov at her best.  The addition of Hansard's harmony at the close of the song is absolute dynamite and demonstrates just how perfectly their voices are suited for each other.While not as strong or approachable as the soundtrack for \"Once\", \"Strict Joy\" is still a stellar effort by The Swell Season and a worthy addition to any music lover's library.\n", "val": 0.028542565181851387}

{"text": "In honesty, I loved the film \"Once\", but the soundtrack itself overall left me a little...ambivalent.  I adored a couple of the songs from the film, but others were less compelling.  Subsequent tracks put out by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova under the band name \"The Swell Season\" were equally touch-and-go for me.  There was obvious talent and emotion, but only a few of their songs really resonated with me, or somehow, the arrangements seemed to fall short of the musicians' talents.  However, when I heard a preview of the upcoming \"Strict Joy\", I was absolutely captivated from the start.  There is a maturity and professionalism that has come to touch upon The Swell Season on this album, which I find both compelling, soothing and with each progressive listen, more addictive.  The album as a whole has grown on me, like a familiar pair of soft, old, comfortable shoes.  The nuances in production value as well as mostly subtle tempo changes from song to song are endearing, pleasant, easy on the ears, nicely put next to each other.  But the songwriting itself is the real treasure, here.  The raw, unabashed truthfulness in each track wreaks of frailty, longing, failure, tenderness, and even through heartbreak, ultimate joy.  Not that it should matter, but Hansard's and Irglova's well publicized romance and subsequent breakup (despite their admirable staying together in a professional partnership) makes each song all the more powerful, raw and almost uncomfortable in their intimacy, offering a voyeuristic view into the very private details and unraveling of their romance.  But in truth, there is power.  The truthfulness and sensitivity of this album really strikes a chord, offering a glimpse of real struggle, despair and ultimately, growth.  Although there are no clunkers on this album, the tracks that struck me from the start were \"Low Rising\", \"In these Arms\", \"High Horses\" and \"I Have Loved You Wrong\".This album is beautiful, raw, emotive and so far, my favorite for all of 2009.\n", "val": 0.014515313319861889}
{"text": "Like so many others, I became a big fan of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova via the Once film and soundtrack. Their follow-up effort again has moments of transcendent harmonic elegance, along with some excellent compositions. If there is a weakness it is that some tunes come off as being really good ideas for songs rather than being fully realized compositions - two verses, two choruses and maybe a brief solo to pad it a bit. (I love the Kate Bush-esque outro on High Horses.)However, there isn't a track here that is without some moment of magic that make these two such a potent musical force. The whole CD exudes \"heart\", from the vulnerability of Marketa's lead vocals to the honesty of Glen's alternatively hushed confessional or busking bravado delivery. There are a few musical derivatives of the earlier work - Love That Conquers' 5/4 meter is a little more laid-back, but still reminiscent of If Your Mind's Made Up; Two Tongues has the electronica percussion of If You Want Me; Marketa's I Have Loved You Wrong recalls the The Hill, and so forth - but then again, with musical landmarks so pleasant, one doesn't mind passing by them again, and the results are far from stale repetition.Finally, I would note that the deluxe version (w/ live CD and DVD documentary) is a great value and really further draws fans in to appreciate the humanity of these two performers.

I'd read in an interview that Glen and Marketa had ended the romantic aspect of their relationship (I can't imagine how intense it must be to collaborate in such a creative and beautiful way), but the songs on this record aren't bitter, awkward, or phoned-in.

{"text": "Strict Joy is an achievement. It chronicles every feeling of falling out of love; unexpected loneliness, second guessing yourself, blindly thinking you still have a chance, guilt, questioning life, wondering why it all had to happen, and at the end, acceptance, however bittersweet it may be. The music never condescends the listener with any sappy breakup songs that scream \"poor me\". It's more of an audio diary of the decline of the real relationship of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, and if any musicians these days know about catharsis, it's these guys. It also doesn't hurt that they're two of the best musicians working today, and they are a revelation when put together. As if they're already great enough when they're each on their own, there's nothing better than hearing these two harmonize.The album begins with the sweeping, charming Low Rising, which I've loved to death since they performed it on the Tonight Show however many months ago. I have to say I like most live versions of this better than this studio version (partly because of the mix) but that doesn't change how good of a song it really is. Then the album has a two-song slump, which is the only low point of the whole album. No matter how many times I've tried to like Feeling the Pull, I just cannot. And In These Arms is better, but I really can't find anything to it; it just feels standard to me. But after this slump comes one of the best parts of the record, tracks 4-6. I can't explain how much I love all 3 of these songs. They of course all contribute to the scope of the full album, but if they were released on their own as an EP, it'd be one of my favorite EPs released by any band. High Horses isn't necessarily one of the best on the record, but it's a good song nontheless. After that, every track (and I mean every track) is golden, with the exhilirating The Verb being one of the very high points of the record (which actually isn't saying much, because nearly every song here is a high point of the record). Back Broke closes the album in a desperate, sad, and very real fashion, and if someone told me this was exactly how the couple ended their relationship, I wouldn't doubt them.Buy Strict Joy. I might've given you some of the best advice you've heard in a while. This is worth your money, and much more. It's one of the most satisfying listening experiences I've had all year. If you like the music from Once, then I hope you'll like this; though keep in mind, those songs were about falling in love, and these songs are about falling out of it.\n", "val": 0.006321493070572615}
{"text": "Like many people, I was first introduced to Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova when I went to see the movie \"Once.\"  Of course I was swept away by that charming film, and since music was so integral to its appeal, buying the soundtrack was a no-brainer.  Yet my love for the movie did not quite translate to the soundtrack which (though not bad by any means) has not earned anything close to heavy rotation at home or in the car.So it was only natural that the new album by The Swell Season (Hansard and Irglova), \"Strict Joy,\" would end up in my hands too.  And I have listened to this album almost nonstop since I first gave it a spin about a week ago.  The difference, I think, is one of scale and scope.  Although I love the music from \"Once,\" I have a somewhat limited appetite for spare, singer-songwriter music without any significant backing instrumentation.  All of the music from the \"Once\" soundtrack was beautiful in and of the moment, but not addictive in the same way that a really great album can be.\"Strict Joy\" is that kind of great album.  The cohesive feel of the songs is immediately apparent, yet the album is not repetitive or tedious in any way.  It's true that heartache is the subject matter throughout, yet the songs are so fresh and beautiful that I am never left feeling that I've heard it all before.The first two songs couldn't seem more different.  \"Low Rising\" plods along languidly, perfect for a slow dance or a slow drink at the bar.  The song is guided by a growling Hansard, and a mournful, bluesy electric guitar solo.  \"Feeling the Pull,\" at the opposite end, is a jangly, twinkling folk song, full of wanderlust and melancholy.The remainder of \"Strict Joy\" charts the territory in between these polarities, such as the sweet darkness of \"In These Arms,\" \"Paper Cup,\" and \"Back Broke,\" and the innocent sadness of \"Fantasy Man\" and \"I Have Loved You Wrong.\"  Yet the best songs may be \"The Rain,\" which starts off with just Hansard and an acoustic guitar, but escalates to a soaring, full-band sound with guitars, strings and a xylophone, and \"High Horses,\" a moody, fast-paced number reminiscent of Death Cab for Cutie at their best and REM's \"Losing My Religion.\"  \"Strict Joy\" is great throughout, but these are the album's real high points.\n", "val": 0.011711878702044487}

{"text": "I first heard of Swell Season three years ago when I went to a Damien Rice concert. Swell Season was the opening act and I had never heard of them. I was blown away. Glen Hansard is a fantastic singer and a masterful storyteller during his live shows. That night, I bought their first CD. I was impressed with nearly every track and I went out and bought a CD from Hansard's other band, The Frames.Then a few months later, I saw that Hansard and Marketa were appearing in a film together called Once, which features  a great deal of music from that Swell Season CD. I was overjoyed to see the band would then go on to win an Oscar.So is there a sophomore slump or hangover with Strict Joy, the duo's second CD? Not at all. It is excellent. Every track is great and I was impressed that most of the music is softer than what Hansard has done with The Frames. It's a different side to him that should be explored more, I think, in future projects. As for Marketa, she is great but I prefer listening to his voice.

{"text": "I've been listening to \"Strict Joy\" continuously for the past week and find more to like about it every time.  The genius lies in the poetry of the words, the emotion in the music, the raw feeling in the \"story of two lovers who danced both edges of the knife\".  I know that artists of any kind find more inspiration when their own emotions are intense--such as those of falling in and out of love.  Glen and Marketa have harnessed their emotions and channeled them into an album full of beautiful, bittersweet music.  Marketa's voice is never more beautiful than when she sings \"Fantasy Man\" and \"I Have Loved You Wrong\".  And what a way to end the latter song with the repitition of the same phrase \"on my mind\" over and over.  Isn't that the way of love--not being able to get your lover (or former lover) out of your mind?  Glen's voice is for the most part quieter and more gentle than in some of his previous songs.  I think that \"Back Broke\" is one of the best songs on the album.  The sadness, the hope, the acceptance  are all tempered by the plaintive, heartbreaking melody of the violin as it brings the song and the album to an end. The lush background music and their combined voices on most of the songs show us that despite the failure of their romance, they still can make beautiful music together.This is quickly becoming my favorite album even though I loved \"Once\" and the \"Swell Season\" albums.  It will captivate you too from the first song until the last note.\n", "val": 0.034622617065906525}
{"text": "Being a huge Frames/Swell Season fan, I've been anticipating this album for a long while now. I can say with a sigh of relief that I'm not disappointed. I really really enjoy \"Strict Joy\". I'd heard a lot of the songs live, and of course they are better than the studio versions, but it's not really fair to compare.That being said, here is what I thought:Low Rising - This is a very strong opening number. People say that it's really Van Morrisonesque, and I suppose that I'd agree with that. Glen's voice on this track is great, and it's got a great hook. My only problem with the song, is the production. I feel like it's been bogged down with too much drone. I think that the song would be better without the brass, and with more guitar. Still, a solid and catchy opening number. 8.5/10Feeling The Pull - This is a great song. Very folky, with an old time optimistic feel. It's catchy, nicely written, and also it's very short and sweet. It retains the energy of Low Rising and focuses it in a very different way. I do however, miss the moments when played live Glen goes into a nice falsetto and lightly strums the guitar. However, the song is still great without it, and doesn't really suffer without it's inclusion. 8.5/10In These Arms - Beautiful song, with beautiful lyrics. Glen's vocals are hushed, which makes the song sound almost like a lullaby. The harmonies and piano bits provided by Marketa are gorgeous. The songs beauty is in its simplicity. It's very clean, dark, and yet hopeful at the same time. Fantastic tune. 9/10The Rain - This song to me, is very Frames reminiscent. It's dark, drum driven, has a prevalent bass part, and it makes nice use of the violin. It's a bit repetitive, but the song itself isn't that long, so you don't get a sense of a one minute song left on repeat. It's a nice tune, not one of the standouts, but by no means bad. 7/10Fantasy Man - This is a Marketa driven song, and it's great. It has an old medieval feel to it, and almost seems like it is a cover song from the olden days. The harmonies are fantastic, and really shows how wonderfully Glen and Marketa can blend their voices. Glen's part is very soft and understated, yet works extremely well. This song really shows off Marketa's talent. Her voice is like a warm fire on a cold rainy day. Very nice, soft, and welcoming. 9.5/10Paper Cup - This song has very nice lyrics, and an almost Spanish-like feel to it, which is provided by the lead guitar. It's a soft song, and the lyrics while a tad bit sappy, work well and in no way sound cliched. It's a nice tune with a nice appeasing melody. 8/10High Horses - The is by far the heaviest song on the album. It's a great throwback to The Frames, and sounds like it could have been off of one of their albums. The song becomes eerily quiet about 3/4 in, and then builds from there into a nice rocking ending. The effect is very nice, and it ends on a chilling note. 8/10The Verb - This is by far one of my favorite songs on the album. Upon first listen, I wasn't sure if I liked it overall, but I was instantly drawn to the insanely catchy chorus. The more that I listened, the more I realized how layered and truly beautiful the song is. There are so many little aspects of the song that you do not catch on first listen, and the melody gets even more beautiful as the song continues. The climax of the song is met with Glen singing the chorus and being overlapped by Marketa singing her own thing, and the result is a gorgeous blending of melody and emotion that is like candy to the ears. 10/10I Have Loved You Wrong - This song is so soothing, that you can't help but close your eyes and become engulfed in the music. The enchanting melody is only helped by the subtle instruments carrying the song along like a leaf on a gentle breeze. This is one of the best songs that the group has written, and Marketa's voice suits it perfectly. The song ends with a heartwarmingly angelic harmony between Marketa and Glen, and it is perhaps one of the most beautiful things that I've ever heard. One line is repeated many times, and with each repeat, you can feel it tugging more and more at your heart. 10/10Love That Conquers - This song sounds like an old bardic folk song. It features some nice little harmonies, but the song overall tends to become a bit repetitive. However, the song is very nice. It's a great song to just relax and listen to. A very safe song with a simple yet nice tune. 7.5/10Two Tongues - To me, this song also plays very much like a Frames song. I enjoy the chorus, and I like the buildup to it. However, on song like this, I wish that Glen would display the beauty and raw power of his voice, because he stays mostly in his lower register. The piano part on this track is very nice at times, and it pierces through the guitar like a sword, which is welcoming. 8/10Back Broke - This song is a fantastic way to end the album. It's a quiet song with beautiful lyrics. It's song with Glen hardly using his voice, which makes it all the more effective. Additionally, Marketa's piano bits are very nice, and Glen's soft voice soars over them. The song has a wonderfully dark vibe, reminiscent to a storm cloud just before the rain. It ends the album on a very high note. 9.5/10Overall, Strict Joy is a true work of art. It seems to me that Glen Hansard walked into the studio and came out with a hybrid album that lays somewhere between The Frames and The Swell Season. The result of such an album, is a wonderful gem that any musician would be proud to add to their catalogue. When the album flies, it really soars. Sure, it may hit some turbulence along the way, but the ride for the most part is an extremely enjoyable experience. The original poem Strict Care, Strict Joy, said \"The poet makes grief beautiful,\" and Glen and Marketa have truly achieved that. The album is a must-buy, and plays like a warm night sitting around the campfire with old friends playing music and telling stories. Buy the CD, close your eyes, and savor it.\n", "val": 0.03262605890631676}
{"text": "The cd simply doesnt do the band justice. They are something to be experienced \"live\". I just saw them in MIlwaukee on Nov. 1st. They were nothing short of spectacular. Of all the live shows I've seen,(I've seen my share), Iwould say that this ranks as the best. You have to experience the power of Glen's voice, and the subtleness of Mar's for yourself. A lot is lost in the translation to cd. I was especially touched when Mar started play \"O Holy Night\" on the piano, and then singing about half the song through with her incredible voice. The Frames are simply fantastic. The bass shook your bones, the drumming was spot on for the music, the violin solos masterful. Glen is the John Lennon of our generation. His songwriting talent, guitar mastery, vocal talent, and presence remind me very much of him. He has that who gives a ***k attitude. Someone interrupted him when he was talking, and he got very mad! He's a man who loves his music and won't take anycrap from nobody. You have to admire him for that. I enjoyed the fact that both the live cd and dvd were recorded in MIlw. at The Riverside. Marketa commented on how lovely a city Milwaukee was. She even woke early in order to walk by the river and Lake Michigan. These 2 belong together.

Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are magical together (and lack something apart in my opinion). He gives her classical Czech, free-flowing instrumentals a harder, modern form. She gives his raw, Irish, folk rock ballads a lyrical, vocal and orchestral beauty and softness. Together they combine unlike forms and create new sounds and colors they cannot create or perform alone.[...]My very favorite new tracks:The RainHigh HorsesThe VerbIn These ArmsFantasy ManI Have Loved You Wrong (A Live Version, too that is haunting)Love That ConquersTwo TonguesLOVE THEM!!!!The article refers to the song \"The Verb,\" which Hansard wrote when he was with the Frames that he said was too dark to record before now.

{"text": "With 2007's deceptively layered breakout record The Con, Tegan and Sara Quin, along with uber-indie producer Chris Walla, reveled in the darker recesses of indie pop, merging unconventional song structures and atypically diverse instrumentation with the kind of incisive, realistic lovelorn tales the two long ago perfected. Few would have expected the record to chart as well as it did, and it's probably no coincidence that this, their sixth record, capitalizes on this. It's perhaps the band's most accessible to date, but these identical twins are hardly the likeliest candidates to be mainstream sellouts. Rather, Sainthood is a full-bodied, meticulously crafted rock record, one that stands firmly on its bedrock foundation of guitar, drums, and bass and lets the duo's way with words and distinctive personalities shape the album into yet another uniquely Tegan and Sara album.The two have always grounded their work in an essentially rock/pop mix, but never as blatantly as on Sainthood. Forgoing the quirky sonic soundscapes and expanded textures that characterized The Con, Walla beefs up the guitars and turns the amps up to 11, resulting in a thoroughly muscular record. From the jagged chords that open \"Arrow\" to the shiny keyboards and charging drum rhythm on closer \"Someday,\" Walla and the twins pulls no punches, concocting a potent blend of post-punk and polished pop-rock that rarely lets off the gas pedal. It's perhaps Tegan and Sara's most direct record to date, one that shines the spotlight squarely on what has always been the two's strongest asset: their lyrics.Tegan continues to play the role of designated hitmaker, penning catchy gems like propulsive first single \"Hell\" and the chiming alternative gem \"The Cure.\" Her specialty is striking a Cyndi Lauper-like balance between straightforward pop structures and hooks that refuse to let go with lyrics like \"screaming like no one might / call the cops and arrest you this time\" or the authentic verisimilitude of want-you-back anthem \"The Ocean.\" Sara, on the other hand, matches her oddball voice with suitably ambiguous lyrics and some of the more musically interesting tracks on the record. The funky Canadian (read: white) soul of \"Alligator\" finds her complaining of \"alligator tears cried over you\" and warns \"run around on me / die without,\" while the surprisingly poppy \"Red Belt\" admonishes one to \"slow it down, you have a tendency to rush back into your past / slow it down, you transfer all your weight and disappear / kneel, to condition all the feelings that you feel.\" For all their growth as lyricists and songwriters, Tegan and Sara repeatedly prove on Sainthood that not only do they work best when focusing on their everyday descriptions of love and broken relationships, but also when they continue their technique of writing songs separately. Each song here has a distinct Tegan or Sara identity, giving the album a well-thought-out sense of flow; in contrast, the one track written together, \"Paperback Head,\" never really develops a discernible theme and comes off like one of the few half-baked efforts here.On first listen Sainthood might even sound a bit bland to first-time listeners, as the similar production causes a few songs to blend together into generic punk-influenced alternative, particularly in the second half. But that comes off more as Walla's directive than the sisters', particularly when you consider how tightly wound the songwriting here is and how effectively the band delivers hook after delicious hook on top of consistently engaging lyrics. It's there on the stutter-step backbeat of \"Don't Rush,\" it's there on the snarling faux-punk anthem \"Northshore,\" and it's there in their enviable ability to make the listener care about their ubiquitous girl problems and obsessions. And really, who can't relate to girl troubles?\n", "val": 0.02397286891937256}

{"text": "Approximately two years after the release of popularly acclaimed The Con, the sisters come back with a fresh bid. And surprising as it may be, the twins actually wrote together on Sainthood, for the first time in over a decade of musical releases.\"Arrow\" provides a propelling start to the album, making the sisters' new, integrated energy instantly apparent. Tousled in a post-punk revival framework, the ladies' vocals--some damn catchy ones at that--make child's play out of first impressions. Next, \"Don't Rush\" confirms our initial inkling: Sainthood is colored with electronic add-ons almost in its entirety. Though certainly unexpected, this practice no doubt complements the style Tegan and Sara initially set out to create: a fan-pleasing blend of their last two albums. With this in mind, the Quins called back Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla and Howard Redekopp.Through focused balance, some of the tracks on Sainthood are able to effectively combine technical programming with the twins' poignant harmonies. And, as always, punchy choruses carry most of the weight in numerous songs. \"Hell\", the first single, showcases the album's dynamism through heavy power chords and some pretty dark inspirations.All throughout their sixth record, Tegan and Sara continue pushing towards a more expressive, swaggering lyricism, retrieving some of the adulthood garnered with their 2007 release. Though not as aggressive as The Con, Sainthood is equally energetic and despondent. \"I've got the cure for you\", Tegan sings on \"The Cure\", one of the catchier tracks on the record; this particular cut suggests a familiar song construction--often used by the duo--overly embellished to achieve an extremely marketable track. The Quins then take the record's punk-inspired antics a whole lot further with \"Northshore\", a self-indulgent `70s-inspired dash, and although the song adds to the overall potency of the album, it also becomes a bizarre middle point, inevitably losing significance when put into the album context.The following couple of songs bring forth a more paced demeanor. \"Alligator\" and \"Nightwatch\" both experiment with softer electronic arrangements, albeit not always successfully: the widespread use of cutesy synths can make the situation awkward for everyone involved. Other tracks like \"Sentimental Tune\" and \"Red Belt\" are reminiscent of some of the twins' earlier efforts, exposing more vulnerable lyrics and simpler arrangements.Overall, Sainthood is heavier than previous efforts, both lyrically and musically, and old fans will probably appreciate what this pair has accomplished together. However, for a new listener, the album might come off as a somewhat hard swallow; the songs are often too produced, and may even lack some honest musicality at their core. Still, Tegan and Sara deserve their fair share of recognition for their ever-changing style, and their guts to always explore new realms.\n", "val": 0.005324586294591427}

As always, the twins came up with catchy tunes and riffs, and at least one of these songs will get stuck in your head. And there's a wide variety of musical sounds on this record.

{"text": "Many of the albums I absolutely love took me a few listens to really appreciate.  Sometimes an album doesn't have that overwhelming feel that makes you go \"Wow... what was that!?\"  Sometimes you listen to an album and you are ready to dismiss it because you don't instantly connect with it, but then you figure, \"hey I spent money on this I guess I'll give it another chance.\"  That's me with this album.  My first time through I was so disappointed that it wasn't The Con part II I just about gave up on it.  Then I listened to it a few more times and I realized something.  This album really is just like every other T&S album: it's a departure from what they have previously done, though reminiscent of the past.  Once I pushed The Con out of my head and listened to this album, in as much of a void as I could, I fell in love with it.The Con overwhelmed me, it was an absolute force to be reckoned with.  You hear a song like \"Floorplan\" and you have to decide if you like it or not.  Sainthood is much more unassuming.  Its consistency, melodies, and subtle intricacies wore me down and won me over.  Again, if you are trying to draw comparisons between this album and The Con you will feel like somehow T&S abandoned their \"sound.\"  But if you are able to listen to Sainthood for what it is, you might be surprised how it's much closer to a heavier So Jealous.  Both albums are much more straight ahead Pop.I've seen many reviewers complain about the repetition on this album.  I just thought I would point out that this is nothing new for T&S (especially Sara's songs and this is the first album she contributed more than Tegan).  Look up the lyrics to Walking With a Ghost (no they didn't miss a verse).  After all these are the gals that gave us song titles like Monday, Monday, Monday and I Know, I Know, I Know - they like repetition.Overall, if you are a fan of Tegan and Sara (especially stuff off their last 2 albums) you will wind up loving this CD.

{"text": "I loved their last album, the Con, so much I have to admit I was hoping this would end up sounding like the Con part II. I knew better, but it didn't stop me. The Con was full of textured, layered melodies that could not hide. It was more calm, yet way more catchy and complicated.Sainthood, aside from a couple songs, is a different animal. At first listen the hooks aren't there. I was left bewildered. The songs sounded less creative and more generic. They still make use of all the beeps and boops and goofy background noise that help make T & S so unique. But after a few listens the melodies and hooks start to raise their collective heads and catch your ear.In my opinion, it's not as good as the Con. That doesn't mean it's bad. It's just a different direction. It sounds more straightforward and to the point. Unlike the Con, there are a few songs that I really don't want to listen to regularly. I find myself still skipping from one boring song to a more interesting song. And there are really great songs. I've always enjoyed Sara's songs more than Tegan's, and that hasn't changed. She really shines on songs like \"Alligator\" and \"Night Watch,\" with the latter possibly being T & S's catchiest and coolest song yet. It has an irresistible riff with a chorus that mimics it.Their influences can be heard throughout. Listen closely and you'll hear all kinds of 80s music. Tom Petty, Michael Jackson, The Cure. It's endless. If you are a child of the 80s, like me, these should jump out at you. It's a big part of what makes them so appealing.In summation, Sainthood is a solid T & S album. It's just not their best. I see no reason any T & S fan should not pick this up. Just be patient with it and don't give up on it. The hooks are there. You just have to wait for them.

It's all there just cleaner and crisper.I do admit it took me about 10 plays to figure this out. \"The Con\" was such a great album you don't expect something better. I don't think a direct comparison would be fair. \"The Con\" is about technique and \"Sainthood\" is about production. Like you built a cool ratrod and fianlly got it pinstriped.\n", "val": 0.005005080718547106}

{"text": "So are the tenties the new nineties? Sainthood is the first album I've heard from the Quinn twins, even though this is their 6th studio release.I did a double take when I heard the jangle pop of lead single 'Hell'. Had I landed back in time? A look at the album cover confused me further when I saw the sisters dressed in 80s college striped sweaters popular in the days of New Wave. Even their haircuts reminded me of that era. When I plunged deeper into the album, I felt like I was transported back to the early nineties when bands like Sleeper, Elastica and Echobelly were headlining the riot-grrrl movement. The 3/4 rhythm of 'Nightwatch' also recalls Juliana Hatfield's 'Spin the Bottle' with its disturbing intoxicating rock-waltz style.This album scores for its post-pumk sensibilities, and the twins'unique, hard vocals, brings to mind Cyndi Lauper at times, especially in follow-up single 'Alligator'.Partly fuzzy, fey and quirky, and all retro-prog good fun.\n", "val": 0.00899592787027359}

Now, I wouldn't call this their best work, and I don't like every song, but it's still pretty good.At first listen, nothing stood out to me, and I didn't find anything memorable. But now I actually have some songs stuck in my head -- they're catchier than I realized.Some of my favorites so far are the ones I mentioned above, plus \"Northshore,\" \"Sentimental Tune,\" \"The Cure,\" and \"On Directing.\"There are a couple awful ones (IMO). I'm not sure why so many people like \"Arrow\" -- I find the music incredibly grating on my nerves. Maybe that'll change, but right now I can't even bear to listen to it. \"Paperback Head\" is also pretty bad. But it may grow on me, who knows.Bottom line, don't judge this album based on one or two listens. Give it a chance to get under your skin.Also, check out the Bonus track \"Light Up.\" Eerie.

I'm particuarly fond of \"Hell\", and think that the album was ALMOST worth just that song, but alot of the songs seem like they have really childish/immature lyrics/vocal melodies (like \"Arrow\" and \"Don't Rush\").Give the album a full listen on YouTube before you buy it.

{"text": "I'm a new Tegan and Sara fan. I stumbled across them by accident and immediately fell in love. I've listend to So Jealous and The Con probably thousands of times each and still can't get enough. For me, The Con is by far one of the best albums ever. Each track stands alone, yet comes together as a suprising whole. I haven't listened as much to their older stuff, probably because I can't quit listening to their newer stuff.Sainthood, for me, is a great rock album with pop moments. I love Arrow, Hell, On Directing, and The Ocean. They're my favorite tracks from the album. I think any one of them could have wound up on The Con. This album seems to be a little bit heavier than their previous albums; gone are the acoustic tracks like Call It Off and Fix You Up and Soil, Soil. Replacing them, are poppy well written songs like Alligator and Paperback Head (the latter being my least favorite track on the album). Yet the craftsmanship remains absolutely great. I think for anyone, it's hard to follow up the album of a lifetime and when you do critcs and fans will always underappreciate it. But I think Sainthood is an excellent album. Yeah, the lyrics are repetative and the songs seem simple, but after a few listens I began to hear the complexities of them and their repetative nature resembles that of So Jealous (i.e. I Can't Take It, Walking With A Ghost, and We Didn't Do It).The reason that I rate it at 4 stars instead of five is because I really like their acoustic tracks and was bummed to find that aspect of their talent lacking on this album. I think that maybe Alligator would have lent itself well to an acoustic arrangment rather than its pop arrangement. However, I do love the heavier nature of Sainthood. Another reason is that each time I listen to the album, I tend to skip over Paperback Head and Someday. I don't believe they're bad songs, just not for me. There's not one song that I skip over on So Jealous or The Con. The final reason that I rate it at 4 stars is because these songs aren't as personal sounding as their previous songs. They don't come across in the way that they seem like they could've been pages ripped from the personal diaries of Tegan and Sara. I just don't find them wearing their hearts on their sleeves as they tend to. They seem a little more gaurded on this album, like they're hesitant to let the listener in quite as much as they had done on The Con.As an album, I find that Sainthood comes together well and each track is good as a stand alone or come together collectively and make a strong statement. It's overall a great album. I think they could definitly have done a worse follow up. I love it.\n", "val": 0.008778214454650879}

{"text": "I have been on the Tegan and Sara bandwagon since I started listening to them around the time of their excellent 2004 \"So Jealous\" album (still my favorite ablum of their to this day). 2007's \"The Con\" album was quite good too, but didn't quite bring the same enjoyment for me. Now comes the new album (ok, this was released in October, but I'm still catching up on some 2009 releases I never got around to fully exploring).WIth the opening sounds of \"Sainthood\" (13 tracks; 37 min.) on the opener \"Arrow\", it immediately feels like this album has an urgency that \"The Con\" never seemed to have. First single \"Hell\" is an irresitable pop song outright (reminding me of Metric, for one thing). \"The Cure\" is another single in the waiting. \"Alligator\" (second single) is another great tune, albeit not the attention-grabber that \"Hell\" or \"The Cure\" is, in my opinion. \"Northshore\" is almost a punk-like anthem (quite a long way off from their folksy-guitar beginnings). The songs on here are all in the 3 min, range, the Quin twins make their musical point and then move on, just great. The latter part of the album is actually the best for me, with outstanding tracks like the urgent, fast-tempo \"The Ocean\" and \"Sentimental Tune\" (which doesn't sound anything sentimental), and the jubilant closer \"Someday\", for me the best track on here.In all, this is quite the album. Close to \"So Jealous\", in fact. I saw Tegan and Sara in concert for the first time in 2005, and they were fantastic (and quite humorous in banter in between songs). Can't wait to see to see them again. If you wonder where you can hear this, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country, and where this album has been in heavy rotation these last couple of months.

I'd always be interested enough to check out their new material, though.  I'm really glad I did, because I was unexpectedly blown away by \"Sainthood\".  There is a new depth to the melodies that just wasn't there previously.  The music has moved to more \"power-pop\", with faster beats and more electronica influences to go with their usually strong lyrics.My favorite songs are probably \"The Ocean\", \"On Directing\", \"Red Belt\", \"Hell\", and \"The Cure\".

{"text": "It's true, their lyrics are still wonderful and their music is still inspired. But unfortunately their taste for space has soured. They used to use vocals sparingly and the musical space around them was a perfect frame. On this album, there seems to be a never ending stream of repetition that nearly drowns out the music and its crisp, ear-tickling production.Any given line/phrase on Sainthood may be fresh, quirky, brilliant, etc...but when repeated 12 times (literally) in the song it becomes cloying at best. Why would I ever need to listen to the song again when I've heard the chorus more in one listen than I've heard any So Jealous chorus in the last 5 years?That coupled with what seems to be a new tendency for Dr. Seuss-force rhyming gives me the impression that they didn't really take the same interest or pride in this album...like it was more work than play and they just wanted to fill 40 minutes to get something released.But of course, I loved The Con and many were as disappointed with it as I am with this. Maybe after a few more spins, I'll sink in further and won't notice these immediate annoyances.

{"text": "I wanted to love this, I really did. I honestly feel that this is going to be one of those albums that will be fiercely debated among fans, and there may be a great divide.I've been a longtime fan of Tegan and Sara since I first heard their album \"If It Was You.\" I've dutifully collected their albums since 2003, and have loved the majority of their music. There has been great departures from album to album, as if they're leapfrogging sonically through various sounds and musical styles. I can respect this, as I'd hate for a band to get pigeonholed as a one-note...however, this album-while still brilliantly written with a poignant concept- is a musical disconnect for me. Their earlier albums had a warmth to the music that has slowly dwindled away with \"The Con.\" While I still liked their last album (in a catchy, synth-pop way), \"Sainthood\" feels a little like those pop-punk studio recorded bands where the acoustic music is shined up and mechanized with digital samples and loops. I have no qualms with using layers of synthetic samples/loops/beats, but this feels like it doesn't fully devote itself to one side or the other. On top of that, I've never heard Tegan and Sara sound so divided. To me, it sounds as if they've given up trying to intertwine with one another and instead of collaborating as a unit, it's as if two split pieces are being held together for the sake of a studio album.The album is fine. I don't regret buying it. Musically, I just don't feel the visceral passion that was apparent in their previous work. I'm sad to say that while their writing has become richer and more beautiful, I'm also feeling more alienated from the actual music and melodies they picked to accompany the lyrics.\n", "val": 0.0009826081804931164}

It also has some humor in it too, which is a plus considering all the depressing sh** he did back on Killer and Sickology 101. Theres 3 different parts to the cd that the songs are all categorized into, The Anger, Madness, and the Hole. Some of his songs on this cd are kinda similair, I think to his old music but some disagree. I know a lot of people look down on Tech's new music but it's pretty much cuz he's been trying to clean up his music and get radio play, and nobody really stays the same in their music anyways so how can you really look down on his music, its just little different, thats all. Its not even that different from his old stuff. I think on this cd he trys to bring back that old school sh** he used to do but some say he just tried too hard on it. but I reccommend this cd really to anyone.

But fans shouldn't be alarmed, as the dark mood is often mixed with incredible production and clever punchlines throughout the album.I am personally a fan of every song on the album, but standouts include \"Show Me A God,\" \"Demons\" (feat. Three 6 Mafia), \"In The Trunk,\" \"Leave Me Alone\" and \"Strange Music Box\" (feat. Brotha Lynch Hung & Krizz Kaliko).If I had to pick a flaw, it would be some of the skits. Most of them fit with the album's concept, but the interview with Jason Whitlock doesn't offer anything new that Tech fans wouldn't know, besides a reminder that Tech is often criticized and accused of worshiping the devil. I understood the purpose of it, but I believe it could have been left off.Despite that, this album is worth purchase for any Tech fan.

Besides, what is wrong with appealing to the masses if you are still being true to yourself and making a quality product?  This album makes me feel like I did when I first heard Anghellic (or even \"Questions\" from the Gang Releated Soundtrack).  It's not the same as Anghellic, or any other Tech ambulm for that matter, but that is why I like his music so much.  People grow and change and it's cool when their music does a dope-ass job of reflecting that change.  Sometimes it doesn't always work for the artist, but Tech has never dropped the ball.  It kills me when people bash Tech because his albums don't sound the same.  Most people like his music because it is different.  I know that I've changed and grown over the past ten years, or so.  But hey, I can only speak for myself.  Anyway, if you haven't heard this album by now, what are you waiting for?  Listen to the tracks and buy the ones you like.

And now comes his next solo release K.O.D(King Of Darkness). Tech has done it again, with an album complete with sick beats and even sicker lyrics. The album includes a mixture of styles and feel, but he has taken it back to the darkness he was showing on Anghellic. Its great that Tech ignores all the people who talk about who they think Tech is and doesn't give into the talk. The album starts off with a serious song about his mother and God, and then it breaks down into the darker tracks. He has some good collaborations on the CD starting off with the first song Demons with Three Six Mafia. The song has a nice dark beat with a bit of a Three Six flavor mixed in, and Tech's raps are on point like always. Other people on the album include Brotha Lynch Hung, Prozak, Big Krizz Kaliko, and some new S&M talent. Its hard to pick out the best songs cause all of them are great, but my favorites have to be Demons, Blackened The Sun, Hunterish, In The Trunk, Pinocchiho, Horns, Shadows On The Road, and Leave Me Alone. There are some tracks where there are some interesting styles like Pinocchiho, Low, Killing You, and Hunterish. The song In The Trunk is a pretty cool song because of what the song is about. If I had to pick the best songs on the album I would say it was Demons, Blackened The Sun, and Shadows On The Road. But once again Tech N9ne has released a solid album that can be listened through all the way through over and over again.

He popped in KOD when we were rolling out to a club so we could get our heads into the right place. I didn't realize the 'place' that was going to take me ...Tech is an amazingly technical and intelligent artist. I won't call him a rapper ... I think \"horror artist\" fits him better. KOD certainly contains some of the most disturbing and off-the-wall album I've ever heard, which is why a lot of the music community is freaked-out by him and his cadre of like-minded artists. Tech, summed up in my own words, sings about the stuff that scares us the most deep down inside, and helps us get over our problems by listening to his.Five stars.\n", "val": 0.023536497727036476}

{"text": "Tech N9ne is easily the most creative and versatile rapper in the industry today. He owns his own label so he doesn't let the so called \"industry\" affect the content of his music, which is the only way the world could really see how talented this man really is. His style is unlike any other rap artist you have ever heard. And you are truly missing out some beautiful music if you have not heard of him.K.O.D. is a deep album that touchs on the dark side of Tech. It starts with the powerful \"Show Me a God,\" which covers religion and the health of his mother that is a great start to this album. The next 3 songs \"Deomons,\" \"Blackened The Sun,\" and \"Strange Music Box\" are all very dark highlights of the album with a verse from Brotha Lynch Hung that steals the show. However, like all greats these 3 are hard to follow, and the whole middle of the album (the madness section)suffers greatly, with the exception of \"Hunterish.\" \"Pinnocchio\" is a song that seems like Tech was trying WAY too hard to be dark with an awkward voice and the topic of cannibalism. King Gordy just goes over the top on \"Horns\", \"It Was An Accident\" just sounds lazy, and \"Check Your Temperature\" is just boring. The third section \"The Hole\" starts to pick back up. \"Low\" possibly the climax of the cd is deep and heart felt. \"Killing You\" is rock inspired banger that doesn't get old and the title track \"K.O.D.\" is a lyrical masterpiece with a very scary beat.Overall this album is worth a listen. If you are a fan of radio hip/hop such as Kanye West, Lil Wayne, or Gucci Mane you will find that Tech N9ne is much more personal and imaginitive in his music and his flow and speed is unmatched by anyone who has ever put their lips to a microphone. However, this is far from Tech N9ne's best album, see Everready (The Religion) and Absolute Power for that, it is one of the best albums put out in 2009.\n", "val": 0.0038096350617706776}

This album doesn't really have any entertaining songs like those found on Everready--however, there are still a few badass songs like Check Yo Temperature and B. Boy.There is a song on the album that doesn't conform to ANY of Tech's style, and that's Leave Me Alone. It sounds like a really mainstream song, even one that could be played on the radio. What happened to Tech's hatred for the industry? Isn't they punks?Show Me A God, Demons, Killing You, and Low are songs that let you know just how bad Tech is hurting.This is one of his best albums to date, definitely the darkest to date, and not to be taken lightly--buy this album.\n", "val": 0.002096587559208274}

{"text": "If you let it. It is very dark which is good if you like it, similar to relapse but in this album there's a little something for everyone. Unlike relapse from Eminem, in this one there is restraint. I don't hate relapse. Anyway, as I was saying in K.O.D. Tech sometimes comes close to crossing those boundaries in (the second part of the album) \"Madness\" but has a comical way about it and even considering the crazy lyrics, stays sane.The album is divided into three parts:  -Anger (5 Stars)  -Madness (5 Stars)  -The Hole (4.5 Stars)  -Anger is about just letting the rage out, anthems, hard bass, fighting, shooting whatever. His anger just comes out furiously. Everyone goes in lyrically.It's about letting the demons out, thus the track Demons w/ Three Six Mafia the ex kings of horrorcore.  -Madness is just crazy, the title serves it very well. In this part he talks about all kinds of crazy stuff & makes it sound funny, he is truly original in his songs. In the song \"In The Trunk\", he talks about throwing a clueless girl in his trunk so that she can learn to enjoy his music while it's banging in her ears, funny.  -The Hole is the darkest part of the album. In Shadows On The Road, he talks about spirits. Killing You is a very sad dark view of a relationship and the song Low can not get any lower. He then tries to bring the mood back up with Leave Me Alone which sounds very commercial but takes you right back down with \"King Of Darkness\" (his best) and ends the album marvelously with The Martini, a great story-telling. With this album Tech N9ne shows that he is truly the King Of Darkness, I could actually see a religion being formed from this, impressive. There's no doubt that this album is dark maybe even evil by religious standards but that's what gives it it's charm. It is not for everyone but as for the way it sounds, there is everything. It is very Hip-Hop (it's in serious competition with Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx 2), always lyrically sick, there are hype beats, it is somewhat commercial, the piano in this reminds me of classical music & there is even some rock in here. He has various styles.The intro \"Show Me A God\" is actually not part of the album but is a great way to start it, in this song he tells us what gave him the idea to make such a dark project, Tech Nina was obviously in some kind of depression due to his mother's sickness, she had pancreas cancer I believe & is now dead. So naturally you can tell he won't be making love songs, happy songs, no. Instead what he gives you is all his emotions filled into one cd. He goes through every human fear possible, he talks about it all: lust, murder, death, temptations. In my opinion this album is perfect & if you find it too much to bare, he has sworn there will not be a second K.O.D.  This LP takes you places if you let it long enough. The production is off the chain! The lyrics are enough to make your head spin & Tech Nina has got some insane flows as you are already aware of if you are a fan. I am a new fan so I don't care much for his older stuff, although I'm sure I'll get into it soon, I like \"Einstein\" and \"I'm A Playa\". This is my first Tech N9ne album and it won't be my last. I've had this album for about 16 hours & I have already listened to it many times, the length is just right for a replay. I'd recommend this to people who are open to different kinds of music as it is very unique. If you want a good, strangely addicting, quality album & are not easily offended, than look no further.\n", "val": 0.020563913509249687}
{"text": "This album is an instant classic and a must have for any Tech N9ne fan. Tech previously made two attempts to create a concept album with multiple parts that (IMO) fell short of the intended goal.K.O.D. achieves that goal as Tech brings that vintage sound that made us fall in love with his music back in 2001. This album is a perfect combination of \"Anghellic\" and \"Mizery Loves Kompany\" in tone and production. By Gangster rap standards K.O.D. is a horror-core album but doesn't push the envelope and go as far as traditional horror-core rappers like Brotha Lynch Hung, Esham and others. K.O.D. is toned down, less horror and more melancholic as Tech battles the demons within. The opening song (which comes before the intro) is the fuel behind Tech's anger and sadness of witnessing his mother fight a terminal illness. As a result he questions God's existence and motives. A theme that reprises A Perfect Circle's song \"Judith\".K.O.D. is perhaps the Tech people unfamiliar with his music assumed he was when they saw the full album cover of \"Anghellic\" for the first time. Perhaps he is buying into their assumptions of him just to go the distance. Maybe the album isn't an act and Tech really had some psychological issues that he needed to finally get out of his system as a result of industry blacklisting, a failed marriage and the medical issues his mother faced. Either way, it makes for great entertainment and in my opinion, is his best album\n", "val": 0.03754988685250282}
{"text": "ok, to start off i will be completely honest and state that ive only been a fan of TECH for about 2-3 years now. but to say that im a HUGE fan is an understatement. his lyrics and original sound makes him, in my opinion, one of the greatest artists/ songwriters of this or any generation.with that being said when i first purchased this album, i was, to say the least, ecstatic and more than anxious to pop it into my car c.d. player and blast it... after listening to it 2...3 times i was actually a bit bummed. it definetly wasn't my favorite, but i didn't hate it. but listening to the album over, and over, and over i've actually grown to love almost every song on K.O.D. it just grew on me. yea theres a few songs that i occasionally have to skip. but overall i think its a great album. either way, if your a TECH fan you have to go out and buy it. he could make an album with 2 songs for $15 bucks and i'd have to support him n buy it haha. so do your part. buy it online or at best buy, or walmart or wherever you can get it and decide for yourself!!!!.\n", "val": 0.03878621757030487}
{"text": "I am rating this a four right now because I still think Killer topped this one ... but the all time greatest albums take a month or so to really seep in.  Yea as one reviewer mentioned Killer was the best I think I heard from Tech though many seem to not like it as much as Sickology or early releases.I would definitely agree Tech keeps growing with every album.  As for the this being a mainstream album ... I guess I don't listen to mainstream music but if this is what mainstream hip hop/rap is sounding like these days ... maybe I need to.  This is by FAR the least mainstream album Tech has ever done in my opinion, so I don't understand a previous reviewer saying the contrary.  I feel more than any other album Tech made this strictly for himself first and foremost and didn't really care as much what anyone else thought ... which is not like him because I think he is someone who cares deeply about what his fans want to hear and see.  I can understand some fans not understanding/liking this album as much ... But like N9ne says he's never desired fame ... he's famous because he's a f*%! up, and we desire pain.  It is almost like a clearing of ones mind of all the inner battles.  One of the darkest albums I have listened to in a while ... but not dark just to be dark ... dark with a purpose.  I am proud of Tech and it sounds like he is getting some things worked out with himself.  I hope so and hope he continues to grow and expand his messages even more to his fans.  The time for gang bang raps and being sick just to be sick is over and played out.  Like Techs music evolving, so have a lot of his fans.  Tech mentioned he has sobered up in the past 3 years, I hope he stays on that path.I was unaware of how far the devil worshipping accusations went. A reviewer mentioned the interview was from Jason Whitlock?  Espn writer Jason Whitlock?  Forgive me I do not follow Techs life except for what he shares in his music or occasional interview I catch. It's hilarious to me the state of the world and the social breakdown of our society.  The top 1% having more than the bottom 99% combined and trust me Tech is not in that 1% ... and people are seriously questioning Arron Yates of worshipping the devil?  All the miseducation and corruption going on in the world and because Tech talks about it (and maybe partakes in it at times) he is a devil worshipper?  It is amusing.  Keep up the good work Tech, Kalico, Cutt, Prozac and others from the strange family.  Get this album.\n", "val": 0.004761494230479002}
{"text": "I have been waiting for this album for quite a while now, ever since last year I remember the whole buzz about K.O.D. and what it would stand for. I bought this album the day it came out, so I have had a whole week of listening to it. Well just to sum this album up quick, the title definately suits the content.This album is very dark. An interesting thing about this album are the stories, for example \"In The Trunk\", \"Pinocchiho\", \"Shadows On The Road\", and \"The Martini\". The stories show a sense of versatility and I definately respect that. The stories defintely have that dark feel to it, for example in \"Pinocchiho\", Tech N9ne speaks about wanting to be normal and loving to this woman, but instead he begins committing sexual acts and eats her up, which is very crazy if you think about it. I love \"Shadows On The Road\" and how it speaks about how Tech N9ne sees shadows walking across the road, and he believes that the reason for this is because of things that he did in the past and that they are haunting him currently.Aside from the stories on this album, there is a lot more. I love how the intro is the song \"Show Me A God\" and how it is a dedication to his mother. The interesting fact about it is that, this song is somewhat inspiring and definitely goes out for his mother, and isn't too dark, which makes sense because at the very end of the song he states \"Now let's get into K.O.D.\" which from there, the whole album gets dark. I love the transition and i also love how the songs are formatted, and I think it took some thought and it should be noticed. It is very uncommon to find albums now a days to be played in the actual recommended order, I usually just play songs randomly, but this album makes me want to play them in order.The lyrics on this album are very dark and interesting, different from some albums he has released, but that is not a bad thing at all. I love the production, I think it is very good, some songs are not too amazing, for example \"Leave Me Alone\", \"It Was An Accident\", and \"K.O.D.\", but I am more of a lyrics listener anyways. Not too much of a mainstream feel on this album, which is a plus. I am not a fan of the mainstream. The only song on here that gives me that mainstream feel is \"Leave Me Alone\".Now, my favorite songs, hmmmm.... this is a tough one. This album actually has some great heavy hitters on here. My favorites are \"Demons\", \"Killing You\", Strange Music Box\", \"Blackened The Sun\", and honestly the rest of the album is great as well. \"Demons\" is definitely one of the most well thought out songs, the children chorus is haunting and Tech N9ne's voice projecting louder and louder definitely keeps me amazed. The beat is amazing and the lyrics are well written. I love the song.My biggest concern is probably Tech N9ne's flow in this album. When I finished listening to this album, something wasn't right. I realized that Tech N9ne did not speed up and slow down like he usually does, for example on songs \"Imma Tell\", \"Come Gangsta\", \"Like Yeah\", and \"Midwest Choppers 2\" from his previous albums, just to name a few. He just used a normal flow and just very few times sped up, but nothing spectacular like in his other albums.Overall, I think this album is a great listen and worth the buy. I recommend this to anyone who likes underground rap music, great lyrics, great production, and even mainstream music. I like \"Everready (The Religion)\" a bit better than this one, and even \"Sickology 101\", but trust me, this album is very close, and a must need for your collection.Can't wait for the next album!\n", "val": 0.011983039788901806}

{"text": "Known for their song \"Around the Bend\" which is featured in iPod commercials, the band from Copenhagen, Denmark's debut album \"Fruit\" is characterized by exaggerated vocals, beats built from a myriad of sounds, and a rather interesting use of horns.  The band, consisting of vocalist Mette Lindberg and producer Lars Iversen, have built a sound in which classic guitar riffs and drums back computer generated sound.  The most interesting thing about their sound is that the technosonic touches are not jarring or grating, they seem to integrate into the sound without much friction.  Many people who try to integrate both technosonic touches with classic drums and guitar do so in such a way that either side is rendered useless.  In \"Fruit\" The Asteroids Galaxy Tour integrates the two with precision, allowing both sides to contribute to the overarching sound.  Lindberg's unique voice brings the whole thing together with interesting and varied lyrics. For me, the most interesting thing was the use of different instruments and sounds in order to create a unique sound.  Throughout the album you can hear the use of computer generated sounds, synthesizers, guitars, drums, brass instruments, and I think I even heard a xylophone in there somewhere...  This creates a unique sound that only they are able to muster. \"Fruit\" sets the stage for the album with the opener \"Lady Jesus.\"  The song begins with a single trumpet sound, followed by drums, guitar, and vocals.  As the song reaches its refrain, the computer generated sounds enter with a sound I don't think I can describe, but it fills out the sound.  This is seen throughout the album where the rock sounds of the guitar and drums seem incomplete and are filled out with computer generated sounds that bring the sound full circle. As the album moves forward it ebbs and flows from songs with quick tempo to slower songs that seem to plod along.  All the songs on the album aren't gems, but the concept seems to me to be the more important aspect.  Each song seems an experiment with the different sounds at hand and seems like all that experimentation will lead to good things in a follow-up.  There are moments that feel a bit overproduced, others that feel underproduced, and some that just don't sound quite right, but they all seem to work towards a goal of a complete sound.  There are good things to come from this band so watch out.As music that integrates classic rock instruments with hip hop like studio production becomes more prominent, it will be interesting how these bands evolve the genre.  It seems that this is a step in a direction where you see even more sounds brought together in the studio in order to create new musical paradigms.  This can only be a good thing. This is one of those bands that I feel would blow you away live.  With all the different instruments and sounds, it would be an experience unlike any other.\n", "val": 0.011373122222721577}

Then I waited after many delays for A Lost Christmas Eve and it came did not disappoint. It has been 5 years sense the last TSO album and its finally here! I remember hearing the preview songs and was not totally thrilled. It seemed over done, too clean, and it seemed there was too much hype that no album could ever overcome.But the thing about Night Castle that makes a purchase worth it is the lyrics. TSO lyrics have only gotten better. My favorite song from their first album, Old City Bar, was the beginning of showing TSO's true colors. They aren't just about rocking out with electric guitars playing famous classical pieces....rather they take their time creating lyrics that mean so much more. \"There was a life\" may be my new favorite TSO piece over \"What is Eternal\" from the Beethoven CD. Not only do the lyrics have so much meaning but there seems to be a lot of effort in each song. Most songs are about 5 minutes long with some shorter and the longest at around 10. The sheer size of quantity AND quality show how much work has been put into this album.Cons -1. Seems overdone and over edited in some places2. We have been waiting 5 years! So it may be too hypedPros -1. Price is great for this double album2. It seems there has been more effort put into this album than any other3.

You know, not to show my age, but back in the day,  you bought an album because you heard something on the radio..... Thank God for the internet. It really has opened doors for music fans to find far flung and lesser known-and much better-bands than the repetitive junk that came on (and still does)  top 40 stations.\n", "val": 0.02070116251707077}

I'm not a hardcore music guy, and it's sometimes difficult to get into newer music that just all seems to sound the same as it has for the past 10-15 years.

Stop here if you are looking for a good story exploring good and evil, duty and love, pain and redemption.Yes, the music is the typical Trans-Siberian Orchestra blending of rock and classical music. However, the story is one that seems to echo in this time. I am so glad my friends gave me this album (2 CDs); I think you will miss something essential if you have only the streaming music or MP3 versions. The booklet included with the CDs adds depth to the sung story, not to mention Greg Hildebrandt's wonderful art deserves admiration.I think this quotation is what I will take away: Do not dwell on the monstrous injustices done by humanity to humanity, since the dawn of mankind, more than you study how these wrongs and injustices were corrected. The study of the individuals and civilizations that overcame these evils is the key to mankind moving forward.If you enjoy the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, I think you will like this.

The Asteroids Galaxy Tour gingerly treads the line between rock and pop; the sound is at once as light and poppy as any '50's chart-topper but simultaneously has a unique rock n roll-like instrumentation (consisting of much brass, how hot is that!?), with no shortage of bass to keep you groovin'.  Best of all though, is the leading lady's voice - at first her sound may make you think that this is contrived pop for the prepubescent, but listen closer: there are some underhandedly sexy lyrics here, and she puts enough soul into their delivery that you actually buy them.A rich, enjoyable debut, that I can't wait to get as an LP.\n", "val": 0.019102472811937332}

I love all the songs here,\"Satellite\" \"The Golden age\",\"Sunshine coolin'\", of course \"Around the bend\", just to name a few, man they are ALL wonderful!  This Band SO deserves MAJOR radio support - tho I don't really expect them to get it, thank God for Youtube.  If you like fun music, check 'em out, you'll be glad you did.

The point is it's different and sometimes variety is the spice of life. The concept is good the rythems are all consistent through out the songs easy to interpet and easy to listen to with just the right amount of quirkyness that makes you want to hum it or sing along. The vocals are childlike in a good way a Danish person singing in English gives just the right amount of differing tonal quality to regular words again makes them quirky, I like it. The percussion is simple but intricate and very polished as are the horns and reeds very together a touch of Memphis Muscle Sholes with some funk and quirky vocals....this review putting you off don't let it well worth the investment buy it it's different.\n", "val": 0.018368680030107498}

{"text": "Like other reviewers, I discovered this band via commercials for iPOD (Around the Bend) and Heinekin (The Golden Age).  This band rolls up three or four decades of funk styles into a fresh and fun package that sounds up to date while having a dose of retro. \"The Golden Age\" is also available on their EP of the same name, but if you want \"Around the Bend\" as well, then \"Fruit\" is the way to go as well.  I really also like \"Attack of the Ghost Riders\" and \"Bad Fever\" - and some of the other songs as well.  That makes this album a great value in my eyes.  And I wasn't sorry I bought the EP as well, since it has a few really good tracks too.\n", "val": 0.021464936435222626}
{"text": "Amazing sound - but a bit different. Funk, blues, even a little psychodelic - with a hint of trance. Great use of horns - nice drums and bass guitar. But, the vocals are what makes these songs. If you don't like Mette's voice, you might not like the album. I, however, am fascinated by it. The hardest problem with a new sound is that your mind is constantly trying to guess when the chord changes, refrains, etc. are going to happen - and what they will be.  You really have to listen to each song more than once to appreciate it. The brief clips Amazon offers can't really do any of the songs justice. Some songs, such as Push the Envelope use the first half of the song to set up the second. Others, such as Crazy, are sublime in their simplicity. Every song is different. My favorite \"new sound\" album since \"Tragic Kingdom\" by No Doubt (I know, it was technically their 3rd album - but the first I came across them). I'd put Fruit in the same break-through category as Parallel Lines and Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This). I'm only disappointed that they are getting nearly no U.S. exposure - other than the Apple and Heineken commericals that use their songs. However, Heineken's \"The Entrance\" commerical is what spurred me to search out who was behind the commercial's music.\n", "val": 0.001123726018704474}

While this album is slightly lacking in vocals and in lyrics compared to some of TSO's earlier offerings such as \"Christmas Eve and Other Stories,\" it is nonetheless appealing for the fact that it is not targeted for a specific time of year.The album launches in a glorious attack: \"Night Enchanted,\" which is a modern take on Verdi's haunting \"Dies Irae,\" but also establishes several of the motifs that are repeated throughout the album.The second track, \"Childhood Dreams,\" begins what seems a story of growing up. This song is perhaps the most lacking in lyric originality, but does an excellent job of setting up the next song, and is still a rather entertaining listen.\"Sparks,\" Night Castle's third offering, is a lot like some of the grittier songs of the Christmas albums, and continues the growing-up motif.\"The Mountain\" takes its epic riffs from Grieg's \"Hall of the Mountain King,\" which is arguably among the most epic of classical pieces, so there's no way that TSO could go wrong here, and \"Night Castle\" does not disappoint.Next up is the titular track which, despite being one of the weaker offerings lyrically, still manages to catch the listener up on a guitar-laden adventure through--you guessed it--a castle at night.The sixth offering that \"Night Castle\" gives us is \"The Safest Way Into Tomorrow.\" This is likely my favorite song on the album, possibly because of the allusions to Classical Mythology, or maybe because sleep, the subject of the song, is what I should have been doing when I was listening to music instead.\"Mozart and Memories\" is a nice song, very TSO in atmosphere. It builds up to a soaring crescendo, then backs off, before repeating the process several times.\"Another Way You Can Die,\" the next song on the roster, has a fun beat, but is probably the weakest overall offering on the album. By which I mean, it's still a great song, just not AS great as many of the others. Mainly, it seems somewhat out of place with the other songs on the album.\"Tocatta\" is another fun TSO song, in the same vein as \"Mozart and Memories.\"\"The Lion's Roar,\" the album's tenth offering, begins with a slow trumpet introduction that forms a nice reprieve from the loud guitars of some of the other songs, before building into an epic rock piece itself.\"Dreams We Conceive\" is another great song, with a hopeful feeling as the night that has overshadowed the album begins to break into day.\"Mother and Son\" is confusing. It would probably make more sense if the MP3 album came with a digital booklet, partially since it is not in English.\"There Was A Life\" is another favorite. I find it encouraging, and it is easily one of the most lyrically strong offerings on this album. Great song.\"Moonlight and Madness\" takes the Moonlight Sonata and turns it into an epic and fun piece of pure TSO.\"Time Floats On\" hearkens back to the childhood motif, and has a lovely chorus to boot. It also fits really well with the whole feel of the album.\"Epiphany\" forms the beginning of the album's climax, and its somewhat rough vocals are a perfect fit with the song, in all of its 11-minute glory.\"Bach Lullaby\" offers a reprieve in the middle of the action: it's music-box vibe lends greatly to the whole childhood theme.\"Father, Son & Holy Ghost\" is an interesting song, starting off slowly, growing ever more anxious, and finally launching into a furious crescendo that lasts for a whole four minutes. Another favorite, partially for the interesting lyrics.The next track, \"Remnants of a Lullaby,\" hearkens back to \"Bach Lullaby,\" only with actual vocals and instruments and a tone that is both hopeful and mournful.\"Night Castle begins to wrap to a close with \"The Safest Way Into Tomorrow [Reprise],\" which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like.By now, the Sparks have gone, and only \"Embers\" remain. This track sounds very much like it could have been on any of TSO's Christmas albums, but is not out of place here.Remember that motif set up by \"Night Enchanted?\" Well, here it is again, presented in \"Child of the Night,\" the last song of the overarching concept of the album. It brings a fitting sense of closure to the album......but we're not over yet! \"Believe\" offers a hopeful but somewhat confusing piece to the album, \"Nutrocker\" is fun but feels like it should have been on one of the Christmas albums, \"Carmina Burana\" is an excellent and faithful adaption of Orff's classic (which inspired songs on the \"Star Wars\" soundtrack), and \"Tracers\" is a fun rock-oriented piece to round out the album as a whole, even if it doesn't quite feel like anything else.Additionally, \"The Flight of Cassandra\" is a fun piece, full of energy, that makes this album a very solid bargain on Amazon.Overall, this album shows Trans-Siberian Orchestra at some of their greatest peaks of creativity, and is best listened to as a whole. It is definitely a worthwhile purchase for anyone who is a fan of TSO or their style, and even those who find certain genres unappealing should be able to find at least one song that they enjoy on this excellent album.\n", "val": 0.008766364306211472}

{"text": "hours worth of material.  It is an ambitious project to be sure, and one that I predict would not sway fans or non-fans either way on their opinions of the band.  Everything that people love or loathe about TSO can be found here.  This is symphonic / progressive / broadway rock at its most bombastic.  For fans of the bands pre-TSO incarnation, Savatage, at least some of this will sound similar in style and substance.  In fact this is probably the most Savatage like album TSO has done so far.  Bottom line, if you have liked TSOs other albums (or Savatages more rock opera ish releases); you will probably enjoy this one.  If previous TSO efforts have turned you off, this one will probably not do anything to change that point of view.\n", "val": 0.0006486154161393642}

As a matter of fact, they do. There is none to compare to TSO. They are in their own catagory. Now, for the downside..............They will blow you away. But, if you are fortunate enough to see them in concert, then it's almost impossible to listen to the CD's for awhile, because it falls short of what you saw. Now, know this, they only do Christmas music. My favorite Christmas song is Oh Holy Night. I am a devout Christian and had anybody ever told me my favorite version would be on electric guitars, I would have been offended and think them crazy. But, it's true!! And it's done with such reverence, as is every song they do. I have seen Springsteen, Santana, Bob Seger, Jackson Browne, REO Speedwagon, ELO, Dallas symphony and the Moody Blues 13 times, (to name a few) but nothing can prepare you for TSO. Excuse me, but that's what their fans call them, short for Trans-Siberian Orchestra. No one, I mean no one has ever seen TSO in concert one time! Once you see them, it becomes your new automatic Christmas tradition. Christmas will never be the same again. My biggest complaint is that they only did one DVD in 1999, but I told Al, lead guitar, it should be a law that they should have to do one every year!  If you ever get the chance to see them, do not pass it up. I saw them in Dallas, twice, Grand Prairie, and Shreveport, LA.

Their live performances are unmatched in musicianship, pyrotechnics, and light show. They are clearly one of the best groups that are actively recording and performing today. With that said, my personal opinion is that this CD doesn't live up to the quality of their previous work. The lyrics are interesting, but there isn't the same type of diversity in vocals that was one of the hallmarks of their previous efforts. The instrumental music, although well done, also did not seem to have the fresh groundbreaking sound that one has come to expect from the Trans Siberian Orchestra.The strength of this CD is the lyrical structure and the plot/story. This Cd had the potential to be one of their best efforts, but unfortunately falls a bit flat when considered in its totality. I want to underscore that this is my particular view of this specific effort. Others may hold divergent views on TSO's most recent effort.\n", "val": 0.0031840286683291197}

{"text": "I never really got into Savatage, but I became a big fan of TSO ever since Christmas Eve & Other Stories was released in 1996 (a tune like \"Sarajevo 12/24\" was totally bad-ass to an 11 year old, and it still sounds great). In a way I grew up on TSO (I'm now 25), and their Christmas CDs have been a staple every holiday season. Night Castle was supposed to come out shortly after The Lost Christmas Eve, only to be delayed time after time (I remember seeing them in 2005, where they played Camina Burana, thanked the fans for their patience and assured us the album would be out sometime in 2006). Eventually it just became a running joke, like it would end up becoming the next Chinese Democracy (which ended up beating Night Castle out by nearly a year).Instead of jumping on here immediately after hearing Night Castle, I figured I would allow some time to properly absorb the album before giving my two cents, especially since it's such a massive album. Well I ended up giving it a year, and after recently giving it yet another listen, there's no other way around it: a lot of this is TSO at their dullest and most uninspired. Some reviewers have complained that the album doesn't reflect the several years of work that went into it. I think it does, but in a negative way: the album just seems overproduced, over-thought, too clean and meticulously arranged. The tempos are so locked down (not to mention slow), the drums and keyboards so artificial sounding, that all the life and soul seems to be sucked out of it. Even most of the guitar solos and riffs, while obviously performed by talented guitarists, sound perfunctory and relatively lifeless. And for some reason, TSO has been phasing out the \"rock\" vocalists, in favor of more and more quasi-classical \"Broadway\"-type singers (Lost Christmas Eve is guilty of this too), so there's very little of the variety that made their first two albums so great - bring back Tommy Farese! Some have pointed out that the best songs here are the bonus tracks at the end, and I'm inclined to agree. Even \"Believe\", though a fairly pointless re-recording of the Savatage song with a different vocalist, at least has more emotion in it than most of the other stuff here.I'd hate to think that TSO can't pull off a non-Christmas album (though apparently some of you really like Beethoven's Last Night), but I don't think either of them come close to matching their trio of Christmas albums. Whether they try something else or retreat back to the Christmas theme for Album #6, I hope it's a lot better than this, and I hope we don't have to wait another several years to hear it.\n", "val": 2.7309108190820552e-05}
{"text": "Without trying to echo so many previous reviews, I give you the following.  I tried, very hard, to like this CD.  I truly appreciate TSO's Christmas music - my family plays all three discs every Christmas season.  I've seen the band live in concert, and they put forth an awesome live concert experience.  Having stated that, this disc set falls short in many areas.  The recording quality is less than stellar - on high grade equipment, the high end is sorely lacking - the cymbals and high hats are mixed far into the background, leaving us with a muddy and shallow sound in the music.  The vocals seem uninspired and straining.  The story seems to echo those in the Christmas stories, and the melodies and vocals seem overly predictable - as if you've heard it all before.  The redeeming qualities are that the musicianship is excellent - the best part of the set are the \"bonus\" tracks at the end of disc II.  If you're a die-hard fan, you will appreciate this set.  If you're simply a fan of the Christmas music of TSO, I fear that you will find this set repetitive, uninspiring, and something that you will play far less than the Christmas discs.\n", "val": 0.0001348246878478676}

Most of all, I do love the way she imbues these songs with wisdom and experience; \"Anticipation,\" from this vantage point, is tender and heartbreaking.  The new ending to \"Coming Around Again\" captures the resignation that romantic disappointment brings in a way that the original did not (listen to how Carly Simon sings \"the rhythm went out of our romance\").  The title cut makes me wish I were in some tavern by the ocean with a group of old friends, although it sounds pretty good here in the flat midwest, too.  Carly Simon's brilliance lies in her ability to evoke contradictory emotions in a deceptively simple, conversational manner.

It was a little shocking to me, really.That said, there are some lovely reimaginings of her work here. \"That's the Way I've Always Heard it Should Be\" is wonderful in a way completely different from the original. \"You Belong to Me\" is not better, but interesting in this fresh take, as is \"Let the River Run.\"The new approach doesn't benefit all the tracks: \"Boys in the Trees,\" \"Right Thing to Do,\" and \"It Happens Everyday\" are, if not clunkers, at least not better than the originals.At the end of the day, it's a fitting swan song, which is what it feels like, to a prolific and varied career.

And the \"embellishments\" to It Happens Everyday and You're So Vain are just excruciating and embarrassing - as noted by several commentators.

{"text": "Carly Simon's 2009 'Never Been Gone' is a beautifully intimate and thoroughly enjoyable album throughout. All the 11 re-works on 'Never Been Gone' have been done in a beautiful acoustic and folk style. Despite the passing year's, Carly's more mature vocals and arrangements allow both the original and the rework to be appreciated as two totally different concepts and proudly stand side by side as two separate works. Standout tracks for me.AnticipationBoys In The Trees,Coming Round AgainLet The River RunNever Been GoneThat's The Way I've Alway's Heard It Should BeAll of the above are totally haunting versions and I thank you dear Carly, for it all. Only one of the 11 reworks disappointed me. Funnily enough it was also Carly's biggest ever hit 'You're So Vain'.

Luckily with my pc audio programmes I've managed to edit out this annoying arrangement and bring all to a happy close for me,my pc and my ipod.Would of been a glowing 5***** review if 'You're So Vain' had been better arranged.Other than that I thoroughly recommend this album to anyone.\n", "val": 0.015791025012731552}
{"text": "I've always had a geeky affection for Carly Simon's music.  She brings honesty and intimacy to her best recordings, often peppered with larger truths and observations that range from the humorous to the heartbreaking, wrapped in hummable tunes.  Carly is at her best when she brings to the table what she is feeling now in words she hasn't said before, as she did in her best albums:  Anticipation, No Secrets, Hello Big Man, Coming Around Again, and Letters Never Sent.  She's at her worst when she reinterprets the music of others:  her voice often lacks the control and power of true interpreters.What to do, then, when she reinterprets her own material, often decades after the fact?Her voice, while still pleasant to listen to, has diminished somewhat with age, although certainly not the way the voices of her more commercially relevant (Stevie Nicks) or artistically relevant (Joni Mitchell) peers' voices have.  What prevents this album of reinterpretations from becoming a \"must have,\" then, is the largely uninventive arrangements.  The originals already had a sense of emotional intimacy, so stripping down the arrangements certainly did not add that element to the mix.  And while a pared down arrangement can often reveal the gem of the song at the core of the recording, these arrangements occasionally feel lethargic compared to the originals.Nonetheless, there are some pluses to be had here.  The songwriting is still superb and holds up after all these years.  Furthermore, the sparse arrangements to lend an air of physical proximity to the artist:  One often feels, listening to these songs, that one is eavesdropping on a closed jam session, or sitting in the living room with the singer herself and hearing the germ of an idea as it first develops.  It's almost as though Carly is saying, \"So I have this idea for a song called 'You're So Vain,' and I'm going to give you what I've managed so far... what do you think of it?\"  To that extent, it does add to one's musical collection in the same way that an appendix or a footnote adds to a body of literature:  It may not suffice as a story unto itself, but it adds a layer of understanding to that story.\n", "val": 0.0008930987096391618}

But I was drawn to listen to it again, and then to read the liner notes, and then to listen to it again and again.My apologies to Ms. Simon for any doubts I had.  You may think her voice is not the same as it was.  Is yours?  There is criticism of her revisiting these songs.  These are her songs - as some say, her children, and she has been gracious enough to open her family up for our listening pleasure. We should all be so lucky as to have a collection of pieces as sensitive, as contributory as these.  They made me quite introspective of where I was when I first heard them, and where I am now.

{"text": "You have to give Carly Simon her just dues...after what was arguably one of her most prolific decades to date, you would think she just might kick back and relax for a bit. I mean, over the last ten years we've had a batch of eclectic, albeit brilliant, originals (2008's THIS KIND OF LOVE), 2007's soothing INTO WHITE, a reunion with Richard Perry in 2005 (for the lush standards collection MOONLIGHT SERENADE) and 2000's extremely personal THE BEDROOM TAPES. A break should definitely be in order, right?!? No way! Instead, Simon chose to wrap up the decade with NEVER BEEN GONE, a stripped down reimagining of many of her famous hits. Raw and unadorned, NEVER BEEN GONE is an important record for a number of reasons. First, it shows just how strong a songwriter Carly Simon really is...these songs are as powerful now they were thirty to forty years ago. It also shows what a true artist is...unafraid, vulnerable, honest. There are moments here when Simon's voice doesn't come across nearly as strong as on the original version, but, hey, that's cool...very few artists can say they do! At 64, Simon has earned he scars...and her accolades! Opening the disc with a relaxed version of \"The Right Thing To Do\", Simon sets the mood from the get go. Switching things from a piano based arrangement to an acoustic guitar one allows for a more easy-going vibe, which is only enhanced by ethereal backing vocals. Simon's lead vocal is slightly ragged, but that just adds to the overall effect, resulting in a comfortable groove. \"It Happens Every Day\" is one of the songs that benefits most from it's reworking. Originally a more subdued, sad reflection on and of loss, there's almost a lilt to the new version. Yes, it's still about the pain caused by the end of a relationship, but there's more wisdom present now, the knowledge that life DOES go on. This is all captured in a gorgeous lead vocal by Simon. One of my two favorite tracks off of NEVER BEEN GONE. The disc's title track experiences one of the more...unique...reworkings. Originally a hushed, almost religious, effort, the new take has a swaying, waltz-like feel to it. As Simon sings \"The wind is coming up strong and fast/And the moon is smiling on me\", the listener is totally transported to another time and place. Absolutely lovely! \"Boys In The Trees\" is, without a doubt, my favorite cut on the album. There's a hypnotic urgency to the track, what with it's captivating arrangement, gorgeously layered lead vocal and haunting harmonies, courtesy of John Forte and daughter Sally Taylor (Why, oh, why has she stopped recording?!?!?). Everything about this version is sheer perfection....love, love, LOVE it!! I've never been a huge fan of \"Let The River Run\" ~ I've always thought \"Coming Around Again\" was much more deserving of the Oscar ~ but this version kind of grows on you. Starting out slow and acoustic-y, it builds in intensity, but never goes over the top the way the original does. In fact, this version is much more...spiritual. Nice! Simon's reworking of \"You're So Vain\", along with Matthew Sweet's and Susanna Hoffs' cover earlier this year (without a doubt the best thing about their UNDER THE COVERS VOL. 2), proves the song is, as stated by Rolling Stone, one of rock's Top 100 Greatest Songs. More primal and a lot more vicious, the energy just spits out of the speakers. Simon's lead vocal is equal parts gritty, growling, cryptic and crisp, while the arrangement is clever, but never cluttered. I guess you CAN go home again...and enjoy the trip! \"You Belong To Me\" is almost a miss for me...it's way too \"lounge-y\" for my tastes, lacking the sly, sexual heat of the original. However, Teese Gohl's stunning piano fills and some gutsy backing vocals lift it out of the \"loser\" column and put it smack dab in the \"O.K.\" one (I would have really liked to have seen this one tirned on it's head, be it thru a Country, dance or rock take). \"No Freedom\", the first of two new tracks, is a fun little ditty, and a direction I'd like to see Simon move in on future recordings...quirky, edgy, spirited. However, she almost gets lost on her own album...this is just as much a Ben Taylor cut with Mom on backing vocals as it is a Carly Simon track with son Ben guesting. Cheers for believing in your offspring, Carly...but this is your record! \"That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be\" is the only cut on NEVER BEEN GONE that doesn't work at all. While most of the songs benefit from added age and experience, \"That's The Way....\" is all about youth and starting out and the accompanying doubts. The arrangement pales compared to the original, while the lead vocal is shaky. I know she had to include the song, but I would have much rather had a percussion-driven version of \"Jesse\" in it's place. \"Coming Around Again\" gets off to a rocky start, with a lead vocal that's pinched and nasaly. In fact, it's almost comical. However, the arrangement is delicate and fresh, and how can it NOT tug on your heart when Simon sings the words \"I believe in love...What else can I do?\" Simon's vocal rights itself by song's end, particularly on the powerful outro....\"If I can just breathe\"....wise words. \"Anticipation\" is as touching as ever, but it's overall vibe is kind of flipped...while the original is all giddy and hopeful, this new take hints at inner doubts and uncertainties. And, yet, it still works. And Simon's lead vocal? WOW! From growl to purr, it's up front, forceful and focused. Definitely one of the disc's high points! Rounding things out is \"Songbird\", a song Simon first started back in 1970. Coming across it 39 years later, she polished it up and finished it off. A pretty piano ballad storysong, Simon's 1970's vocal nicely segues into her 2009 one, showing where Simon has been, where she's at, and, hopefully, where she can still go. And that's the true magic of NEVER BEEN GONE...Carly Simon is a classic artist who's still incredibly relevant. Here's hoping she won't be GONE for years to come! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for not only including the lyrics, but also commenting on why she chose each song, and how the reworkings came about. Kudos also for the cover artwork;VERY un-Simon, it's clever and fun!).\n", "val": 0.03908400982618332}
{"text": "Listening to this CD one wonders why an artist should decide to re-record material. There might be very good reasons. For example, that nowadays DDD quality can be delivered, and in fact in the studios anything can be done to create an incredible sound. This could have been the case with this CD from Carly Simon. I regret to say that is isn`t. If you put the disc in your player you immediately think: where has the percussion gone....the strings.....are these guitar-sessions..??Neverthelesss, it is not a bad CD. Outstanding, in my opinion is the new arrangment of \"\"Boys in the trees\"\", really a pleasure to listen to. Very pleasurable too, is the new arrangement of That`s the way I have always heard it should be\". Re-recoring You`re so vain, after almost 30 years is a very legal thing to do,and Carly did. It did not turn out well, a missed chance. Using todays technical possibilities this could have been a smash. Sometime one might get the idea that Mrs. Simon has become a little afraid of using her (powerful) voice, that she doesn`t want to go for it.GO for it next time, Carly, suprise us!!\n", "val": 0.005784587003290653}

I like this album, it brings back memories; although some of the arrangements for well known songs seem a bit too quirky for my tastes.  I particularly like the rerecording of \"You're So Vain\" and I hope they release it as a single so that a new generation may fall in love with Simon's wonderful songsmithing.  \"That's the Way I Always Heard It Should Be\" still retains it's haunting quality.  Some of the other remakes take some getting used to though.  The 2 original tracks \"Songbird\" and \"No Freedom\" seem like discarded \"b\" sides though--almost as if they really don't belong with the material recreated here. I can't blame Simon though, in order to qualify for a possible Grammy Award an albums must have at least 1 new (not previously recorded) track.I am only giving this recording 4 stars because I feel that Simon's penchant for redoing her own material is starting to wear thin with me.  I welcome the album, but found her previous album, This Kind of Love to be superior.  I will say, however,  Never Been Gone is a step up from Into White and her collections of old standards.The bottom line is, if you are a Carly Simon fan, as I am--you will buy and enjoy Have You Seen Me Lately.

When they're not touring during the winter months, it begs the question, what are they doing, that it took so long to produce?

There are only a handful of instrumentals, which are honestly the only songs worth listening to.  The one exception is the rendition of Carmina Burana.  However, the remaining songs with vocals are way overdone and even irritating to the point I can't even finish the song - I never thought I would ever say such a thing about a group I liked so much in the past.  Many of the songs sound similar and are repetitive, again, to the point of irritation.  This is NOT the TSO I knew and loved in the two concerts I've seen them in - not at all.

Actually, since much of their music is classically based, you really need to listen to them like an orchestra, whether live in concert or on CD - to fully appreciate them.  Their latest is best in the last two cuts, both of which were featured in this year's Christmas concerts.  The first is based upon the third movement from Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" Sonata, and is magical.  The last - a supposedly free and extra cut - is based upon Orff's Carmina Burana.  I've been listening to and collecting Classica Red Seal Victrola Opera records from 1902 onwards for twenty years (a unique and inexpensive hobby) and their Soprano \"Bling Singing\", which consists of veritable pointillism as arpeggios (the blonde Sopranos in each show are unique and quite good) actually hearkens back to many classic Opera singers, especially the famous Romanian, Amelita Galli-Curci.  Once I realized that this is what they were imitating (I'm a Humanities Prof and musician but not a MUSIC Professor) it made much more sense, in that not only was it great fun, but that it has a classical precedent.  Enjoy this record and go to their concerts!  My Canadian students insisted we attend, and it was great fun!

(not sure why I got on this dark night creepy crawlie kick! - must have been on a dark, wintery night in the freezing fog on a back road all alone that let my brain go there!)don't get me wrong, there are some excellent instrumental tracks, which are always my favs in TSO and I'll copy those and other non-singing favs from them onto my own CD.overall, to me it seemed a nice departure from the previous Christmas-based themes, but still magical and very well written and exceptionally played by the masterful artists that make up TSO.TSO delved into a brief NC intro during their live show, and it was very loud, overdone and almost offensive after the traditional christian-based holiday presentation mostly from their previous CD's.

I'm not trying to be mean, but your voice is shot.  I'm not sure what happened (second-hand smoke from James???).  Your voice just does not have the range and power it once did.

Her voice is also lacking range and she's all over the place changing tone, adding stuff, etc.  Really they are her songs, but she's tearing them up like a bad amateur would. This CD is also badly produced. As I read, Carly put this CD out because of the disappointing sales of her last CD and money problems.  She sued Starbucks for not properly promoting the last CD.  I can't imagine how much money she will even make from this?  Compared to what she use to earn, it has to be peanuts.  A tour would be a much wiser idea, and a lot more money MILLIONS!

Ironically, \"Never Been Gone\" has been and remains my favorite Carly song ever.

To have my favorite artist, at age 64, sing these great songs and just have a good time with them is very satisfying. I will be honest and admit that some of the silliness in some of the arrangements (\"It Happens Everyday,\" \"You're So Vain\")is unnecessary and a tiny bit distracting, but at the same time I remind myself not to take it too seriously. Carly is overwhelmingly happy to be working on this project with her children, and it shows.

The title track totally knocks me out with that sound of well-worn wisdom.  \"The silent understanding passing down from daughter to daughter, let the boys grow in the trees,\" Carly sings on an arrangement that has grown on me completely.  \"You're So Vain\" shines with this slow swaying acoustic arrangement and that classic melody, \"You said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave; but you gave away the things you loved & one of them was me.\"  The new song \"No Freedom\" swirls like an emotional storm.  \"That's the Way I Always Heard It Should Be,\" \"Anticipation\" & \"Coming Around Again\" are all great in these new sonic clothes.  \"Never Been Gone\" bears the sound of having lived in song and is glorious for the added depth.

Include Elton in that as well...but I don't feel it takes away from the songs.  Carly's passion about her music still comes through, she's willing to take chances and it sounds like the musicians are having fun and she knows her strengths and limitations.  I can tell how much I like a CD by how often I listen to it and I keep listening to \"Never Been Gone\" over and over and hear new things with each listen.

The two major disappointments here are \"It Happens Everyday\" and \"You're So Vain,\" which are both terribly flawed by hokey background vocals by Carly and others.  In \"Everyday,\" that happens to be Carly screeching something about girls packing their suitcases to live in friends' SoHo apartments.  It's like a fingernail on a chalkboard.  And her son's hokey and poor arrangement, with background vocals repeating \"give it to the girls\" is laughable and, together, these flaws ruin a song I believe is one of Carly's best from \"Hello Big Man.\"  The other real disappointment is \"You're So Vain,\" again flawed by a hokey background vocal about \"I need more cow milk.\"  Just hokey, cheap and sounding like it was recorded in a garage.  Come on, Ben and Carly, you can do much, much better! Because Carly has distinguished herself from her contemporaries and the motley crew of sleazy songstresses of today, I guess we expect more from her, which may be unfair.The new songs are good, \"Ain't No Freedom\" and \"Songbird.\"  I wonder when \"Ain't\" was wrtten.  The first part of \"Songbird\" is obviously a demo recording from '70 or '71, and the second part is Carly recording anew.  It works well.  I think the two best cuts are \"Never Been Gone,\" and \"Let the River Run.\"  Both are beautiful.  Carly's voice sounds strong and the melodies are beautiful.  \"That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be\" and \"Anticipation\" are both very good and, IMHO, more upbeat than the orginals, though I love the originals.  All in all a good album, flawed by a couple of really hokey, stupid arrangements, that stick out like sore thumbs and cast a negative influence on the entire album.  Too bad, because otherwise this could have been a four-star or even five-star IMHO.

{"text": "We were lucky to see Carly perform many of the songs from this new album in New York at Lincoln Center, Tuesday night, as part of the Grammy Museum Series.  Each song was a GEM! No one wanted the evening to end! Beginning with \"Let The River Run\" after which she received a standing ovation and ending with an oh so beautiful version of \"Coming Around Again.\"  Was there ever another way?  There were many tears in the eyes of the audience when she began to sing Coming Around Again--what a  song--this version is very emotional and Carly gave it a poignancy that only years and living life can bring.Another amazing song--actually an INCREDIBLE performance--- was \"You Belong To Me\"...  Carly was joined by John Forte (of the Fugees) on this and together the chemistry was fantastic! A whole new way of looking at this great song!  Carly performed this with John Forte on the album and on the Today show yesterday.The musicians were fabulous--you knew that as soon as they began playing--the sound was GORGEOUS-- can't think of a better word--These musicians are also with her on the album, Peter Calo, Teese Gohl, David Saw, D.J. Logic.  What a combination--Peter and Teese have been with Carly on many of her great albums and concerts(which we would love to have more of!)Part of the proceeds of this album go to the Carly Simon Music Initiative--a collaboration with the Berklee School of Music. The group concentrates on bringing the therapeutic benefits of music into the community.Great listening on this album-- a whole new way of looking at some of Carly's favorite hits.  Carly is a fascinating individual who brings intelligence to music and lyrics--this is no exception!Thank you Carly!\n", "val": 0.07405344396829605}

Now, my previous reviews of her albums reveal that I've had a vicarious crush on her for 35 years, and am NOT an unbiased reviewer. Still......What Carly has given us is a reworking of 10 of her previous songs, and two new ones. Covers? Yeah, I guess so, but these are complete new arrangements. You CAN tell old from new. Instantly. Guess what? Some of these renderings actually sound BETTER than the originals. Of course, Carly has had a lot of years to refine her art, and to decide just what she wants to convey. The two BIG HITS...\"Anticipation\" and \"You're So Vain\"...naturally had to be included, and they are. But all of them are like a first-time meeting, which I guess is the case.All-in-all, GREAT album!! If one or two of my personal favorites didn't make the cut, so what? (Personally, I would have enjoyed \"Better Not Tell Her\"). The sound/engineering is fantastic. If you're a Carly fan, of course this is a must. If not, you might want to grab \"Reflections\" along with it. Carly, I love you.

{"text": "After reading all the positive and negative reviews, I feel I have to say something that is more middle of the road. Night Castle is a great album. Like all TSO music, it is over produced. That is not a bad thing here. If you want raw TSO or Savatage music, please listen to Jon Oliva's Pain. Please remember this is not Savatage or Jon Oliva's Pain, this is TSO over wrought, over produced symphonic rock opera music. If you can accept this, then Night Castle is an awesome cd. I found you have to listen to it a couple of times before you can appreciate the music, the lyrics and the revised songs from Savatage albums. If anyone has read any of Jon Oliva's interview, Savatage died when Criss died. The music of Night Castle is a continuation where Dead Winter Dead, The Wake Of Magellan and Poets And Madmen was developing into. For those who criticize Night Castle as a rip off/reworking of Savatage, please read some of Jon Oliva's financial difficulty with the latter Savatage albums. I guess what I'm trying to say is most people have never heard of Savatage or Jon Oliva's Pain. For Jon and O'Neil to showcase classic Savatage music within TSO, it truly the best of both worlds. Financially, TSO has allow Jon to continue the earlier Savatage sound in Pain and also respecting Criss' work in Savatage. So enjoy Night Castle for what it is and if you are Savatage fans like myself, enjoy how Savatage music can cross musical barrier and create more interest in Savatage. Maybe someday Jon will be able to bring back Savatage bigger and better with a bigger folllowing. Right now we have something very special, enjoy the music of Savatage in TSO and Jon Oliva's Pain.\n", "val": 0.021176742389798164}

{"text": "First of all, for those who are upset that TSO remakes Savatage songs, you have to remember that the song that made TSO famous to begin with was a Savatage instrumental that wasn't changed at all from its original release on \"Dead Winter Dead\" and they've always thrown in a little Savatage here and there. I think it's great for people who have never heard Savatage before to become acquainted with some of their finest music and TSO has all the rights to do it because they basically are Savatage with an orchestra. It might even help people become familiar with who Savatage is and the kind of music they've done in the past. I never heard most of their music until earlier this year and I owe it all to TSO. I love hearing the Savatage stuff thrown in every once in a while, especially when it's my favorite instrumentals from the past like \"Mozart and Madness\". The new version, called \"Mozart and Memories\", has a new flavor with the different ending. So, if you don't like hearing old Savatage music redone, this CD is probably not for you.Second, if you don't like hearing music that makes you think then you probably won't like \"Night Castle\". The lyrics go with the story in the CD booklet and if you don't follow along with the story it tends to get long and convoluted. However, if you enjoy a good rock opera and like music that has meaning and a plot, you'll love \"Night Castle\". Some of the songs do tend to feel long if you don't follow the story because they're feelings and thoughts of characters in a story. So if you don't have enough patience to listen to long, meaningful songs, then this probably isn't for you either.However, that being said, if you like songs that make you feel emotion, have highs and lows like the waves of a storm, or just like to read a story with its own soundtrack, \"Night Castle\" is a great CD to have. Yes, there's 2 or 3 instrumentals that include bits of old Savatage material but they're songs that have been played live for a long time and I'm sure that if they started to play them and everyone booed then they wouldn't put them on one of their CD's. People who berate this CD are probably just looking for heart pounding rock and classical instumentals or a bunch of Christmas music. They never said that this would be a Christmas CD nor did they release it during the holiday season. I love the TSO Christmas music but it's nice to have something to listen to all year as well. Paul O'Niell and Jon Oliva are musical geniuses and it's refreshing to hear music from a group that doesn't sound like all other bands. They have great guitar work and actually have guitar solos in a lot of their music, which seems to be a forgotten art in music these days.Some people seem to have a problem with TSO putting \"Believe\", which is a song from \"Streets, A Rock Opera\", on this 2 CD set. This has also been played live many times and people seem to like it enough for them to pay tribute to Savatage by adding it to the 2nd disc. Sure, it's not as good as the original, but how many covers are ever as good as the original. Paul O'Neill said in an interview that the bonus tracks are songs that have inspired TSO so if you don't think of it as a ripoff and think of it more as a tribute then it's not so bad. All in all, this 2 CD set may not be for everyone but for people like me who enjoy music with a lot of thought provoking lyrics, great guitar work, and even a little classic Savatage thrown in, you'll love \"Night Castle\".\n", "val": 0.0021227889228612185}

What makes the guy who sings believe on this disk better than the way John sings it (which can't be touched)..Overall I am reviewing this CD based on this work -- but so much of it is stolen from Savatage that I really wonder why 5 years?  (I guess you can't steal from yourself)...The CD is pretty good with this theft aside and I do like the 'Tage feel to the whole thing -- if you are a TSO fan I think you owe yourself the chance to purchase a few savatage CD's (streets, handful of rain, and wake of magellan are good starting points).. you will see that TSO is so very close to a metal CD that you will wonder why I did not give this a chance sooner...  This is the issue with this CD - I don't think there is vocal excellence -- they are all serviceable - but not jaw dropping to say the least...The female singer is way over produced to high octave and the male singer a bit too raspy --(sounds like he smoked four packs on believe cover song)...3/5 not bad -- but not what I excpeted from these talented artists...Bring back the TAGE for 2010 -- I think you would have even more fans from the TSO success....\n", "val": 0.00011081347474828362}

{"text": "TSO is a group of exceptional musicians who's origins come from Savatage lead by John Oliva and Paul O'Neil who has been the same producer. While this latest album is not the best I've heard that TSO can do, it is a a worth CD in anyone's collection.,Unfortunately this album lacks some direction musically in a similar fashion their previous album, \"the lost Christmas Eve\", did. A main issue I have is with the group is they tent to re-hash pervious music, passing it off as something new. In some cases the result is better, and other not so much the case. Primarily this means building off songs from Savatage and re-imaging them in TSO  style. What's interesting before TSO ever existed much of its roots can be found as back as the \"The Gutter Ballet.\" This should not deter any listeners, however as many have pointed out, after five years I would think more originality would be their focus.Their trade mark song \"Christmas Eve\" was first introduced in Dead Winter Dead.Other songs:From \"The Lost Christmas Eve,\" \"Back to a Reason\" is from Poets and Madmen of the same name, although I like the recent version must better.In this Album:\"The Mountain\" -- \"Hall of the Mountain King\" from the Album of the same name.\"The Lion's Roar\" -- \"Temptation Revelation\" from the \"Gutter Ballet\", although the latter shorter version is much better... and could have been exceptional if it was kept the same.\"Believe\" -- of the same name from \"Streets a Rock Opera,\" however the vocals on the new version don't do the song justice.Listeners unfamiliar with with Savatage or John Oliva should check out the origins of the music, and from John Oliva, his set of CD's \"John Oliva's Pain,\" either may be a bit heavy handed for some's music taste, but worth a listen.\n", "val": 0.007934000343084335}

I know, I know - some may find the story formulaic, while others might fault the music for being \"prepackaged\" and a bit overproduced, but the simple fact is that the two elements are so well intertwined that it's seamless, which makes this rock opera (yes, that's what I'm calling it) not only an audible fireworks show, but a great story to read along with the music playing under it.

{"text": "What a let down. After waiting forever for the latest work by this fantastic group, Night Castle lets us down on so many levels.  No, its not Christmas music, but then Beethovan's Last Night was not either - that broke out of the pattern, and was brilliant.  The liner notes, a long and involved surrealistic tale of the Vietnam war era was limp and predictable.  The music, which is what TSO is all about, was weak and ineffectual.  With the exception of one or two cuts, this album is not worth the $.  No powerful ballads, no rousing pull you out of your seat and make you dance pieces.  A real disappointment.  Better luck next time TSO.\n", "val": 3.233632742194459e-05}

It was nice of course but I waswaiting for NC. I thought they were going to end the programbecause it was a matinee and they had to perform again butthey didn't take a break and started into some of the NCsongs and played another hour.

{"text": "I've seen a lot of negative reviews, mainly because TSO is \"revamping\" a lot of their older Savatage music, especially from Dead Winter Dead. I enjoyed the Savatage cds and loved it when TSO began including some of their music in their live concerts. They've given many of the songs new sound and meaning, and the \"older\" music fits in perfectly with the new cd.I admit at first I didn't listen to the cd. I had it on my iPod for 2 weeks and listened to bits but not the entire cd set. Then I saw them in Richmond on Nov. 5 and listened to the entire cd. I can sit outside in freezing weather and listen & not notice the weather - the music & story catch me up and for nearly 2 hours I just sit and listen. \"Believe\" should be up there on the charts, it's very moving. I've always had a \"thing\" for metal and classical together, and TSO really delivers on this one.For those who think it's a rip of their older Savatage material, I disagree. While they did redo some of the music, it fit perfectly with the story (their cd's remind me of the older Moody Blues concept albums waaaay back in the 60's & 70's) and the more I listen the more hooked I become. I drive my husband nuts playing the cds as loud as I can, but when I buy tickets to see TSO every year he demands to be one of the people I take with me, so I know he secretly likes them too. And he goes gaga in the M&G line.\n", "val": 0.012564742006361485}

{"text": "First of all, I love TSO. Their music is, for the most part, great. Hearing a real orchestra versus the electronic stuff that is most common right now is refreshing.I was really looking forward to this CD.  It started off strong. But by the end of the first disc, I was getting real tired of the never-ending ballads and the voices that sing them.  The first time I listened to it, I sat and read the liner notes that came with it. The story told is good, and the music fits the story, but the songs just go on and on and on and on. They get stuck on a run of notes and just repeat the run, with different lyrics until you want to scream at them to just get on with it. Track 13 (There Was A Life) was over 7 minutes long. That would be fine if the music was good, but not if it sounds as though they repeat the same thing over and over, just to fit the lyrics.  The instumental parts are wonderful. And if you like their music, you may like this CD, if just for the orchestration. But the vocals are what made me give it a 3. I love their other CD's with the vocals, so I don't know what it is that makes me not like this other than the fact that the ballads simply too long and repetitive.\n", "val": 0.0008012161706574261}

As usual, it features a strong spiritual element.  One single line in the text - which, I might add, is completely extraneous to the entire story and adds nothing to it - betrays the writer's Universalist worldview.

{"text": "Alright perhaps it's not fair to call \"Bad Romance\" a classic since you know, even though BOTH the verse melody and chorus are amazingly catchy, it's not necessarily going to end up as the \"be-all, end-all\" of the numerous pop tunes released over the century (a century that still has a long way to go, might I add). That won't happen because the song honestly doesn't sound significantly different from a few Britney Spears songs we no longer hear on the radio these days, which is a telling sign if you ask me. Still, what \"Bad Romance\" accomplishes is solid proof that Lady Gaga DOES have some talent. Now whether she continues to take advantage of her talent or not is still up in the air. For now however, enjoy \"Bad Romance\" to at least get some minor satisfaction in a pop song that is undeniably good.  Will it hold up over the years and be remembered though?

Both songs (Poker Face & Bad Romance) clock-in at 119 beats per minute, both are in the key of Am, both have the same producer, the \"m-m-m-ma\" of Poker Face is plainly re-worded into new (but similar) jabberwocky and placed next to the chorus as if a Poker Face cookie-cutter was all one needed to ship platinum anymore....It's clear that Gaga is a fan of movie director Alfred Hitchcock: she sings, \"I want your PSYCHO, your VERTIGO schtik, want you in my REAR WINDOW...\" I don't know if this was intentional or not -- the naming of films here by the same director seems a bit too cute to be accidental. I half expected to see THE BIRDS swoop in from NORTH BY NORTHWEST in the video, with a TORN CURTAIN thrown in for good measure.The production here is first-rate, and is a fine lead-off single for this 8-song unit between albums -- and I have little doubt the song will strike platinum -- I can think of at least a half-dozen solid ways to re-mix this; a ballad version could even be built in A minor from what I've heard here and sell strongly -- but Gaga, if you're reading this, let me tell you something: if you intend to have a career, you better drop the idea of selling the same record over and over and over.

{"text": "This is not a TSO Christmas album. It contains no Christmas music at all. It was very likely released to coincide with their annual 'Christmas' tour(s). It is my experience that the majority of TSO fans do not know the origins of TSO. TSO began as a side project of producer Paul O'Neill (along with long-time associate Bob Kinkel). Paul O'Neill is the long-time more-than-just-producer of the metal band Savatage. Savatage began as with 'former' heroin addict Jon Oliva and his brother, guitar-god Criss Oliva in the early 1980's. Tragically Criss Oliva was killed and wife seriously injured when their car was hit by a drunk driver. If one listens, these threads are still prominent in Savatage's and  TSO's CD's. TSO, arguably,found its origins from Savatage's CD \"Dead Winter Dead\", a 'rock opera' about the war in Bosnia. The instrumental piece \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" is found on both \"Dead Winter Dead\" and TSO's first CD. Since then TSO has taken on a life of it's own, overshadowing Savatage, which has since released only two CD's of new material, although individual members still release new material through their own 'side projects'. Almost all the members of Savatage continue to be involved with TSO. Savatage's well-respected guitarist Al Pitrelli is the musical director for TSO's tour shows (he has also played with bands such as Asia and Megadeth). Jon Oliva also has a considerable role in TSO. Other Savatge members/alumni that have continued to contribute their talents to TSO include Chris Caffery, Johnny Lee Middleton, Jeff Plate, Alex Skolnick, Zak Steven, and Steve 'Doc' Wacholz. Why all this history? On \"Night Castle\", TSO has recycled a significant amount of music from earlier Savatage albums. I won't tell you what. Aficionados of Savatage will recognize how TSO has well-adapted the originals, while it will all be new to those who have never heard it before. The metal heads will recognize the riff borrowed from Black Sabbath's \"Children of the Grave\". And of course, the guest appearance of Greg Lake on \"Nutrocker\" who 'originally' performed the piece as an encore on Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" from the early 1970's.\n", "val": 0.0002718439500313252}

I wanted more \"Wizards in Winter\" or \"Sarajevo\" and less of a snooze fest.They're still great in concert, but this album left me wanting.

The entire second half of the show was mostly songs off Night Castle -- songs I ended up falling in love with. Wanting more, I decided to purchase the CD immediately to try and recreate my concert experience.It's not quite the same.Let me start by saying the instrumental tracks are fantastic. Adrenaline pumping, dynamic, and creative. I could listen to some of these tracks over and over again. \"Mozart's Memories\" and \"Nutrocker\" are some of the best neo-classical renditions out there. The instrumentation is impressive as well.Unfortunately, the vocal tracks take away from everything that makes the album great. Stale lyrics and subpar singing plague about 3/4 of the set list. One of the biggest problems is that the singing is simply overdone -- almost like the vocalists are \"trying too hard,\" so to speak. After awhile, the vocal tracks all start to sound the same.The album itself doesn't have much of a \"flow\" to it. TSO could've stacked the songs better instead of having one heavy song followed by three soft ones. It causes some sections of the album to move rather slow.Longtime TSO fans, I would've been disappointed if I waited nearly five years for this album. But regardless of its shortcoming, \"Night Castle\" earns a 3/5 overall. It's worth $10 for the instrumental tracks alone but don't expect much otherwise.\n", "val": 9.320312528871e-05}

I have been a loyal TSO fan since the beginning and a Savatage fan since I discovered them in 1993. From the moment I started to open the CD package I could tell it was more Savatage rip-off. The artwork contains references to Savatage's \"Dead Winter Dead\" \"The Wake of Magellan\" and \"Streets\". Then when I listend to the CD, there was nothing that really stands out on this CD. It sounds exactly the same as the others (except Beethoven's last Night) which is by far the most unique and best. And again on this CD they STEAL Savatage music. Track 7 - \"Mozart And Memories\" IS NOT A TSO SONG!!! This is a Savatage song from \"Dead Winter Dead\" called \"Mozart and Madness.\" It is EXACTLY the same, except the added a SHORT little extension to the end. No credit or reference to the Savatage album is given.  And then they flat out place a Savatage song from the \"Streets\" album on here - track 23 - \"Believe\". They give credit to Savatage for this one. But WHY put this on here?  It sounds EXACTLY like the original studio recording!!!  They have a different singer do the vocals but he tries to sound and sing like Jon Oliva (but doesn't pull it off). Savatage have re-recorded this song several times and have more interesting versions. There is no reason to put this on here. At least they should have changed it and made it sound like a TSO version.  So overall this CD is a big dissapointment. TSO is clearly running out of ideas. I think it is about time they hang it up.\n", "val": 7.608171290485188e-05}

There is no way you could convince me that the strings on the album were studio recorded, something I would expect from the a band that hires out an orchestra at every concert!  Then the songs, so incredibly repetitive that they bore me and I find myself skipping ahead in the album.  The vocalists sound like they are trying to bring emotion into these emotionless songs so I can't fault them for making the attempt.  About half the songs sound like I've heard them before.The whole thing just seems like it was rushed through but we've been waiting for 5 years for this.

{"text": "After fully listening to both discs , despite the large volume of music, I still was left feeling somehow \"shorted\" by this album. First off, almost one third of this material is either directly stolen from the Savatage back-catalogue or rehashed versions of previous TSO riffs. Secondly, I felt the vocals on this seemed emotionally \"forced\" and uninspired, I was almost literally inadvertantly laughing at some of the forced emotional \"cheesiness\" in the lyrics and the vocal performances.While TSO has never put out a \"bad\" album , I would definitely rank this dead last in their discography. My personal favorite is their very underrated \" Beethoven's Last Night\" which I thought was their most original, cohesive, and emotionally compelling album to date.This \"Night Castle\" while not entirely without merit, leaves the listener a bit disappointed, especially given the long wait between this and their last album one would hope they could have been a bit more creative than this.By the way, I am not just a casual TSO listener, but a long time \"metal-head\" that has followed this band since it's inception as Savatage in the mid 80s through their metamorphosis into TSO and to the present day.I think the reviewers giving this 5 stars are not being honest with themselves and certainly not being honest with you, the reader, who is coming on here looking for an objective review.\"Beethoven's Last Night\" and the original \"Christmas Eve\" are their true 5 star albums, \"Night Castle\" pales in comparison to the creativity, emotional sincerity, and cohesiveness of those two albums.To sum up, you've basically heard everything on here done before, and done better the first time around.p.s.

The way he weaves them in is simply brilliant.  The musicians, let once again by Al Pitrelli, have recreated the sound we love, and the singers provide an amazing narration of a wonderful story.  Having Jeff Scot Soto sing on this record was one of the greatest surprises.Honestly, I can't believe there are any bad reviews of Night Castle.  Seriously, don't give them any credit.

The music was a disappointment.They even threw in a Holiday track \"Nutrocker\" with Greg Lake of ELP on bass, but even this only served to remind the listener of earlier, better TSO music.There was hardly any \"O\" in this TSO.  There were a few tracks that featured some orchestral touches, but most of the other tracks were overwrought numbers with medicore vocalists and repetitive lyrics.  Reading the storyline helped a bit, but this release continued the trend (for me at least) that every TSO release is less impressive than the one before.  \"Christmas Eve\" is a classic, and everything since has been a step down...\n", "val": 7.026423554634675e-05}

Paul O'Neill and TSO have taken this a step further and simply started rerecording songs from their past and giving them new titles.  Why do I need a remake of Prelude to Madness, Temptation Revelation, Mozart and Madness and Believe?  Worst of all, the credits on the songs are wrong.  Believe from Savatage's album Streets is credited just to Paul O'Neill, not to Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva and Paul O'Neill as it was in 1991.  This isn't the first time this has happened either, every time a Savatage song from the O'Neill era is re-released, Criss and Jon's name start disappearing from the credits!  Not only is this immoral, it is actually illegal.O'Neill has't had an original idea in almost a decade.  So when the album isn't recycled Savatage songs it simply third rate Broadway Heavy Metal.You want a Savatage record?  Go by Jon Oliva's Pain.  You want a rock opera?

{"text": "After hearing this CD I can now say I see exactly what the problem people are having with it is. TSO sounds like a band now, and not an orchestra with vocals. And when you compare Night Castle to their previous releases it could be considered an insult. I mean full front electric guitars and drums? Prog-metal riffs? This is practically a welcoming back of Savatage. Almost. And while progression for bands is usually a good thing TSO are not a band parse. However, putting all that aside for a moment, Night Castle is actually a very enjoyable piece of music. A bit overblown perhaps (and disconnected for what is supposedly an intricate concept CD), but it's still plain from the beginning that a great deal of time and effort was put into its making. Individually each and every song is unique and compelling and both disks will hold your full attention if you are willing to let them. You just have to overlook the change of sound and style. Fans of Christmas music will have to look elsewhere though, as well as those looking for that classic relaxing orchestration feel. We have to remember Jon Oliva's a metal-man at heart and it defiantly shows here! Basically, I think if this CD was released by anyone other than Trans-Siberian Orchestra it would be getting much better reviews.

{"text": "Like many other TSO fans here I was disappointed with Night Castle.  In fact, I wanted to turn it off halfway through the first disk and never listen to it again.  With this album TSO appears to have devolved completely into a boring, contrived, generic rock-opera band only capable of playing 80's power ballads.  Is this Savatage?  I don't know, I never heard them.  But gone is the charm of the Christmas albums, the mix and variety of singing and musical styles.  The songs on Night Castle sound almost the same throughout.  And if they use more than 2 or 3 singers I can't tell the difference.  The only memorable songs whatsoever are the last 3 on the second disk, bonus tracks that aren't part of the rock opera.It's okay to be a TSO fan and not like this album.

{"text": "Where to begin?TSO has been a vital and important part of our annual Christmas celebration since my children were small. Either playing in the background or bringing down the walls, the orchestra has become to us what Bing Crosby was to my parent's generation.It has always been a shame that the Christmas songs of TSO did not play so well the remainder of the year.  Christmas Canon Rock somehow lost its magic in the sweltering heat of summer.That has just changed. After five years in the making, Night castle is TSO's attempt to bring its sound and poetry to old and new fans and to do it without the usual seasonal charm.I should learn not to underestimate this group of writers and musicians. Every time that I do the result is a pleasant surprise. Night Castle is no exception.In one word, it is brilliant. Night Castle is a throwback to the grand rock operas of the 1970s but still moves steadily onward with the trademark TSO mix of guitar driven rock and orchestral movements.The story behind the CD's theme reads like a good book. It is impossible to put down.I'm sure that there are some who will not like Night Castle. Fans of TSO or music with blazing guitars will not be disappointed.My only advice is to skip the mp3 download and buy the CD. It is worth it - 2CDs for $9.99. If not for any other reason, you get extra songs including one titled \"Nutrocker.\" Everybody can use a little Nutrocker in their lives.If you must have the downloaded version, you can go on the TSO website and read the CD's full story from start to finish. Pretty damn cool of the band to this, if you ask me.\n", "val": 0.018446579575538635}
{"text": "Unlike a lot of other TSO fans, I actually didn't even know that this album was in development until about a year ago, so I may be immune to some of the effects that those who have been anticipating Night Castle since it was announced are experiencing.  After such a long wait, it's pretty much impossible to not have unrealistically high expectations.  Also, I knew it was not a Christmas album, so I also had no disappointments on that level either.Personally, I think the album is very good.  The musical style is overall very similar to TSOs past elements, though the album overall has a bit of a darker tone due to the subject matter, which I actually like.  The song-writing is great and the best songs of Night Castle are strong enough to stand with the best songs off of any of their other albums.  There are many standout tracks, including Night Enchanted, The Mountain, Night Castle, Mozart and Memories, Another Way You Can Die, The Lion's Roar, Moonlight and Madness, Child of the Night, and Tracers.  For those who have heard the album, one thing will be clear:  The majority of my favorite songs are instrumentals.With that said, there is one criticism that I have seen over and over, and I can confirm that it's true:  The album is over-produced.  On far too many tracks--and as a whole--the guitars especially don't come blasting at you with the same sort of power that they do on other albums.  If you listen to Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24 then you think to yourself, \"Man, this guys are really rocking out!\"  That's not the case on Night Castle.  Too often the guitars seem sort of impotent, to be honest.  The album all over sounds too clean . . . too polished . . . too perfect.But you have to take the good with the bad.  Don't take my criticisms to mean that the album is not worth buying, because it is.  I gave it 4 stars, after all.  (Truthfully, I would probably give it 3 1/2 but since you can't do 1/2 star ratings, I rounded up since it's TSO.)

{"text": "Well, I have heard this was a rerun...by TSO.Hardly!!!Owning 4 of their albums, having gone to their concert 4 times....I'm happy to say, this is no rerun, but original songs, done in the flavor that has made them famous. There is some songs that are reminiscent of Beethoven's last night, but no repeats from that album. Also there are some songs from their concerts that have not previously made it to their albums. A few, I was really hoping to get.TSO is either powerful, boisterous and fun or poignant and thought provoking, but never disappointing.Rock On TSO!If you are interesting in my opinion by song:01 - Night Enchanted:  an exuberant beginning in the theatrical form, we all associate with TSO. A changing tempo and several transitions that make it unique.02 - Childhood Dreams: Wonderful melody and crooning voice rock you in this pleasant  powerful song.03 - Sparks: A true TSO song with a boisterous and powerful voice belting out the song. You feel like raising your fist and smiling at the key points in the song.04 - The Mountain: Growling, drum beat beginning to a frenetic mad pace. A free for all guitar and drum fest.05 - Night Castle: A throbbing refrain, with a pleading deep male voice seeking escape.  A true TSO gem in its theatrics and depth.06 - The Safest Way Into Tomorrow: A bold a powerful melody with a strong male lead. Great song and one of my personal favorites.07 - Mozart And Memories: Sneaky quiet start with a jolt of powerful guitar lead-ins with a meld of rock and classical sounds.08 - Another Way You Can Die: A bit different than, I know TSO for, it reminds me a bit of Aerosmith's \"Walk this way\" at the start. Once again the strong male voice dominates as well as the strong guitar sound.09 - Toccata - Carpimus Noctem: Quite a mix from the classical beginning to the rolling guitars and pounding drums ending with a helicopter.10 - The Lion's Roar: A trumpet weaving you into a drumbeat of guitars, keyboard and more guitars.11 - Dreams We Conceive: A striking ballad with a pleading voice and guitars following along.12 - Mother And Son: An Asian conversation (I think) is this whole song along with street sounds. no idea what is being said.  \"Yeah man, gonna hit road...\"sounds like what is said in English.13 - There Was A Life:  A pensive plaintive beginning reminiscent of Beethoven's last night. A ballad of questions. Another powerful great song. Another favorite.14 - Moonlight And Madness: A crazed piano start with guitars following, reminiscent of some classical favorites. A duet of guitar and piano....I have heard a similar tune during their concerts.15 - Time Floats On: Another ballad, less plaintive and more pensive.16 - Epiphany:  A helicopter at the start of this. Throbbing guitars and a wonderful melodic ballad and the type of meandering thoughts TSO is known for. From the fear of the night, to realizing childhood is long past. \"Somewhere\" is the refrain... This song goes into a melody familiar to all that loved the Lost Christmas Eve album.  At the 5:45 minute mark, it has the same melody as the What Child is this does at the 2:45 minute mark. Different words, but similar sound. (On this night...). Earlier, I incorrected stated it was from the Beethoven's Last night album...Whoops.17 - Bach Lullaby: A quiet little music box theme.18 - Father, Son & Holy Ghost: A lilting melody with one of the accomplished TSO soproanos. Tentative and poignant, until it gets a bite and then it growls with the usual full octane sound.19 - Remnants Of A Lullaby: Guitar strumming starts this light tune. You can hear the smile in the singer's voice. It is a nice very upbeat tune.20 - The Safest Way Into Tomorrow [Reprise]: A quick reprise of the longer more involved version, heard earlier in this album.21 - Embers: A light guitar strumming a quick tune. Reminds me a bit of Cat Steven's Peace Train.22 - Child Of The Night: Orchestral sounds start this piece and the highest female voices possible singing in unison (ala Wizard of Oz). All innocence and sweetness.23 - Believe: Love this guy's voice, a raspy edge as he pours out his heart and sings a ballad of listening and support. Love this song.24 - Nutrocker: Definitely from the concert, kicky, flashy and full of life...Exuberant and fun. Even includes the Snoopy song. You can see they are enjoying passing the baton back and forth.25 - Carmina Burana: The opera sopranos from the concert, I have been waiting to get this in an album....Finally.  It's a family favorite.  Picture multiple sopranos singing in unison and the music punctuated by light, very dark foreboding and wonderful.26 - Tracers: Pounding drums and guitar, working to a crescendo...It is a conversation of music. This is the one they raise on the lifts with the flames to... You get the musical pause as they set up the lifts.27 - The Flight of Cassandra (Amazon MP3 Exclusive): A guitar and piano piece rolling one into the other. You can almost see the stage antics that would accompany this.\n", "val": 0.09043970704078674}

I never considered Jon Oliva a great vocalist, but his execution of that song on \"Streets\" was pretty much perfect.  Why fix what ain't broken?The vocals and vocal melodies are so bland, they feel like generated by a computer.  I really don't like all these voices filled with fake emotions.

If you like TSO for terribly cheesy and uninspired vocalists, I firmly believe this is their best album (hehehe).  The cd has about 9 or 10 kickin' instrumentals (way more than any of the others), and two or three great rocking songs.  The rest is far too disney/broadway.Pros: Great instrumentals and lead work.  Great compositions.Cons: The singing is absolutely corny.  They do a terrible job at ripping some Savatage (Lion's Roar, Mountain, Another Way You Can Die, Believe, and possibly some more that i passed over).I have to admit that as a TSO fan, I am purely a fan of the instrumentals and musicians, like Al Pitrelli, Chris Caffery, Alex Skolnick, Jon Oliva, Paul O'Niel, Jonny Lee Middleton, and Jeff Plate. I cannot stand the singers, I just don't understand why they did not try to use much more poignant singers like Zak Stevens and Jon Oliva.\n", "val": 0.015810342505574226}
{"text": "When you stop to wonder why this album took so long to be completed, it's obvious that Jon Oliva and Paul O'Neill took a lot of time and care to be sure this album reflected the styles of Savatage and most importantly, the late Criss Oliva.  Any TSO or Savatage fan will appreciate it, and as an avid TSO and Savatage fan I feel like I'm listening to \"Gutter Ballet\" when I hear \"Tracers\". I know that Criss would be very proud of the many tributes to him throughout the album, and Savatage fans will take note of the fact that \"The Mountain\" is an updated version of Criss Oliva's instrumental song \"Prelude To Madness\" from the \"Hall of the Mountain King' album, where the guitarists match Criss's style perfectly. The fans will also notice how closely \"Another Way You Can Die\" resembles \"Complaint In The System\" from Savatage's \"Wake of Magellan\" album, as Jeff Scott Soto perfectly matches the pitch of former Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens. And let's not forget about \"Believe\", written by Criss Oliva himself for Savatage's \"Streets\" album; what a brilliant idea to include this updated version on Night Castle. You will feel like you are back in the beginning of this incredible journey that the Oliva brothers started for us, and you might even have chills or tears in your eyes while listening to this album. Night Castle is truly a masterpiece to be proud of, and I can't wait to hear the songs performed live. Still the orchestra plays...\n", "val": 0.04466983303427696}

{"text": "I can truthfully say that the word \"overcooked\" may best describe \"NightCastle\".  It sounds more or less like every Savatage album ever released, and just doesn't sparkle. It feels as though it was produced to death.Still, the musicianship is undeniable and like nothing else out there.  The pace is a bit ponderous, probably due to the plodding rhythm on several of the pieces. The guitar tones are insanely good.Hopefully, it will at least encourage some different songs in the live performances.  The last few tours have been so predictable that I am surprised that the audience doesn't shout the titles before the song starts.Having said all this, TSO is still one of the bright spots of the holiday every year, and even middling new material is welcome here.\n", "val": 0.0006301740650087595}
{"text": "Like many metal fans, my TSO fandom is deeply rooted in their association to the criminally underrated band Savatage.  TSO is the remaining Savatage members, the producer/main songwriter, Paul O'Neill, along with a bunch of additional musicians and of course, an orchestra.  The music and story concepts are basically in the same vein as they were in Savatage, but a bit more orchestral with the metal toned down a bit.  Basically TSO is Savatage-lite.  Paul O'Neill basically started TSO on a kind of whim in order to deliver a holiday themed album based on the success of a Savatage song.  While a very musically talented group, it always seemed like a halfassed project that got lucky(Jon Oliva has even said himself that he does this band to basically pay the bills.  His role anymore in TSO is basically just playing keyboards).  Now, Paul devotes all his time to TSO and basically left Savatage to more or less fade away to a footnote in heavy metal history.  Doesn't seem quite fair, but at least Savatage lives on to a certain degree.  TSO has always been looked at as a seasonal kind of event, an annual tradition to take the family to when they swing through your hometown.  So, TSO has been a holiday household name ever since.  I'm not sure how well Beethoven's Last Night sold, but it was very refreshing to see a TSO album on the shelves that wasn't Christmas themed.  Not that I have anything against the Christmas albums, but who throws The Christmas Attic in their cd player in mid July?  It was cool to see TSO become a band that wasn't strictly associated with one specific time of the year.That brings us to Night Castle, an album which has been in the works for what seems like 800 years now(they played songs from it when I saw them in 2004!).  All this anticipation will undoubtedly create high expectations, which is kind of a curse coz you really can't live up to it(Phantom Menace anyone?).Well, Night Castle's sound is what you pretty much expect it to be.  But honestly, I find myself getting kinda bored of it after awhile.  I love orchestral and progressive rock/metal, but there's too much of a sameness to this.  The story isn't bad, but it's a little lacking, especially when compared to O'Neill's previous stories. I can't honestly say it's bad musically-it's actually very good-it's just a bit monotonous, not much variance at all.  It's missing something.  Also, as many have said before, a bunch of Savatage tunes are used here as well, mostly instrumental.  I suppose I don't have too much of an issue with this, after all they are O'Neill's songs, but it just seems a bit cheap to fill space with songs that have been done before, especially for an album that has been in the works this long.  This is a bit irritating to me on Disc 2 with the bonus track, \"Believe\", one of the most cherished of Savatage songs from the album Streets.  I'm not sure why this was done at all coz most would agree that you simply cannot touch that song.  As far as \"Believe\" goes, Savatage vocalist Jon Oliva is what made a great song a friggin phenomenal and unforgettable song.  Oliva's performance will damn near make your eyes tear up.  No disrespect to vocalist Tim Hockenberry, who does the TSO version, but he just doesn't hold a candle to Oliva.  It actually sounds alot like Joe Cocker singing \"Believe\".  TSO's vocalists have never been all that great.  Not bad singers by any means(at least they sing, a rare thing anymore), but they've always sounded(to me anyway) like weaker and clumsier versions of Zak Stevens.In all honesty, it seriously pains me to have to say anything negative about this album, especially considering that in today's music mainstream, \"music\" is more or less a four letter word.  But on the other hand, because of this rarity and also my fandom, I can't just simply give the album nothing but praise and say it's a masterpiece.  That wouldn't be honest.  And yes, there are good songs to be found here.  I'm not giving up on this band, and I'll continue to support them.Paul O'Neill was really onto something with Savatage.  There was some real magic there, and I can only hope that in the future Paul will be able to tap back into that.\n", "val": 0.00039386970456689596}
{"text": "First off, the lettering on the CD cover \"Night Castle\" is just ametuerish. It really does look like some old 80's metal band or something. I know that has nothing to do with the sound of this, but I just had to get that off my chest for the 2 people who read my review.On to the music...There's a few good songs on here...but my main problem with TSO is that they are SO rediculously repeditive! Once you hear a riff or melody, you know that 99.999% of the time you will be hearing that same riff be repeated 4 more times. Apply that to a 5 minute song, and it gets old...real fast. Then keep in mind you have 2 CD's worth of repeditive riffing...and not only does the CD get boring, it gets unlistenable after 15 minutes. Night Enchanted is a good song the first listen...but after a few replays, it's so monotonous.The best song on here WOULD be \"The Mountain\" but they've totally watered this version down to meet mainstream listeners now. I think the reason Sarejevo was so popular, was because it took a classic and really put attitude into it. Same with the orginial Hall of the Mountain king song....but this version? Ugh...so watered down. Yes, I get that TSO is meant to cater to old grannies and families, but still...their sound is just predictable and repeditive now.There's some good vocals here. I really do have a thing for broadway sound...so I don't TOTALLY hate this albumn. Still...the repetition is just overkill. I stopped buying their Xmas cd's after 2 of them because it wasn't clear they were evolving or growing in any way, so I thought this would be some...enlightening...nope! I was never even that into Beethoven's last night either. It certainly had it's moments, but the chords these guys use are always the same.Another letdown is O Fortuna. That sound would totally rock if done right, but they really manage to keep the passion at low levels. Even the original song has more power that this!All in all, I will probably play this never after this week. TSO really takes the great idea of fusing classical and metal...only it falls flat with no attitude or originality. They don't add their own take on the songs...just change them for the worse. I do like the vocals, but the music...just...blah. Other bands like Nightwish has perfected the art of classical/metal...and it sounds so great because it's original and complex. The music here just sounds simple.\n", "val": 6.678330100839958e-05}

{"text": "Trans-Siberian Orchestra is one of those musical \"event bands\" that reaches across many demographics. The Christmassy, feel good, classical motifs make the music palatable to a wide range of audiences - many of whom know nothing of the band's origins. There's nothing wrong with that broad success, and fans should be reassured that \"Night Castle\" is consistent in sound and content with the kinds of work that has made TSO a household name.What many of those listeners don't realize however, is that much of TSO's music is rooted in the dark, melodious heavy metal music of the band, \"Savatage\", and \"Night Castle\", more than any previous TSO album, borrows heavily from the original band's discography. That's right; there are multiple references to Savatage's work, mostly instrumentals going back as far as \"Hall of the Mountain King\". As a long time Savatage fan, it warms my Warrior's heart that soccer moms and church grannies are sitting in their living rooms rocking out to riffs from \"Hall of the Mountain King\" and \"Gutter Ballet\" - music they'd probably condemn if heard in its original context.For the most part, this works on the new album, bringing some powerful and familiar content together with new work that is, in varying degrees, equally successful. Some of the new instrumentals are as good as any classic TSO or Savatage, but with a few exceptions, the vocal pieces just don't quite seem as magical as those on the first few albums. Maybe it's too much of a good thing. One of those exceptions is \"Another Way to Die,\" which sounds like a missing track from \"Edge of Thorns\" or \"Dead Winter Dead\" and \"Time Floats On\" which could easily have been pulled from \"Wake of Magellan\". I mean that in a resoundingly good way.One vocal that cannot go unmentioned (which is also part of the Savatage legacy) is the track titled, \"Believe\" on the 2nd disc. This is a deeply spiritual, heartfelt, and powerful song, which deserves to be heard and appreciated by an audience as wide as TSO's. However, it's a tragedy that the version here is not the original Savatage recording featuring Jon Oliva's impassioned vocals. While this version is acceptable in a \"gravelly Broadway musical\" kind of way, it pales when compared to Jon's original work. Anyone who likes the song here but is unfamiliar with the original should purchase and listen to it on Savatage's \"Streets\" album, which is filled with many comparable masterworks - though edging slightly more toward rock/metal than TSO's orchestrally and socially sanitized work. \"Streets\" is an album of despair, hope, and redemption, with songs so perfectly executed no re-imagining will ever compare.All in all, this is a quality addition to any Savatage and/or TSO collection. The strength of the instrumentals and several of the vocals makes it a fine fit in either library. Its greatest fault is that it references some superior works, and rather than expanding TSO's horizons, just whets the appetite for more from Jon and Savatage.\n", "val": 0.031182443723082542}

My favorites by far are their Christmas albums, I listen to them year-round and refuse to classify them as holiday music.  They're simply too good to limit them to one month a year.I picked up the album the day it dropped and listened to it immediately, my first impression was that it wasn't too bad, I don't think it was worth the wait but I enjoyed it.  At this point, I have listened to it daily, and I am certain that it will be on my TSO rotation at work.I did not typically enjoy songs with vocals but a couple stood out, \"Child of the Night\" and \"Sparks\" in particular, \"Night Castle\" was also a good one.  As a whole though, I have found that my preference is for their instrumentals, and this album certainly did not disappoint.  \"Tocatta\" and \"Moonlight and Madness\" are good enough to make me stop what I am doing and just listen, much like \"Sarajeveo 12/24\" and \"Queen of the Winter Night.\"It was frustrating at times to catch musical remakes from previous albums, I would have enjoyed listening to the album and not inserting word from Lost Christmas Eve or BLN.  I also felt that the vocals were simply being sung.  In the past you believe that the people singing are actually feeling the emotions that their voices are projecting.As a whole, I will enjoy it and continue to listen to it but I imagine it will become something closer to BLN, an album I don't listen to as frequently.

While it may not be my favorite TSO album (That probably goes to a tie between Christmas Eve and Other Stories and Beethoven's Last night.) I do find myself listening to it A LOT. I'm already on probably my second listen of the entire album since I got the CD. I think the music is well done.I do notice one thing about this album and that is that it is has a slightly lower tempo than say BTN. What I mean by that is that all of the vocal songs are slowish ballads. Now I have no problem with this, but i think I was expecting a slightly heavier album in terms of tempo from the five tracks on the albums website. Speaking of those five tracks (Sparks, Toccata, The Lion's Roar, Dreams We Conceive, and Moonlight and Madness)  I feel that those are the real standouts of the album. Thats not to say that I'll be skipping songs when i listen to this album.One more very small negitive with this album also goes with the ending of the \"Rock Opera\" (tracks 1-21) I enjoy it ALOT but I do feel that it kindof goes out on a whimper. I was expecting a bit more of a climax musically than what is given. However after reading the overly humungious 68 page NOVEL that goes with this CD I see that the climax actually comes during Father Son and Holy Ghost, in that the soldiers wife finally finds out what happens. I don't want to give much away. Also I think the addition of the Bonus tracks, while they are cool tracks and real concert standouts (Carmina Burana, and Tracers). I think they take away from some of the emotional punch of the album.If your still wondering why I'm giving this album four stars, its because I really enjoy the musicality of the album (even if it is a little over produced in spots), and I won't be skipping tracks when I listen to it.\n", "val": 0.00027902270085178316}

{"text": "Trans-Siberian Orchestra's latest release, \"Night Castle,\" has been highly anticipated by TSO fans for years now. Almost a decade since \"Beethoven's Last Night\" (their last non-Christmas release) and five years after their last new album (2004's \"The Lost Christmas Eve\"), the band has been playing tracks - usually their interpretation of \"Carmina Burana\" - from this album for the past several years during their winter tour shows.Now that the album's out, I personally found it to be nothing special. It reminded me a lot of the rather forgettable \"The Christmas Attic\" album that came out in 1998 - while not bad, you knew it could have been better. Constructed as a concept album a la \"Beethoven's Last Night\" or \"Christmas Eve and Other Stories,\" the story, while moving and powerful as read in the liner notes, does not come through well in the music.The addition of four \"Bonus Tracks\" at the end of disc 2 also completely ruins the mood, and the track \"Nutrocker\" reeks of holiday music; ironically, this may be the best instrumental track on the album and serves as a glaring reminder that what you were expecting was not what you got. Even the tracks they had been previewing at their concerts sound stripped-down here; \"Carmina Burana\" is laden with mediocre choirs vocals backed up by a drum, a bass and a guitar, completely not doing justice to one of the most epic works ever penned.The music also moves away from TSO's roots, relying more on lyrics, but this unfortunately comes at the expense of instrumental quality more times than not - I swore I heard MIDI in the background of some songs. The tracklist lacks the punch of a \"Christmas Eve Sarajevo\" or \"What is Eternal?\" kind of moment. There are some quality tracks, to be sure, but none that really that knock you off your feet.At $3.99 for an MP3 download and $7.99 for the actual CD, it's not a bad buy at all, but it's not at the level of TSO's other works. After five years and awesome live performances, I was hoping for much better.\n", "val": 3.836505493381992e-05}
{"text": "Wow, where to start...Being a long time Savatage fan this is vindication that Savatage should have sold millions or albums and been one of the biggest bands ever. TSO is still Savatage (check the liner notes--they're all there), but on a much grander scale.  Every song grabs you and throws you a reminder of past Savatage triumphs.  If you are not a Savatage fan and only know them as TSO, you will still love this album, but for the long time fan you'll get chills almost every song.  I know that doesn't sound too metal, but Savatage was always different. The band you loved that no one else knew about.  And now, the world knows their greatness.Ok, back to Night Castle:  First, what a deal--$7.99 for 26 songs and the packaging is top notch.  Second, its NOT a Christmas album.  Third, every song is a masterpiece filled with everything you expect of TSO.  This is their opus.Standout tracks:  Night Enchanted, The Safest Way Into Tomorrow, Dreams We Conceive, Epiphany,and the highlight:  BelieveIf you've never heard of Savatage check out the albums:  Hall of the Mountain King, Gutter Ballet, Streets, The Wake of Magellan & Dead Winter Dead--you'll hear the origins of TSO and Night Castle will take on a whole new dimension.\n", "val": 0.02948199212551117}
{"text": "Whenever asked what my favorite bands are, TSO is always mentioned in the top five. No one paints a picture with sounds and words quite like this group.. And frankly, I am surprised that music this good is received as well as it is in a world over run with kiddie rock and alternative boy bands. However, it doesn't matter how good a disc is, there will always be some critical people who will tear it to shreds in a very poorly written and misguiding review. After reading reviews for this album where uninformed listeners report that their seventeen year old son could have written Night Castle in his basement with a lap top, a guitar and some drums.. And other individuals babbling about MIDI's and vocals that didn't go with the music.. I didn't know what to expect from my first listen. But in the end, all I can say is that this album is wonderful. It is TSO doing what TSO does best, and if you like their trade mark sound and enjoyed the harder edged material of \"The Lost Christmas Eve,\" then you will be right at home with this cd. The lyrics are thought provoking and the music soul touching, as it is with all of this bands music. I think I even enjoyed this one a bit more than Beethoven's Last Night. The melodies here are richer and reflect the more memorable side of TSO music. The first two songs are a little weaker than the others. But the cd soon explodes into a sonic soundscape that enfolds the listener in its heartfelt magic. As usual, Trans Siberian Orchestra delivers a winner. And if there's a seventeen year old out there who can compose such fantastic music with limited tools in a basement, then that kid needs to be on America's Got Talent, or some other such show. But I don't think such a feat could be pulled off by any youth of our time.. unless he or she be a child prodigy. So ignore the nay sayers on this one folks. If you have enjoyed all of the offerings by this band thus far, this one will be no different in the sure to please department. Enter now the yawning doors of the Night Castle, and be taken on a musical journey that no other band can take you on.\n", "val": 0.011646048165857792}

{"text": "Great:It's been nearly 10 years since TSO's last non-Christmas effort, Beethoven's Last Night. While completely bombastic, over the top, and bordering on ridiculous, it was a great and very original take on a story involving a key figure in musical history. The arrangments (vocal and instrumental) were solid as was the majority of the song witing and the performances.I love TSO. Must make that clear, I directed live performances of two of their albums (Xmas Eve & Beethoven's Last Night) when I was in college and have studied them and their music in depth for over a decade. They have always had an unparalleled ability to instill beauty, magic, and tenderness in their music and truly captivate their audiences.Now in 2009, we have Night-Castle. A double disc, 28-song epic. The question is however, does it truly reflect 5 years of work and the need for the constant delays.The instrumentals, as TSO is famous for, are certainly the perk of the album. Leading numbers being Midnight & Madness, The Lion's Roar, Tracers, and Flight of Cassandra (possibly one of their most versatile and best) and Nutrocker.My heart jumped when I saw the title \"The Mountain\" as I thought, my god, maybe finally a metal-version of Night on Bald Mountain. No luck, unortunately it was merely an underperformed, uninspired, rehashing of Savatage's cover of \"Hall of the Mountain King\"The treatment of Verdi's \"Requiem\" re-titled \"Night Enchanted\" is solid and has a truly kicking opening but at about a minute in, gives way to completely over produced vocals (female mainly) and is a bit repetitive and over-produced. The lowest point of the instrumentals is possibly the shameless borrowing of Savatage's \"Mozart & Madness\". Now cleverly (not) titled \"Mozart and Memories\" it is so unneccessary that it borders on insulting to Savatage fans. I do respect that they may want to introduce fans to the music of Savatage and Mozart and Madness was a great track but its place was on Dead Winter Dead, not here.While the instrumentals are strong, some absorb track time by overly repetitive riffs, immensely exaggerated ritardanos and diminuendo and few have any shred of modulation or creative tempo change.The vocal songs are packed full of musical emotion albiet they are really just over-the-top ballads pounding I,vi,IV,V for up to ten minutes (see Epiphany & There was a Life) The vocalists sound unmotivated and do not at all refelct the immense emotion heard on previous TSO albums. Most open with a standard 8-16 bar piano progression. Oliva, Kinkell, and O'Neill certainly have an undoubtable knack for these openings as they always \"twinkle\" in a sense and bring about that \"magical (Christmas?) feelings and provide for a delightful listening experience.I was very happy at the lack of filler tracks (only 2 tracks under a minute) but between the amount of borrowed material, the mechanicaly-perfect sounds, and the computer-sounding choral vocals they should just focus on writing and continuing to be as original as possible, not over producing and perfecting everything beyond acceptable reality. With all of the formulaic, fake, and repetitive garbage in mainstream music, it is pertinent for a group such as TSO, who bring something so unique and new to modern Rock and Classical, to keep as much of their material as original and unique as possible.As always, the musicians are top notch, the arrangments are masterful but the this is certainly far from their best effort. I do however have complete faith that as TSO continues to strive for new musical heights and directions (thank god they're laying off the dead-horse that was Christmas) they will certainly continue to broaden their audience and hopefully continue to bring us solid classical/classic rock/metal influences music for years!\n", "val": 0.00024073522945400327}
{"text": "First off, I have been a long time Savatage and TSO fan.  I own all Savatage (post-Criss) and TSO CDs and listen regularly, most of the time weekly, and continue to love everything they had done.  When I first heard TSO many years ago, I was hooked instantly.  They had finally captured all of the progressive sound of Savatage and pushed it as close to mainstream as they could get it.  I have seen many TSO shows, traveling many miles to many cities just to see their matchless performances.  I follow the music of many of TSO members, Al Pitrelli, Jane Mangini, Jon Oliva, Chris Caffery.Now that I have laid out my defense for being pro TSO & Savatage, here's the bad news.  My first impression: What the heck is this?  My later impression: What the heck is this?  I do not recall being this disappointed about a music release in the last decade (at least).  As other reviewers have indicated, this is way over produced.  Beyond that, the cheap electronic sounds and the overuse of the sustained guitars are enough to make me scream.  Then there's the vocals - ugh, the vocals.  Where did they get these singers, and where did they get the engineers that mastered the vocal tracks?  Most of the music is no better than my 17 year old son can create with his synth and guitar rig in the basement recording/mastering on the laptop with \"FruityLoops\" FLStudio software.  And is that actually MIDI in some of the songs?Underneath it all, I can still see some good song writing, which lets me know there are some of the original brain cells still alive in there somewhere.  They just failed to deliver, especially for a project they claim to have been sober enough to work on since 2003!  As another reviewer said so well: it was a good 10 year run.I almost feel guilty, like I am betraying my close friends that have lived in my CD player for years, and who I have visited in person in the front row each year.  It's time now for the next musical geniuses to create the next new sound and pick up where TSO left off.  R.I.P. TSO, you will always be remembered and loved for creating something amazing.  Now it's just a lame Broadway / cheese-rock mix that I just cannot handle.\n", "val": 8.03434377303347e-05}
{"text": "I normally like to wait a day or two to give an album several spins before forming a judgment on its quality. There are times though when you can tell from the get go how you'll feel about a work, especially if it's a band you have a long history with and many hours of listening pleasure to your credit. This being said this is TSO's least impressive album to date. The long wait time in between their albums makes this sad fact all the more disheartening. When I first heard that this album was FINALLY going to actually be released, I was very excited. And let's face it, it's been almost 10 years since BLN, and nearly as long since \"Poet's and Madmen\" (Savatage) and their last gasp of anything but Christmas music. And it's been a while since the conclusion of their trilogy as well, so TSO/Savatage fans have to be a patient bunch. Now the fact that this is their worst album doesn't mean it's a bad album. There are plenty of good bits in it. But unfortunately there is also a lot of junk, this is probably their worst vocal performance to date. Many others have already pointed out the numerous Savatage songs sprinkled throughout the work. While I would like to have all new material, the old is spiced up enough to make it acceptable, and TSO has always been more palatable for most people, so anything that might make someone go and check out \"Dead Winter Dead\" or another of their disks is worthwhile. My biggest gripe with this disk however is something I haven't noticed anyone bring up (and maybe I just missed it, if so forgive me.) This story is just plain poor, not to mention tediously long. While O'Neill always seems to go for story's that reach high and go for an uplifting message (and historically he has succeeded) this story just fall's flat. It tries too much and has no true emotional hook like the previous stories (perhaps that three of the others were based around Christmas a time of year most would associate with hope and redemption had a lot to do with their success.) There is an exceeding amount of amateur philosophy that tries very hard to sound eloquent and deep, but really isn't and comes off sounding idealistic and naive. Also the change by the General is utterly unconvincing, too quick and sadly predictable, the man has a 10 minute conversation with a dying guy who he just met, who just wants to see his kid, and throw a baseball around. He then throw's his entire life and outlook away, to travel to the other side of the world and say \"I'm sorry.\" Oddly his repentance doesn't go far enough to feel true guilt, or accept the responsibility and consequences of genocide and the war crimes that he's guilty of. Instead he tells his story to the young daughter of the Lieutenant, and lies that his earliest memories were of him in NYC when if fact he met him at least a year later. Then he sails off to find the old man and the castle and we surmise lives happily and unjustifiably ever after. Now the musical execution of this album is top notch, and the songs don't really reflect how bad the story is until you read it. Several of the vocal performances work fine, but a large number (esp. the very few female and choral) fall flat, esp. when compared to the bands previous output. So on a whole the album is simply decent. It's not a masterpiece and it's not utter trash, but an average and unremarkable album. The only thing that makes it such a disappointment is the bands catalogue as a whole; otherwise it would be a 4 star album on a good day instead of an average album of 3.  As a last note, it's nice to finally have a long time concert highlight (Carimna Burana) in album format. I was disappointed though that it was relegated to a \"bonus track\" as I was quite looking forward to its being integrated into the story. My final point is that the recording of \"Believe\" was an utter abomination. It's one of the most beautiful and powerful songs I've heard, Jon Oliva's vocal performance of it on \"Streets\" is one of the best given. Not only did the song not really fit into the album (and I've long feared that this song would make it into one eventually) to have anyone but Jon perform it, is paramount to someone other than Jim Morrison performing \"The End\" (although I will admit that Travis Meeks did a respectable job at it.  The vocalist voice didn't fit the song, and though the song is too well written to ever be bad, he ruined it. Given that Oliva worked on the album, and wrote many of the songs, they should have just put him in front of the microphone and ended on a high note. So all in all if you like their albums, buy the album, I doubt you'll be blown away, but if you take it as a decent disk and a natural lull in an otherwise stunning career (and a great price), you should find enough to enjoy making it worth the purchase.\n", "val": 4.607495793607086e-05}

On some of the songs they re-did they cleaned up and added some things that gave some more life to the old tunes. On some of the other songs that they re-did the over polish shone through and killed some of the sharp edges that gave the originals their shine.

It is well worth it!  Once again, thank you for the music! Being a musician, I understand how hard it is for you guys (and gals!) to keep the music going at your level, which is the top. The lyrics are masterful! More importantly, thank you for keeping this affordable for me.  A double album that is fantastic and does not make me break my bank account! Maybe some other bands can learn from you that it is not about making money, but about making music. Also, YOUR CONCERT SHOWS ARE THE BEST!!! I believe it when the band says that their money is on the stage for the fans. I have seen many rock shows and no one else even comes close to a TSO performance. These guys walk the walk that they talk, meaning none of them are zillionaires because the money is on the stage through the best lighting shows, best singers, and best of just everything! I can see that they are trying so hard for their fans. The band meets us (all of their fans) after every show in their meet and greet line! Who else does that? I tried to set-up some cool lights for my band, but just simply could not afford it without drastically increasing my ticket price, so I did not, but TSO does and even seemed to lower their ticket price even though the show's production costs must be huge.  Also, THERE is a musical coming out called \"Gutter Ballet,\" and that is why there was a re-cut of the song \"Believe\". I will definitely be first in line for that performance!

{"text": "I believe there is a need to label this work as a new Genre \"Classical Rock\". This new album is much like Beethoven's Last Night. If you like that one you will like this one as well. TSO provides music with craftsmanship and passion unlike much of the music produced today. The musical style mixes Classical, Metal and Progressive Rock to create a truly unique musical experience that is powerful and delicate at the same time. I have been to several of the TSO Christmas performances and was fortunate to experience the show in a small venue in Detroit and had an opportunity to back stage during the performance. TSO and Amazon have offered the greatest deal in music in my opinion. I jumped at the change to purchase this latest work at such a low price.

{"text": "Most people that follow Trans-Siberian Orchestra know that they are also Savatage, but Trans-Siberian has the Orchestra.  That being said, for those that don't follow Trans-Siberian Orchestra and want to buy a Christmas Album off of Amazon need to know what to expect.  Trans-Siberian Orchestra makes magnificant Christmas Albums, but they are not what one expects to hear played over and over on the radio...(with the exception of Mad Russian's Christmas), rather it is more of a Christmas Rock Opera.  A story beginning on Christmas Eve and concluding with a Christmas Miracle.  The lyrics are fantastic and the music amazing.  Trans-Siberian also gives the lyrics and the story in a nice little \"book\" in each cd it makes.  That being said, read the story and lyrics while listening to the cd to really get a great picture of their meaning.  Now, as far as the music, as I stated before Trans-Siberian (had/has) an alter band named Savatage.  They do very similar Rock Opera type CD's, but not Christmas CD's.  Savatage is a great hard rock band with amazing stories and lyrics as well.  Check out Streets and Wake of Magellan as well as about 15 others.  They are a huge hit in other countries, more so than in America unfortunately).  Trans-Siberian is the same group of people from Savatage, but they add an equally talented group of muscians for their Christmas music thus becoming Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Although, they did Beethoven's Last Night with TSO which is OUTSTANDING.  I apologize for being long winded, but I don't want people to see this CD under Christmas albums and then purchase it only to find Rudolph and Santa aren't on it!  What I am hoping to do is encourage people to purchase this CD (as well as TSO's amazing Christmas Cd's) for what it is...a BEAUTIFUL Story using phenominal instrument arrangements and incredible lyrics coupled with pitch perfect voices.  You will be getting a \"head banging\" Cd that will melt your heart!  Night Castle took way to long to come out and a few songs are Savatage which causes me to give it only 4 stars, but it is without a doubt another winner for Trans-Siberian Orchestra.\n", "val": 0.018136028200387955}

On last years TSO tour they were doing \"Believe\" from the Savatage album \"Streets\", a new recording of that song is included on \"Night Castle\". For fans of TSO this album is more like the second half of the annual Christmas concert. So if you are fans of the second half (as I am) then you're probably going to like \"Night Castle\".

{"text": "5 or 10 years ago, I would not have thought anyone would release a pop album again that I'd really enjoy.  Pop music as I liked and knew it seemed to end in about 1990.  Most of it was missing a rock influence and adopted a hip-hop/R&B sound.  I found that to be pretty boring most of the time.  What was wrong with guitar solos in a pop song sometimes?  Imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon Annie's music last year.  It has synthesizers and guitars, two of my favorite instruments.  It's dancey and poppy but in an 80s sort of way.  My favorite song on the album is \"Bad Times\".  I was really surprised by this track.  It's very catchy and has a fantastic keyboard riff in it.  It's very 80s sounding.  I think it could have been a big hit if it had been released in the late 80s.  If radio would play this kind of thing, it could be a big hit now.  In the US, anyway.  Top 40 radio is pretty bad here.The album has a retro 80s vibe going on throughout it.  \"The Breakfast Song\" even has a tinge of a new wave sound to it.  There are even a few pictures in the booklet where she kind of has a mid-80s Bananarama/Madonna look going on.The reason I gave it 4 stars is that there were a couple of tracks that were left off that are good, like \"Anthonio\", that you can get on the two disc version.  I think that one should have been included here.  Also, I'm not crazy about the opening track, \"Hey Annie\", which I think is supposed to be an answer song to Annie from Anthonio (so I read somewhere, but I can't figure it out from the lyrics).  It's an interesting idea telling a story of the two characters in the songs, but if you don't have the Anthonio song on the album, you wouldn't know what that meant.Definitely one of the better pop albums out there.  Recommended if you like 80s music.\n", "val": 0.00019856954168062657}

One of her best new tracks is Anthonio, released on her All Night EP and also found in the special edition bonus disc of Don't Stop.  It's a love-lost story that pulses forward with a beat reminiscent of Kylie Minogue's Can't Get You Out of My Head.

{"text": "Trapped in production hell for nearly two years, Don't Stop is just that kind of balancing act of a pop album, one that dangles its legs over the precipice of radio trash but never really takes the dive. Indeed, for the first half Don't Stop is a retro DeLorean straight back into the `80s, glory days of synths, airy, reverbed vocals, and disco-fueled, John Hughes-ian odes to streaky romance. It's catchy and excellently produced, as should be expected, but the lack of spark behind songs like \"Hey Annie\" or the cheesy title track leave one familiar with Annie's work a bit worried. Too often the first third of Don't Stop comes off like mere outtakes of her fabulous debut Anniemal, save for the bouncy, frantic buildup of single \"My Love is Better,\" with some textbook Franz guitar courtesy of Alex Kapranos. This is something that would immediately make these first few tracks classics on any other pop artist's album but with Annie brings up the question; has the well run dry, or was Annie just a flash-in-the-pan novelty to begin with?Thankfully, starting with the sly kiss-off of \"I Don't Like Your Band,\" whose grimy, subtly threatening bass line and tap-dancing synth notes create the perfect atmosphere for this double-sided tune, Annie begins to separate herself from the Max Martin pack yet again. When Annie announces \"music so good / music so clear\" over the most direct, driving beat on the record on \"Songs Remind Me Of You\", the breakup jam becomes the theme of the record - Annie taking the most basis tenets of pop, music that can hardly be called revolutionary in any sense of the word (\"Songs Remind Me Of You,\" for example, is vintage Kylie Minogue done thrice as good as any recent Minogue song), and making it her own. A trippy, cluttered beat calls to mind a bright-toned horror movie on the haunting ballad \"Marie Cherie,\" while the slow, sexual stomp of \"Take You Home\" turns things in a whole new direction altogether. Aside from the misguided, blunt metaphor of \"The Breakfast Song\" (hint: it's not about breakfast), in fact, the remainder of Don't Stop is a manual's guide to effortlessly effective, genuine pop. From the what-if-Franz-Ferdinand-was-fronted-by-Annie tune \"Loco\" to ballad \"When The Night,\" which is rescued from unbearable amounts of sap by Annie's endearingly charming accent and honest vocals, Don't Stop is the kind of album that walks that aforementioned balance perfectly.It's the kind of balance embodied in closer \"Heaven and Hell,\" where a sunny chorus and a thoroughly well orchestrated array of atmospheric synths and effervescent drums contrast seamlessly with Annie's sprightly vocals and the song's love-and-hate lyrical matter. It's the kind of frothy, flawless pop song that makes you wonder what's in the water over in Norway, and, more importantly, where can we get more of it over on this side of the pond? Sustaining a career in pop music has never been about evolving one's sound, but rather maintaining the relevance needed to connect to millions of listeners in a time when pop culture is constantly shifting. With Anniemal and now Don't Stop, Annie makes a great case for best pop artist of a new generation, one who knows how to salvage the trash of artists past in order to make a new brand of bubbly, electro-pop confectionary that, thankfully, doesn't rot your teeth right out.\n", "val": 0.0011580813443288207}

{"text": "The Del McCoury Band hit another one out of the park with Family Circle. The tone is set with \"Sweet Appalachia\", written by Alan Johnston who is one of the best song writers in the business.  Listening to Del and the boys sing this song--well, it just takes you up into that beautiful land of Appalachia. Del's and Ron's vocals just take you up into the hills and hollows of Appalachia but more importantly, they make you feel the soul, the pride, and the strength of the Appalachian people.  Another cut that stands out for me is \"Revenuer's Blues\" which was well written by Del's son, Rob, and the one and only Ronnie Bowman. This was Rob's first effort at song writing and I expect to hear more from him in the future.  \"White Pass Railroad\" written by Laurence Baer is based on a true story about the White Pass Railroad being built during the Klondike Gold Rush.  This song is another of the many highlights of the CD. It is a `makes ya feel good' song that tells of one of America's engineering marvels and the `can-do' spirit of the men who built it. \"Prairie Wedding\" has a mystical, musical intro with Del's vocals telling the story of a man and woman who had never met but by letter, then marries and heads out into the vastness of the prairie to make a life.  Del`s vocals invokes the loneliness that must have been present during the westward expansion. A Del McCoury CD would not be complete without a blues tune from the bluest man in town and he nails it with \"Delma Blue\".  Del always includes a gospel song on his CDs and \"I'm Justified\" is a wonderfully uplifting one.  There's not a weak song on this CD.While Family Circle has fresh and all new material, it still has that vintage Del sound to it!

{"text": "I can't believe no one has reviewed this excellent movie soundtrack yet, so let me be the first.No doubt the reason you are reading this is you have, like myself, been a long-time fan of the 1972 movie, and were taken then by the way the soundtrack so perfectly fit each scene in the movie.This was, after all, a movie with extremely sparse dialogue between the principal characters, and one of the main allures of the movie also being it's stunning visuals of the Uintah Mountain landscapes, where it was filmed. In a movie like that, good music is especially important.Music can turn an ordinary movie into an extra-ordinary one, but it can just as easily ruin one. In this case, the music elevates this excellent, somewhat melancholy movie to memorable heights.As a stand-alone piece of music, this is worth listening to, but if you are also a fan of the movie, it's a must-have, as the music so effectively evokes memories of the gorgeous visuals in the film, you'll relive the movie every time you listen to the music.This is a largely quiet, winsome, and somewhat sad soundtrack, so I rather imagine it will appeal to those of like mind. I find it excellent to listen to as a means of relaxation, or to help pass some time sitting inside on a somber, rainy day. The several tracks of Tim McIntyre's songs will likely only be appreciated by devotees of the film, though I have always also found the lyrics to those tracks particularly thoughtful. All of the music heard in the movie is also included on the soundtrack, including the whole Intro and Intermission musical pieces.I suppose this soundtrack needs no reviewing for those familiar with the film- I've owned a copy for many years, beginning with the original LP recording, and still listen to it frequently, now 38 years later, and it still resonates with feeling. I guess that's about as high a recommendation as one can give, so listen, and enjoy.\n", "val": 0.02595743164420128}

{"text": "Jeremiah JohnsonThis movie came out when I was a senior in high school, in 1972-3. I was taking a class my senior year called Advanced Western American Literature, taught by veteran English/Humanities teacher, Coach Bob Cubbins, alis, \"Cubby\" at Glens Fall High School in Glens Falls NY. That's upstate, in the foothills of the Adirondacks.Interestingly, that year the movie, Jeremiah Johnson came out, and we went to see it as a class one Saturday afternoon. If I recall correctly, we sat there and watched it twice, back to back! I think we spent a month dissecting every aspect of the movie in class, as Cubby talked about every scene and how it was based on real mountain men, their activities, their lives alone, their rendezvous, their relationships with each other, with the Indians... It was fascinating in the extreme!Now, to have that sound track that I can play in my own classroom while my students are working, or as I drive down the road, is almost distracting. If you are a fan of the movie, own the DVD which you've watched going on a hundred times, and have fond memories of it, GET THE SOUND TRACK!

{"text": "Not many albums out there like this today. Awesome blend of pop, synth, rock, classic, r&b, and just about anything else you can think of. The lyrics are often good, sometimes great, sometimes lacking. The solos range from VERY GOOD (Glass) to VERY BAD (River of Brakelights). Julian is obviously the brains behind The Strokes, and his solo effort completely overshadows any of the other members' works. This man is just on another level.1) Out of the Blue - Good lyrics, decent music, sounds like something you would find on a Strokes album except for the added synth. Good way to open up the album but nothing really too special. 8/102) Left & Right in the Dark - One of my favorite tracks on the album. It has a very catchy chorus and really does well in building up energy. This is one of the poppier sounding songs on the album. 10/103) 11th Dimension - Awesome first single. Really shows Julian knows how to write a very radio friendly dance track that makes you want move around a bit haha. The lyrics on this one are among the best on the album. It seems to reflect a lot of how Julian was a shy person and all that stuff. 10/104) 4 Chords of the Apocalypse - This song kind of reminds me of a bluesy Beatles song, especially around the chorus. The music isn't anything that really jumps out at you but the lyrics are decent and the overall mood of the song really breaks up the album pretty well. 8/105) Ludlow st. - This was one of the songs used on the preview video for the album, and as such I expected it to be a stand out track. It's not. If there was one song I could do without on this album, it would be this one. Not to say it's a bad song, but following 4 Chords up with this track doesn't make much sense to me. Ludlow st seems to be building up to something the entire track but it never gets there. It reminds me a lot of \"On the Otherside\" off \"First Impressions of Earth\" so if you like that, maybe you'll like this? 6/106) River of Brakelights - Although I didn't love it right away, this is probably my favorite track on the album at this point. The solo is AWFUL but the rest of the song more than makes up for it. The lyrics are the best of the album, the music is awesome, the way it builds is awesome, Jules' screaming the chorus is awesome. Great song. 10/107) Glass - Probably my second favorite track on the album. This one was also used on the promo for the album but unlike Ludlow st, it definitely lives up to my anticipation of it being a stand out track. The lyrics are pretty good, the beat is great, the solo is AMAZING. This songs creates a very cool atmosphere and that's where it really stands out. 10/108) Tourist - Although I don't love the chorus so much, the verse is awesome. The beat is amazing on this one, it's a great track to close the album out on. Kinda makes me wish there were more than 8 tracks. 9/10\n", "val": 0.011723696254193783}

{"text": "After the release of the Strokes' third album \"First Impressions of Earth\" and the subsequent tour, the band went on an unofficial hiatus which is still lasting to this day. But it provided the various members an opportunity to stretch their musical legs. My favorite comes from Albert Hammond Jr. who has issued two albums, one better than the other: \"Yours to Keep\" in 2007 and \"Como Te Llama\" in 2008. Now singer-songwriter Julias Casablancas joins the fray and issues his own solo album amidst high expectations.\"Phrazes For the Young\" (8 tracks; 40 min.) is the classic case of a traditional A and B side to the vinyl album of old. The first 4 songs make up Side A and the opener \"Out of the Blue\" is by far the most commercially sounding track on here, and somewhat reminiscent of the classic Strokes sound of strumming electric guitars. \"Left & Right in the Dark\" and \"11th Dimension\" also are quite pleasant to the ear. Side A concludes with a pensive \"4 Cords of the Apocalypse\". As the next 4 song cycle gets underway, it made me realize that the further you go along in the album, the less and less it sounds like the Strokes, so for anyone expecting a Strokes album in all-but-name, save your money and don't buy this. Side B starts with a strangely mesmerizing \"Ludlow St.\", bringing a hotchpotch of sounds with brass, Eastern influences and more, but somehow it works great. \"River of Brakelights\" and \"Glass\" continues the now-ever stranger journey with yet more enticing musical adventures. By the time we get to the closing track \"Tourist\", a mid-tempo track with gorgeous musical layering that feels like a catharsis. It is my second favorite track on the album and a great way to close out the album.Don't make too much about there \"only\" being 8 tracks on here. They are all around the 5 min. mark, and I never felt that this was a \"Strokes-like\" short album. In a recent music magazine interview of Casablancas, I read that he has high hopes for mainstream-commercial success for this album, which truly surprised me, I mean, really?. I can see one track, tops, getting some commercial radio airplay, and even that is doubtful, given the sorry state of commercial radio. Not that this reflects poorly on this album, not at all. If you are not looking for a carbon-copy Strokes-like album, I venture you will be very pleasantly surprised. I know I certainly have been.\n", "val": 0.0031924538780003786}

{"text": "With The Strokes falling out of critical and commercial favor, the band went on hiatus, leaving its individual members to go their own way.  Three years and change after the band's latest release, Julian Casablancas drops an eight-song album, and instead of more '70s-influenced new wave/punk hipster rock, we're isntead hit with a love letter to the '80s.  Driven by synthesizers and drum machines, Casablancas has crafted an album that plays with layered music more than he ever has without losing sight of clear melodies and a great ear for what makes pop songs work.  Grabbing from countless influences, from asian music to country to soul, Phrazes is a strong statement from an artist viewed by many to be past his prime and no longer of any consequence.  At only 8 tracks there is little room for error, and this album makes none.  Each song is its own masterpiece, and the end result is a unified vision of the glittering pop of the early '80s processed through the dumpster of a mad genius, distorted and disturbed but still strong at the core. Sounding rejuvenated and determined, this is Julian Casablancas at his best. One of the best albums of 2009, and an easy pick for one of the best albums of the aughts.\n", "val": 0.029961571097373962}

{"text": "I'm usually suspicious of solo projects from a member of an already awesome band, mainly because they just aren't as good. This is an exception. Besides having the coolest name ever, Julian Casablancas is also a genius songwriter (just listen to any Strokes CD...), and his talent is not restricted to Strokes projects.\"Phrazes for the Young\" is a delicious ride through a carefully crafted world of synth-ey beats, amazing vocals, and sincere emotion. With only eight tracks encompassing nearly 40 minutes, I am always left wanting more. But despite the brevity, there is a song for every mood.The first track, \"Out of the Blue,\" is passionate but fun, with incredibly catchy lyrics--a great way to open an album. \"Glass\" and \"Tourist\" are definitely tied for my favorite. They both have AWESOME phrases that stay wonderfully stuck in your head (I've been walking around hearing \"bullet-proooooof...vest!\" for a few weeks now...). And then there's the first single, \"11th Dimension,\" the most eighties sounding track with a correspondingly retro music video. It is campy and intriguing, without taking itself too seriously. I'm usually not a huge fan of music videos, but I'd take the four minutes to watch it on youtube--it's fun, cheesy, and features some surprisingly good acting from Casablancas.The album as a whole has a slew of influences, from eighties pop to Johnny Cash to a bit of soul (and I hear a little bit of Thom Yorke in his voice), without being contrived. It is clearly a bit of an experiment, and I think that Casablancas' willingness to take chances generally pays off, with the occasional awkward moment (most notably the bizarre and grating \"River of Brakelights\").Casablancas' first solo effort is full of surprises that caught me off guard, and it took a few listens to really grow on me. There is an exquisite complexity to the album that prompts a craving for repeated listens. Let the genius of \"Phrazes\" sweep you away--you won't be sorry.\n", "val": 0.03243531286716461}

So I bought the whole album when it came out last year and now I'm insanely in love with it.  I even went to see J.C. in concert a couple of days ago and got to meet him after the show.

{"text": "\"Phrazes for the Young\" is a musically and emotionally brave album. Its lyrics discard the easy poses of nihilism and boredom for the hard work of communicating something: the wisdom gained by an individual (Casablancas, that is) who's experienced every trial, travail, and triumph of a life in which he's been hailed the next-big-thing and (prematurely, obviously) declared a has-been. Musically, Casablancas has somehow built cathartic, transcendent, timeless, and endlessly engaging songs around '80s-style synth riffs that would have verged on sounding cheesy even in their heyday. I agree with other reviewers that the two country/bluesy ballads in the album's middle are not \"Phrazes\" strongest tracks--but careful listening reveals their depths...as well as pleasant evocations of Brian Eno and Lou Reed exploring similarly unfamiliar terrain.

{"text": "What a complete surprise this album turned out to be; from the opening chords of ''Out of the Blue'' (my favourite cut on the album) to the galloping first single ''11th Dimension'', the Strokes frontman has managed to produce a non-Strokes album with some of the best of their elements intact. The expected guitar angst has been traded in for electronic elements and it sure as hell works-- that's not to say there are no guitars because they're on here but playing second fiddle to everything else instead. Excellent production and Julian's pitch perfect vocals make for an album I expect to be on the player for a big chunk of 2010. ''Ludlow St'' is the only track that sounds like a b-side or bonus track; the rest more than holds its own. An excellent debut solo offering from the man...\n", "val": 0.03919519856572151}
{"text": "Let me put this straight: the Strokes were not that good and I did not like them. So if you don't agree with this, do not read any further. It is true that they appeared at a time which was a low ebb for rock in general. But it was mainly their looks and attitude that made the impact. Their recorded output has been pretty small and of irregular quality. Even Is This It is not a masterpiece. Their recorded output has been marred by a sloppy sludgy sound and missing bite iin thier attitude. This impression of boredom also permeates the first solo record by Julian Casablancas. The cover of the record is ultra-weird, with all these red colors additionally to the HMV dog (what's his name again) together with a phonograph: he is on EMI, get it? Julian Casablancas also stares blankly at us and the record conveys this blank impression. As I wrote the production is not good and the sound really muddy. He has added keyboards this time (on french TV he had a pretty keyboard player at least) but they can barely be hard to great effect. Also there are no real tunes and he sounds bored. At least Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers knew how to be bores but still have that added \"je ne sais quoi\" that made them great:now there was a great NY rock band. This is the cheap version. Even Television was better.While 11th dimension is clearly the best song, it is not great: it starts really well but then instead of winding up it suddenly gets caught in a boring groove. Sad to say guys but this is not a good record.\n", "val": 2.132420559064485e-05}

{"text": "Well I will start by saying I enjoyed the album. Its actually awesome that the Strokes split up and gave us all these great albums. (Little Joy, Nickel Eye, Albert Hammond Jr, Megapuss). Its a darn good album it gets 3 1/2 stars in my opinion. I think a 4 star album should be a contender for album of the year (so if you feel that way by all means give it 4 stars, i don't feel that way about this album though), and i think 5 star means its close to perfect/a classic you will hear about years from now. This album is definitely not a 5 star album. But don't get me wrong its still darn good and Strokes fans will like it. I just want to balance the reviews out a bit, since i think 5 stars is a strong statement for this album.I also see a lot of people say how creative and genius this album is... Well I hate to sound so negative (i gave it 3 1/2 stars after all!) but this sound is just the Strokes done electronically. Its not something new, its just the band sound replaced by Julian doing electronic Strokes in a studio... Which isn't bad, but I don't understand the praise of it either. There is a drum machine through out which gets real old by the time you are done with the whole album. And the lyrics/Julian's voice are IDENTICAL to Strokes stuff; so again by the end i was bored with his voice. I hate to sound negative on it but again i feel the need for balance in reviews...Personally I think if you are looking for \"creative\" or new from the Strokes I would go with Albert Hammond Jr's album(s)which i enjoyed more than this; they have much more diversity, stray further from Strokes territory, and he changes up his singing style more often. Also Fabrizio Moretti joined Little Joy and Megapuss showing he obviously has talent as a drummer and those albums are super fun and well done as well. Nickel Eye is Nikolai Fraiture's solo project, and to tell the truth I would rather listen to Julian's album here, but I would have to argue that Nikolai Fraiture's is actually way more creative (different from strokes) and shows more talent on paper than Julian's.This wasn't a hate rant, I gave it 3 1/2 stars, its good! :) I just felt like responding to some of the other reviews. Just reading the glowing praise in some of them i don't see this album as steps above the other guys stuff.... In some aspects it falls short in my opinion. i say if you like the Strokes, this is perfect for you. I also say give all the side projects a try, and if rumors are true they are gonna make a new Strokes album again soon, so we all benefited in my eyes!\n", "val": 0.00027177552692592144}

I find that it truly possesses the creativity and originality people were looking for in Strokes music after \"Is This It\". The beats are exciting and almost always engaging, the lyrics are thoughtful, and Casablancas' vocals are beautiful and varied. I do think the album sags a little in the center when it slows down, but songs like \"4 Chords of the Apocalypse\" and \"Ludlow St.\" are still worth listening to. At least the vocals do not drone forever like in \"Ask Me Anything\" (First Impressions of Earth). In that album I felt Casablancas was almost holding back his band with his (sometimes) painfully boring vocals. This album proves Casablancas is the true artistic genius behind the Strokes, and he still has plenty of creativity left to share.\n", "val": 0.017057552933692932}

{"text": "Now with Julian issuing his solo album, that leaves just one Stroke that hasn't created one yet (Nick).  Maybe he'll put one out sometime before the next Strokes release.  Now back to Julian's album - it is another worthy addition to the solo album output by his bandmates.  I rank it up there with the Little Joy album and Albert Hammond Jr.'s first solo effort.  On the surface, \"Phrazes for the Young\" sounds like a Strokes album, but once you dig in further the songs shift and turn into something else, with only the vocals reminding you that this could be the Strokes.  The opening song, \"Out of the Blue\" is a strong start and could easily be a radio single if current fluff like Owl City didn't rule the airwaves.  The other tracks that follow grow even more ambitious (but still catchy), with \"Ludlow St.\" being one of the peaks.  The best way to describe that track is a cosmic country song.  The only song that doesn't do as much for me is \"River of Brakelights\" - it's an experimental song that could have used some good trimming and editing.  By the time the closer \"Tourist\" rolls in, all is well again.  If you enjoyed the other solo efforts from the Strokes, then this album is recommended.  Should be interesting to hear what the next Strokes effort will sounds like...\n", "val": 0.01380971446633339}
{"text": "Solo projects always result in the inevitable comparison to the band from which they originally became famous. In the case of Julian Casablancas, that original band is The Strokes. Casablancas, The Strokes' lead singer and songwriter, clearly took his time coming out with his own material. Albert Hammond Jr., The Strokes' rhythm guitarist released his first solo album in 2006 and has released a second album since. Nikolai Fraiture, the bassist for The Strokes, released his debut album with his side project, Nickel Eye, in January of this year. Even the drummer, Fabrizio Moretti, has done some side work with the band Little Joy. That being said, it's almost unheard of for the lead singer and guitarist of a band to be the last to release a solo record.So the real question is: \"was it worth the wait?\" For anyone expecting a fourth Strokes album, the answer is no. For the open minded musical manipulative minds that appreciate Thom Yorke's solo work almost as much as Radiohead, this album is certainly worth a listen. The album opens up with \"Out of the Blue,\" a track that maintains a Strokes feel while taking more chances lyrically. Following that is \"Left Right in the Dark\" which opens with hints of what's to come including synthesizer, but ends up evolving into another song that could be a believable B-side for The Strokes. Perhaps Casablancas was looking for an easy way to lure fans of The Strokes into listening to his new material because from there, the Strokes style is nearly gone with the exception of Casablancas' signature vocals complete with effects matching those used with his original band.The second half of Phrazes for the Young often plays like a Strokes and Beck collaboration. Things don't really get too crazy until track five with \"Ludlow Street.\" A little bit country, a little bit rock `n' roll, \"Ludlow Street\" throws in brass, off beat hand claps, banjo, the high pitched rotating effect of a Leslie speaker, a drum machine, and a handful of other effects. Two tracks later, the song \"Glass\" clearly takes its name from the most prominent instrument on the song.Julian Casablancas clearly made an effort to stray from the styles of his original band and the result is fairly successful. The Strokes' influences are still present at times, but Casablancas' solo effort is unique. Now that each member of The Strokes has released an album with a side project, fans might find it interesting to give each album released during the Strokes' hiatus a listen to hear where each member has contributed their own style to their original collaboration.Similar Artists: The Strokes, Jet, Franz FerdinandTrack Suggestion: Glass\n", "val": 0.010057033970952034}

{"text": "Isaac Hayes' classic soundtrack to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Shaft/dp/0790743752/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shaft</a>&nbsp;hasn't exactly been hard to find. The original double-album topped the Billboard chart, spun off a #1 Grammy- and Oscar-winning single, and ended up the biggest seller in Stax history. It's been reissued more than a half-dozen times on CD, and more recently it's been available for electronic download. So why another reissue, why now? Primarily because the Stax catalog has come under the control of Concord Records, and the label is, understandably, producing a new round of reissues. Reissues create buzz, press coverage and garner retail space, all of which helps keep catalog evergreens in the green, and keep royalties flowing to artists and their estates.Reissues also provide a chance to run a classic through updated technology, as is the case with this Bob Fisher full re-master from original analog sources. In addition, Fisher has produced a bonus mix of the title song. The new mix opens with a drumstick click track that was edited from the original, moves Charles Pitts' wah-wah guitar from right to center and deepens the tone (or simply increases the relative volume) of Willie Hall's high-hat riff. Is it a must-have? Not really, given the iconic nature of the original. The new mix is just different enough to make you wonder if something's off, but not different enough to give it a life of its own. A more compelling bonus for collectors would have been the edited, single version of the title song. Audiophiles with an earlier CD of the soundtrack may find Fisher's re-master an improvement, but casual listeners likely don't need to update.Those who've never heard the full album should give it a spin. Though the score doesn't measure up to the hook-filled catchiness of the single, it wasn't meant to. The soundtrack was written as incidental music in support of the film's action, while the theme was an expositional introduction to the film's main character. The bulk of the score is, as with most film soundtracks, instrumental texture and emotional underlining. Aside from the title theme, the only vocal tracks are \"Soulville\" and \"Do Your Thing,\" and the latter quickly evolves into a terrific 19-1/2 minute soul jam. The instrumentals create mood that often transcends the moving images for which they were written. \"Ellie's Love Theme\" is a tender mix of vibes and horns, \"Caf Regio's\" sports a breezy West Coast Jazz feel, and \"Be Yourself\" has a strong, funky party beat. The score is music worth hearing apart from its role within the film.Hayes brought his musical ethos to the project, but didn't set out to record the sort of genre-busting explorations of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hot-Buttered-Soul/dp/B0028NSE3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hot Buttered Soul</a>. The longer tracks find compelling funk and soul grooves, but weren't meant to push directly into the spotlight. Those looking for an album full of \"Theme from Shaft\" radio hits will be disappointed, but those seeking a helping of Hayes' genius as a composer, arranger, orchestrator, band leader and conductor will enjoy the soundtrack presented here. Even better, Hayes recorded the film soundtrack at MGM in Los Angeles and then re-recorded the soundtrack album at Stax in Memphis for better sound. Other great blaxploitation soundtracks would follow, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Superfly/dp/B00000342V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Superfly</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Across-110th-Street/dp/B0007YNRTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Across 110th Street</a>, but Shaft remains a primal inspiration.

Nothing here that has not been available many times before - the Japanese SHM-CD re-release earlier this year had better sound than this (although it was released as a facsimile of the UK Stax release not the US Enterprise original for some reason) and the re-mix of the title song was totally unnecessary - unless of course you - like Concord - are desperately trying to exploit the Stax catalog.There is nothing remotely of interest on this CD - but if you are a diehard Black Moses fan - seek out the Shaft Anthology on FSM (Vol 11 #8) for the actual MGM soundtrack that was recorded ahead of the Enterprise hit version. And for a remaster that is spine tingling - totally comparable to the Beatles Remasters program- go to Barry White's \"Unlimited\" box set on Hip O - well worth the investment!!When Concord acquired Fantasy and the Stax catalog a few years back they made a lot of noise how they were going to respect and promote the Memphis Sound and honor its legacy. The Stax website folded a year or so ago and the stuff that Concord has released has been less than notable - \"Stax does Motown\", \"Stax does the Beatles\" - hey how about \"Stax does TARP?\" Two lackluster \"new\" CDs from Eddie Floyd and Steve Cropper just about sum it up. When one looks back fondly  to the Atlantic Box set, the two Fantasy box sets and the numerous Ace UK Stax re-releases - one can only conclude that no-one at Concord - not even Bill Belmont  if he is stlll there- cares for anything but the money and they won't earn it with thoughtless re-issues like this.\n", "val": 5.664874333888292e-05}

{"text": "Alan Silvestri once again show us what a great movie composer he is. He instantly takes us into the feel of the movie right from the opening notes. He brilliantly incorporates many well known Christmas Carols into the score and depicts in his own music the various aspects of the characters of Scrooge and the rest of the memebers of the story as well. He uses the music to show us in sound the story just as well as Robert Zemeckis and the cast do so with the visuals and the dialog. You almost don't need to see the film to \"hear\" the story, thats how good Mr Silvestri's music score is. He knows how to create the right atmosphere in each piece, and how to get the music to help tell the story and to move the story along. There have been a couple of reviewrs that complained that there was no CD release of this soundtrack.I suspect that the folks at Disney decided that it would be too costly to release 45 minutes of music on a CD, Most people can burn a CD on their own computers if they really need one. Disney can always decide to release a CD edtion with the DVD or Blue Ray disc editions too.

{"text": "As I sat in the theater watching this movie, I knew right from the opening credits that I had to have this soundtrack.  This is Alan Silvestri at his best, captivating audiences with lush orchestrations and unique arrangements.  The soundtrack includes traditional songs such as \"Hark, the Herald Angels Sing,\" \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\" \"Deck the Halls,\" even a brief visit to Bach's version of \"Ave Maria.\"  Of course, it also includes plenty of original material, and the traditional carols are performed in such a way that it is as if you are hearing them for the first time.However, easily half of the soundtrack is more sinister in nature, including music from scenes in the movie such as \"Marley's Ghost Visits Scrooge\" and \"The Carriage Chase.\"  I typically skip these tracks when listening, as I do not find them entertaining or uplifting.Perhaps the best track on this soundtrack is Andrea Bocelli's performance of \"God Bless Us Everyone,\" which is short but completely embodies the spirit of this movie.  I adore Andrea's voice, and this song leaves plenty of room for him to showcase his talent, from his crystal clear tone to his high belt.  The joy and passion in this song are captivating and inspiring, and truly convey the awe and wonder of the film.\n", "val": 0.0522272028028965}
{"text": "Yeah, Christmas is here! Well almost anyway. At least Hollywood starts early, but that's okay. A Christmas Carol is of course one of the most beloved and remembered of Christmas stories. The famous Charles Dickens story has rendered numerous movies and adaptions and will continue to do so. Ebenezer Scrooge is a sad, angry man who hates Christmas. He gets visited by the three ghosts of Christmas who show him his past, present and future to get him in a proper Christmas mood. A timeless, wonderful story, this time animated  in full Walt Disney 3D. Starring Jim Carrey as Scrooge, Robert Zemeckis as director and Alan Silvestri as composer, we're in for a treat!I want to talk about the Zemeckis and Silvestri connection a little bit, because it's one of the reasons why I really was looking forward to A Christmas Carol. Whenever Zemeckis direct, Silvestri comes along for the ride and it has produced some of the most memorable scores ever produced. I have fond memories of The Polar Express, Cast Away, Forrest Gump and of course the classic Back To The Future. Now you know why I am so enthusiastic, you should be too! Of course this has set the bar high for both director and composer and honestly, I expect nothing less than brilliance from both. Bernard Herrmann, Stephen Warbeck Alan Menken (and others) have done versions of this movie before, and now it's Alan Silvestri's turn.Right from the start, Silvestri takes control and renders a beautiful opening theme in `A Christmas Carol Main Title' which has all the hallmarks of Christmas. It includes some original writing from Silvestri and some classic Christmas songs put in there for good measure. The mix is potent and it's wonderful. So far, Silvestri is right on cue to make A Christmas Carol a Christmas classic. The illusion of a Christmas classic is held for a while, but the illusion breaks like when I realized Santa Claus wasn't real. Okay, it might not be this heartbreaking, but before we venture into the negative stuff, let me assure you that this is a good score, a very good score in fact.Searching For MagicI have to mention this, but the magic of Christmas is a bit lacking. The magic I felt when watching Edward Scissorhands for the first time with my sister while listening to the wonderful score by Danny Elfman. The laughter and the joy of Home Alone with John Williams enthralling score. There's just something missing here in Silvestri's A Christmas Carol to make it a true Christmas classic and I'll tell you what it is. There's too much fluff in here to be perfectly honest. The themes are missing, the great ones like the one from Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Cast Away and The Polar Express. Even in a Christmas setting, there are ways to incorporate that.However I have to say that this score surely puts me in a Christmas mood. There are also cues like `Scrooge Counts Money' and `Marley's Ghost Visits Scrooge' which does not put me in a Christmas mood at all, but for the most part it's highly enjoyable. The most enjoyable parts are the actual Christmas tunes and not Silvestri's original composing. Still it's Alan Silvestri's adaption and we have to give him credit for his great work.It's quite a short score, just under 42 minutes, but Silvestri does display some Christmas magic here that is deserving of mention. The original Silvestri parts are the cues lacking, whereas the Christmas tunes are the music that keeps this soundtrack in shape. This is not a Christmas classic, but undoubtedly a score that will put you in a Christmas mood. The Polar Express was closer in that respect, but this has enough magic and Christmas spirit to make you cheerful. Don't be a Scrooge! Take a chance on this score as you will discover some great material here well worth the admission price, even if it's a digital one.\n", "val": 0.03433007746934891}
{"text": "I've lost count of the number of times Charles Dickens' timeless tale of yuletide redemption, A Christmas Carol, has been re-told on the silver screen. The Internet Movie Database lists at least 50 productions with some variation of the title, ranging from versions starring The Muppets and Mickey Mouse to serious dramatic portrayals by Alastair Sim, George C. Scott and Patrick Stewart, and of course the classic musical Scrooge with Albert Finney from 1970. Director Robert Zemeckis's latest version continues the obsession with photo-real rotoscope animation he began in The Polar Express and Beowulf, and stars Jim Carrey in multiple roles, but mainly as the Victorian miser Ebenezer Scrooge, whose curmudgeonly life is forever changed when he is visited by three ghosts one fateful Christmas Eve.Alan Silvestri has scored all but two of the films in Robert Zemeckis's career, dating all the way back to Romancing the Stone in 1984, and encompassing such classic titles as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump, Contact, Castaway, and the Back to the Future trilogy. The pair has one of the most fruitful composer-director collaborations in modern cinema, with virtually each of their projects eliciting noteworthy music; thankfully, A Christmas Carol - their thirteenth collaboration - does not buck the trend. It's a full throated, sweepingly beautiful orchestral and choral work that truly captures the spirit of the season with lovely themes, beautiful Yuletide orchestrations, and even some thoroughly rousing action material.I suppose one could categorize a great deal of A Christmas Carol as \"Alan Silvestri's Fantasia on Famous Christmas Carols\", because a large portion of his score either quotes directly from, or is greatly inspired by, the traditional music of the season. In the glorious opening cue, \"A Christmas Carol Main Title\", the sharp-eared can quickly tick off subtle and not-so-subtle homages to the likes of `Deck the Halls', `Good King Wenceslas', `God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen', `Hark the Herald Angels Sing' and `Ding Dong Merrily On High', all arranged for a huge orchestra and choir, and filled to the brim with the seasonal charm and twinkly orchestrations - chimes, sleigh bells - that one would expect in a film such as this.The score's main theme seems to be an amalgamation of parts of the melodies of both `Deck the Halls' and `Good King Wenceslas', albeit skewed around and given the lush Silvestri touch, but it certainly has the right sense of warmth and appeal to make it an excellent cornerstone, and it's recapitulations in \"Let Us See Another Christmas\" and the joyous \"Flight to Fezziwigs\" are superb. In addition to this, there is a lovely refrain of `O Come All Ye Faithful' orchestrated for a pair of harps and an angelic choir in the beautiful \"The Ghost of Christmas Past\" (which also contains a barely-disguised re-statement of the Polar Express theme in the middle), while in \"Touch My Robe\" the choir bursts forth into a bravura refrain of `Hark the Herald Angels Sing' that is thoroughly wonderful.There's a burst of unexpectedly vicious dissonance at the beginning of \"Marley's Ghost Visits Scrooge\", and later in the cue some of Silvestri's trademark stabbing chord progressions and wandering violin lines courtesy of virtuoso violinist Rene Mandel make an appearance, rekindling fond memories of his Herrmannesque work on the likes of Death Becomes Her. There is more dissonance and tension in \"Another Idol Has Replaced Me\" and \"The Clock Tower\", while the madcap chase music, reminiscent of his excellent score for Mousehunt, carries through into the score's action music in cues such as the showstopping \"Carriage Chase\" and \"Old Joe and Mrs. Dilber\". As well as Mousehunt, these moments of high drama also owe a great deal to the unreleased action music from The Polar Express, containing as it does some of the same rhythmic devices and a similar sense of kinetic motion he brought to his earlier ode to the season. I've you've ever wanted to hear the melody of `God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen' used as an action motif, here's your chance!The score takes a decidedly spooky turn during \"The Dark Chamber\", with undulating woodwind lines, spidery string writing, and an almost Elfmanesque ooh-aah chorus giving the appearance of The Ghost of Christmas Future a suitably chilly air. The score reaches it's dramatic zenith in the powerful \"Who Was That Lying Dead?\", clearly accompanying Scrooge's terrifying realization of the dark fate yet to befall him, before rising to glorious heights of joy and relief during the finale, \"I'm Still Here\" and \"Ride On, My Good Man\", capturing the merry transformation in Scrooge's personality and his new-found appreciation for life and his fellow man.Everything is rounded off in \"God Bless Us Everyone\", a new song by Silvestri and his regular lyricist Glen Ballard based on the score's main theme, and which is performed with full-throated gusto by Italian classical music superstar Andrea Bocelli and an accompanying choir. Ballard's lyrics - inspired by the famous line uttered by Tiny Tim in the original story - are so saccharine they may cause diabetics to lapse into a coma, but it's heart is in the right place, and it's an absolute shoo-in for a Best Song Oscar nomination.If one was to make one criticism of A Christmas Carol it might be to say that incorporating this many traditional Christmas carols into the score in this way is a little predictable. There's a slight feeling that Silvestri almost took the easy way out, choosing to overwhelm the listener with tried-and-tested musical ideas familiar to the masses rather than bringing something completely new of his own to the table. Having `seasonal orchestrations' in a film about Christmas is one thing, but hearing several full renditions of famous carols in the score proper may strike some people as a little lazy and clich&eacute;d, no matter how beautifully they are arranged.Having said that, and being fully aware of all its influences and inspirations, A Christmas Carol remains a thoroughly entertaining album, with several sparkling moments of Yuletide magic. Personally, I feel this is Silvestri's most satisfying score since The Polar Express and Van Helsing five years ago. As is becoming Disney's habit, the score is only available as a digital download through online retailers such as Amazon and iTunes, and cannot be purchased in stores. But don't let that put you off; despite the lack of a little shiny silver disc to out on your shelves, there is still enough excellent music here to make the digital purchase worthwhile.\n", "val": 0.029682351276278496}

Well, Disney has decided to take on a more Hip Hop approach to their movie songs, to capture a new audience. That comes with the case with Ne-Yo and his latest track Never Knew I Needed from the upcoming animated film, The Princess & The Frog.

{"text": "Well he we are, nine months after the extremely versatile and talented Mr. Ryan Leslie dropped his long awaited debut album in Feb. of 09, and its now November of 09 and hes already delivered his sophomore set, Transition. And while Transition does have a bit of the \"Rushed\" vibe, it still doubles as a solid follow up to a great debut album, from this longtime R&B producer turned singer/songwriter. The best thing about Transition, compared to his last album is that it sounds a lot more focused. And its kind of ironic how his near classic debut album took approximately four years to record and finally release, and now his sophomore album only took Nine months to record and release with no pushbacks. Thats the definition of being efficient.  While Leslies voice isn't grade A, he still knows how to use it effectively without coming off as corny or fake... most of the time anyways. Like on the extremely corny and just flat out embarrassing \"Zodiac\" and the miserable attempt at a babymaker \"All My Love\". But most of the time on the album, Leslie's futuristic and sparse production is able to carry the music despite his lackluster vocals in certain areas of the album. Like on the very Neptunish sounding \"Something That I Like\", Ryan kills the track with his slick flows over a beat that sounds like it could have been pulled right off of Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury album. And \"Never Gonna Break Up\" has a very dreamy mid tempo beat, complete with Ryan Leslie's signature crooning style of singing, but again its the production that truly shines on this track. But on \"Guardian Angel\" its Leslie's vocals that shine on the track instead of the beat, even though the beat is pretty good too, its a track that Ryan Leslie actually sounds 100% convincing with his vocals on the track. And on the very futuristic sounding \"Sunday Night\" Ryan shows us why he is a very in demand producer, despite the song having some weak lyrics. But in order for this album to be truly worth the purchase, go to Best Buy to buy the album because they have a limited edition of the album that has three great bonus tracks, and a honestly kind of lame DVD. But the three bonus tracks are all worth the extra 2 dollars. One of those bonus cuts is the mid tempo ballad \"Promise Not 2 Call\" which has become one of Ryan Leslies infamous youtube videos, where he produces and records a song while video taping the whole process. If you haven't seen that video, youtube it, cuz it's pretty cool. And the very contemporary sounding \"Rescue U\" is another standout track on the album. But overall, Transition isn't quite as good as his self titled debut album, but it serves as a really solid follow up album. It's nothing truly amazing, but its solid considering how short of a time frame he had to  make the album.Grade:B-\n", "val": 0.005743976216763258}

{"text": "I first heard about Ryan Leslie in 2009. That song was Precious by Jim Jones, off his Pray IV Reign album. I loved it, but I wasn't into r&b in 2009. Or for the next 3 years.If there is one thing i've learned, its to give everything a chance and to have plenty of patience. Impatient people get less out of the world. Think... Reese Witherspoon or Megan Good? Not too many hooked up with Leslie, the only ones I can think of are Jim Jones and Fabolous, both who did in 2009.That doesn't mean he's not a huge hit. Leslie doesn't do too many ballads. I think he has the potential of Usher, but he hasn't been around too much in 2013. Maybe we'll hear from him in 2014.1) Never Gonna Break Up- The instrumental is beautiful on this song. Ryan Leslie is pretty catchy, and it's a great opening track. It's not an intro, it's a song, which is always a plus. 5 out of 52) Something That I Like- You'll like the hook. The beat is out there, but it actually fits the song. Pusha T, who is suprisingly more on point than expected, makes you look forward to his own material. Ryan raps, but he doesn't drop the ball. 5 out of 53) Zodiac- The signs thing has been done before, but it's a good song at second or third listen. It's actually pretty seductive; I like Ryan Leslie's perspectives. He sings really well before rapping. 5 out of 54) Is It Real Love?- Not as hooky, but the singing is real on point. It is pretty seamless, so you probably won't notice unless you're trying. He is starting to prove he is a great singer. 5 out of 55) Sunday Night- This song was one of the reasons I picked this album to review. A lot of the time it takes me a long while to like, let alone review r&b. But the production and singing really make this album sail. The production is HOT. 5 out of 56) You're Not My Girl- The first single. Ryan had already dropped an album in March of 2009, and this one came out in November. He had a busy year. The first single has to be good, and even though I never heard this song, it's real good. The singing really gets nailed. 5 out of 57) To the Top- It's a bit obscure, but like Dream, Ryan is good no matter what element he's in. It is a second, third, or fourth listen, however. Singing is still top notch. 5 out of 58) Nothing- Here's another reeaal hooky song. It's a huge rebound from the last song, as you won't have to listen this one multiple times to like it. It's your decision which way of the two is better. One of the best songs on the cd. 5 out of 59) Guardian Angel- The singing is pimpish to the max. Not as hooky as the last song. All of the rest of the song checks out. It doesn't botch the album up. 5 out of 510) All My Love- I'd say this is a first listen song. The beat is one of the best, and mixes real well with the singing. Even the hook is back where it should be. If you never have heard of Ryan Leslie, this is a song to start with. Or Precious by Jim Jones. 5 out of 511) I Choose You- The second single. This album didn't make it very far, but the quality is outstanding. When I looked this album up, it said Ryan made this whole album about one relationship. I'm not going to delve to confirm it, but it does sound like he's talking to one person. This is a slower song, but the singing is great. 5 out of 512) When We Dance- This should have been a single. Starting here, it's the deluxe itunes version with three bonus tracks. The song is nailed, and when I first heard this song, I was glad I bought the cd. Great beat, one of the best, and the vocals are amazing. 5 out of 513) Promise Not 2 Call- I think this sound kind of bounces everywhere. It's not a first listen song. The vocals are still real smooth. 5 out of 514) Rescue You- Another rebound track. It's hard to classify it, so let me know in the comments where you recommend playing this song. Leslie has been on point with his singing the whole album, so I didn't expect him to drop the ball. Which he doesn't. 5 out of 5If you have read any of my earlier reviews, you know I give a lot of music 5 out of 5. I do that because once you like someone, you'll think they really didn't drop the ball after listening to the songs more than once. It's a good life lesson.Ryan Leslie nailed it with this album. I think I'm excited going into his other two albums. More people need to get hooks from this guy. Let's make r&b return to the charts in 2014.Pros:Ryan Leslie is an accomplished singer.

They went on to have a relationship during the summer of 2009, which the album tells the story of.  Some of the songs don't work, however there's enoungh strong material on the album to make up for it.

With all respect, I'm a fan, but this album was boring nothing new that has already been done.  He should have never released this album so soon or at all if these tracks were still going to be on it.  I think he was definitely feeling himself and his ego, or he had an obligation to his label and business partners / sponsors / backing.  Perhaps contractually obligated to put this out in a short time frame, you know the music business execs most likely pushed him to ride his hype, kudos, and award nominations after the first album.  However, you end up sacrificing quality and ultimately in the music biz your as good as your last hit.  This man creates unique and refreshing music and this album does NOT display his full potential.

{"text": "By R.Les's standards this is a sub-standard album. His first outing was almost perfect....I mean, remove the mess that was the out of place track with some girl called Cassie and everything else is \"Just Right\". How can he ever top Gibberish? Impossible? Even Prince doesn't write songs as clever as that and he might be the greatest songwriter of all time. Anyway, he definitely sings more like John Legend or Omar than Prince, but his songs have more substance than Legend's.So to a review of R Les's Transition. It kicks-off with a Ryan Leslie trademark sounding track that feels like it could easily have been written for the first album - \"Never Gonna Break-Up\". Sometimes this guy is too smooth with his lyrics. It's a nice antidote to the souless \"have a baby by me, be a rich hoe\" nonsense that these so-called songwriters just out of nappies are vomiting-up these days.\"Something That I Like\" is a nice sounding groove with the Neyo/ Chris Brown sounds and effects, but without the pop/ dance commercial writing style that the other guys seem to spit out like they forgot their roots.\"Zodiac\" is something most people not into Minneapolis P-Funk won't understand. On this track he must have swallowed a dose of 1980s Prince, Jesse Johnson & The Time. This is such authentic sounding Minneapolis Funk that it could easily have been lifted from any Morris Day and The Time album. This is what puts him alongside Pharrell and way ahead of Neyo, Brown & Legend......the guy knows black music beyond the restrictions of Michael Jackson, Mowtown & Stax. He takes everything that's good from the old and new and mixes it together.\"Is It Real Love\" is pleasant enough. Sometime the disjointed beat irritates, but it will do.\"Sunday Night\" is where the album gets hot. I'm feeling this one. It describes exactly how I spend many weekends. Go R.Les....this one has a serious bass line and drum pattern.\"You're Not My Girl\" is the stand-out track on this album. This could be a classic groove (the Gibberish of this album). Some great melodies, nice upbeat tempo, great bassline and chord progression. It reminds me of Terry Lewis & Jimmy Jam penned stuff from the 80s & 90s, with more up to date sounds and vocals that weren't meant to be on a groove like this, which adds a nice level of danger. In an interview with Chris Rock, Prince once said something like his best songs were the ones that had a bit of humour in them (\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" springs to mind). Well if you listen to the lyrics in this track you've gotta laugh.......at the very least (if you're a guy who's been there) you'll smile. At the end of the day, this is a nice, clean song about a dirty hoe, which makes it even more hilarious!Ironically \"To The Top\" is where the album goes downhill. This could have been a great song. Nice melody and vocals. But Ryan, who on earth is gonna be able to dance to a song with as disjointed a drum pattern as this. Sort it out on the remix mate (stop listening to Missy Elliot)!\"Nothin'\" is.......well why oh why did he bother. When he bothered he should have sold the track to T-Pain, Britney, Sting (for the white-reggae/ Jafake-an sound underlying) or George Michael. Weak pop rubbish and probably the worst thing I've ever heard from him.....oh yes, there was that song with Cassie!With \"Guardian Angel\" because it's a love song I will always compare it with \"Gibberish\". It's ok but nothing special. Not good enough for the first album.The intro and chorus of \"All My Love\" sounds like our UK soul king Omar, who must have inspired Legend and Leslie. It's very much an album filler to enjoy in the privacy of your living room or bedroom. Again, not good enough for the first album.\"I Choose You\" reminds me of what lets down most American R&B artists. They make a great album then feel the need to end it with a wishy-washy, weak, unchallenging song that could have been written for the last scene of an episode of Fame. Yes, he wrote this one for the Kids from Fame - Kci & JoJo used to do it all the time, even when they re-released their first Jodeci album and added the song \"Cherish\" which was a cover of a very weak Partidge Family song. Come on Ryan, you can do better than this.But wait, bonus tracks:All three tracks are good. \"Rescue U\" has a very contemporary sound by R.Les's standards. It could be big in the clubs with the right remix.All in all this album is not as strong as the first album, but far better than the rubbish that other R&B artists are releasing these days. It would be interesting to see what would happen if Ryan worked with someone like Prince, Teddy Riley, Babyface or Pharrell. He's in their league and is the remedy to all the boring vocoder driven, Timbaland/ T-Pain/ Black-Eyed fake R&B that is being mass-produced these days. Ryan can write, sing and play. Hopefully the next album will be closer to the consistency of the first album. However, there's something here for everyone who likes soul & funk.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Transition-CD-DVD-Combo/dp/B002RSDWNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Transition [CD/DVD Combo</a>]\n", "val": 0.013914747163653374}

Now, on his new album while his songwriting has improved, other things have not. He has tried to establish a distinctive sound on his debut as well as Cassie's album, which he wrote and produced. Throughout \"Transition\", he has a tendency to get a little nerdy- excuse me, a little N.E.R.D.-y. It's almost as if The Neptunes were overseeing this project the way that it sounds. Not helping is the song \"Something That I Like\" which features Pusha T of the Clipse, who are The Neptunes' longtime collaborators. \"You're Not My Girl\", \"Zodiac\" and \"Sunday Night\" sound as if Ryan owes Chad and Pharrell some royalty checks.

If you're looking for all the weight and intensity that comes with Tool / APC, please stand by for their upcoming albums [rumors!]. Puscifer is meant to be enjoyed lightly. Put all expectations aside and have a good time.For you sinful nonvirgin Puscies: 3 new tracks, 2 live performances, 1 song with Milla Jovovich. WORTH IT.\n", "val": 0.01923414133489132}

{"text": "Puscifer's mucic is a far cry from Tool, a far cry from APC, but still different and good and amazing.  The first time I heard Puscifer I was completely suprised.  As a die hard Tool fan, it was unexpected. However, it has become a bit of an addiction for me, as it satisfies some other need in my little hamster driven mind. Trying to figure out what \"you know who\" is going to come up with next is a foregone effort; who knows.  Im along for the ride.  This EP has a couple live tracks with amazing sound quality, so don't let that throw you. I really dig these songs, either new to the Puscifer library or yet more remixey/live oddness.  **update** Been listening for a couple days now,OK, I lied, I LOVE this EP...Id venture to say more than the \"V\".  Amazeballs!\n", "val": 0.014884162694215775}
{"text": "If you like Puscifer already, then you probably have heard most of this album. The last two tracks on it are the only tracks not previously released on their website. The last track on the album is very much like a song A Perfect Circle would have put out and could have easily been included on Emotive. It's a good song just not like most of Maynard's work with Puscifer. The best song on the album is of course The Mission. This has been my favorite Puscifer song since I first heard it. My wife and I were lucky enough to get to see Puscifer perform their first 3 shows in Vegas for Valentines day weekend, and when Milla came out and sang The Mission it was definitely the highlight of the weekend. Anyway, I can't seem to get enough of Puscifer's music, and this album only makes things better. If you haven't heard any Puscifer music, this is a great place to start. If you want a sample first, just go to Puscifer's website they have all their music streaming for you listening pleasure. Enjoy!\n", "val": 0.014522090554237366}

{"text": "As a side-project of Maynard James Keenan, Puscifer has been nothing if not polarizing. Like many, I started out, at very least, a bit confused by what I heard on their early E.P.'s. The sound was raw, but beyond that, it seemed unfocused - more of an experiment in sound than a real attempt to make \"listenable\" music.As others have said, that changes with this E.P. While it still sounds nothing like TOOL or APC (nor should it), it does finally sound like Maynard James Keenan with his musical genius intact. While the stream of releases from Puscifer that included little new material and endless remixes might have seemed like an attempt to cash-in, I find myself appreciating them far more now, as it feels as if we were given an inside look at the evolution of a sound and concept, which finally reaches it's potential on this E.P. Of the six tracks presented here, \"Potions\" and \"The Humbling River\" are the standouts - beautiful and haunting, raw in their sound yet polished in their production and presentation.\"C is for..\" is finally the Puscifer E.P. that I feel comfortable saying any Keenan fan should have in their collection.\n", "val": 0.015352741815149784}

{"text": "I highly suggest buying this EP even if you are not a Puscifer fan. I am a big fan of MJK's voice and the melodic and aggressive sounds APC and Tool have to offer, but the electronic style of Puscifer, in my opinion, covers Maynards voice too much, thus rendering it pointless to listen to. This EP, however, is an exception. In short, Maynard's voice is incredible on this album. The song remixes involve more melody and depth in the vocal lines in comparison to the low monotone effects heard on the previous albums. The instrumental scheme involves a nice balance of both electronic and 'traditional' rock instruments. Much of the material on this album is comparable to APC. The live recordings at the Nokia Theatre alone make this album worthy of purchase. My only complaint is that the album is an extended play and not a full length album.\n", "val": 0.0002758443006314337}

{"text": "I hate to say it but I've been well aware of Puscifer for quite a long time.  When V is for V***** came out, I wasn't sold, there were a couple catchy and interesting tracks that I dug, but I just didn't really get it. Well thankfully a friend of mine invited me to the SLC show just last week and I attended with much interest and anticipation. They were promoting this EP and for me it was my first exposure to the new material. It was so weird because seeing them live and hearing the new material, I got it, and I am completely obsessed with this new material, and I get the whole Puscifer mindset, it was like a light switch. Listen kids, this EP is well worth the price, every single song here is unique. The Mission is my favorite track here, and I find myself singing it in my head and listening it throughout the day. The big switch in tempo with Polar Bear is really sweet, and the live stuff and variation of Momma Sed and Vagina Mine are fantastic. They really mixed it well. The last two tracks Potions and The Humbling River is like others have said, there is a hint of APC, or perhaps it's just Keenans sensitive side showing a bit. I've made a few musical purchases this year and this is right there at the top of the list.\n", "val": 0.026247479021549225}

Most of the songs are about everyday topics such as washing your hands or setting the table, and this is an excellent way to introduce common vocabulary words.

My boys loved the music and ask to listen to this CD all the time.  This CD is also wonderful for students just starting to learn Spanish as well.  The words to all of the songs are provided in Spanish and English.  As a Spanish teacher, I will be using this CD in my classroom to help my students learn new vocabulary.

{"text": "I bought this CD to use with an early-elementary Spanish class. I love that it is completely in Spanish. I have not used it with my class yet, but there are some great songs to act out and move around to that I think the kids will love.Most of the songs are great. Some of them have accents on the wrong syllables, so I don't feel I can use those songs to teach kids Spanish because I can't have them learning to accent the wrong syllables. At least three songs have this problem: Abre el Refrigerador, Mono Chico, and Arana Pequena. The last two songs are translated from English. I have translated some songs myself, either from English to Spanish or Spanish to English, so I know how hard it can be to be true to the original meaning and still make the words fit and the accents fall on the right syllables. But when you are using a song to teach a new language, the phrases HAVE to be correct grammatically in Spanish and the words HAVE to be pronounced correctly. If you can't make it work, better not to do the song at all, or write a new song, rather than teach it wrong.I agree with one other reviewer that the lady who sings pronounces very hard T's. She apparently grew up bilingual, learning Spanish from her Mexican mother, but I have never heard a Mexican (or any native Spanish speaker) pronounce T's like that- they sound more like English T's. To me, it's not a huge deal- the words are still totally understandable, and not necessarily incorrect in Spanish, just different than I've ever heard.Those are just the negative points but I really loved the CD overall and I can't wait to use it with my class. The songs are very fun, interactive, and talk about things that little kids can relate to.

I'm the non-native speaker but minored in spanish in college, so it's important to me that our child grows up bilingual but also speaks proper spanish, not just spanglish! We're only about 6 months in but our child is already showing interest in music so I thought kid's songs in spanish would be a great way to start introducing spanish more into our everyday routine. I've picked up a few CDs that the music was either too fast, songs were too long, or the spanish wasn't easy to repeat. This CD is the opposite- the songs are catchy without being annoying, they are short enough to hold interest, have easy to sing along with melodies, and the spanish is very clear and easy to sing along with. In fact, after playing the CD only twice in the car while running errands, I already have several of the songs memorized enough to sing along to. The songs are also about everyday activities, like brushing your teeth, eating, getting dressed, etc. so it will be easy for me to sing them to our baby when we are doing those daily activities to help reinforce the spanish. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to introduce spanish to their child. would also be great in a preschool setting where spanish is part of the learning experience.

Sure, it's a big budget disaster movie super sized ballad, but I think the ultimate message of the song is really powerful.  If you look past the romantic longing implied in the first two minutes or so, the real message of this song is hope. The lyric \"'Cause I ain't giving up on us\" in context with the subject of the film drives home the point that there while there is a lot that is screwed up with this world, maybe if none of us gives up, things can get better.  And that single sentiment is what caused me to well up in my car on the way to work this morning when I heard the song.Secondly, the vocals are freaking unreal.

True this song is from the sound track of a disaster film, but that's not what comes to mind when you listen to the lyrics and the beautiful way that ADAM sings them.  Knowing the back story of the song makes everything so much more bittersweet and impending chaos completely disappears as the words say what the writer conveys as she lays dying.

{"text": "We started playing music in our infant's nursery after our first visit to his daycare, where we noticed them playing music in the crib room to provide white noise for the sleeping babies.  The idea of a lullaby-ized version of music we already enjoy listening to appealed to us, so we started out with a couple of the titles in the Rockabye baby series.  We've enjoyed them so much that we're now up to ~15 of these, if for no other reason than to provide US with some variety as we rock our child before putting him down for the night.  By removing the words and playing the songs at a more or less constant volume, they provide a soothing bedtime experience without the sudden changes in volume and tempo that might otherwise startle or excite a child that you're trying to get (and then keep) asleep.I was particularly excited to try this disc out when it was released and it has more than lived up to my expectations.  Although it is not our favorite of the 15 we have (the Coldplay CD continues to rank #1 in our house), it is easily a top 5 choice, and a great way to get your infant started on Guns N' Roses.  I would also highly recommend the Led Zeppelin, Queen, Rolling Stones, More Beatles (the first one is not as good), and Beach Boys CDs for people interested in trying out the series.\n", "val": 0.019057096913456917}

{"text": "With so many artists retreading their catalogs with concert performances of classic albums, Stephen Stills' career-spanning live set provides a different proposition. Rather than take his audience back to a single point in time, he takes them on the musical journey he mapped out for himself with Buffalo Springfield, CSN(&Y), Manassas, and various solo releases. The set list focuses primarily on the years 1966 through 1973, but reaches to Stills' last solo album, 2005's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Man-Alive/dp/B000A7Q1YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Man Alive!</a>&nbsp;for \"Wounded World\" (segued here with Joe Walsh's \"Rocky Mountain Way\") and draws in a cover of Tom Petty's recent Mudcrutch song \"Wrong Thing to Do.\"The show is split into solo acoustic and electric band sets, and rather than following a strict timeline, Stills has arranged the songs into a program that makes for a good show, with crowd-pleasing favorites placed strategically among the deeper album cuts. The solo tunes show Stills to still be a powerful acoustic picker (both finger and flat-pick), and though his singing voice is rough in spots, the song introductions and storytelling are incredibly engaging. Best of all, the disc provides generous helpings of between-song continuity and gives you a good sense of how the show felt as a whole. This is a document of a live concert performance rather than a cleanly edited set of live songs.The show kicks off with \"Tree Top Flyer,\" a 1968 solo tune that didn't appear on a commercial release until CS&N tackled it fifteen years later. Fan favorites \"4+20\" and \"Change Partners\" bracket a touching version of the Manassas tune \"Johnny's Garden,\" and a couple of covers, Dylan's \"Girl From the North Country\" and the traditional \"Blind Fiddler\" show off some of Stills' own favorites. The acoustic set closes with a 9-minute rendition of \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" that shows off Stills' blistering guitar skills, and provides a transition to the electric band set. The second set opens with the little heard \"Isn't It About Time,\" from the second Manassas album, and unlike the chestnuts that follow, the arrangement and performance sound very fresh as Stills adds some meaty Stratocaster playing.The Buffalo Springfield numbers are a mixed bag. They're stretched into jams that give Stills an opportunity to show that his guitar can reach heights that his voice can't always follow. \"Rock & Roll Woman\" retains its passion, \"Bluebird\" is reworked enthusiastically to fit Stills' limited vocal range, but a bluesy 7-minute version of \"For What It's Worth\" can't muster the vocal pungency of 1966, despite its on-going political relevance. Overall, Stills sounds more enthusiastic about the material that's newer to him, including his own \"Wounded World\" and the Petty and Walsh covers.The widescreen DVD offers the same track line-up as the CD, though with the option of DTS Surround. The only extras are a short intro clip by Stills and credit-roll clips in which Stills discusses the set list. The lighting and videography are excellent, giving viewers a chance to see close-ups of Stills singing and picking. He sells his songs with facial expressions, postures and body movements, and his lack of vocal flexibility is more than made up for by watching him rip on guitar. This is a nicely selected mix of hits and album cuts, performed with the freedom of someone with nothing left to prove. CD and DVD discs are packaged in a three-panel cardboard slipcase.

{"text": "A fine live set from the often rather underrated Stephen Stills caught live at the legendary Shepherd's Bush. Starting of with an intense acoustic set showcasing his considearble picking skills that ends with a surprise \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\", a song he hasn't played in recent years, here nailed perfectly. He even hits some of those high vocal notes. In fact he seems to be in the best of form both vocally and overall. Thx to a clean up of his act and succesful cancer treatment.After the break he dives into a solid electric performance backed by a congenial band anchored by the always inventive drumming of long time musical partner Joe Vitale. And here the show really takes flight with classics like \"Bluebird\", \"For What it's Worth\", \"Dark Star\". But also some lesser known tunes like \"Rock & Roll Woman\" and the stylish \"I Wanna Make Love To You\" (from the Stills-Young album).The often reclusive Stills comes across here as a humorous and relaxed performer facing a great and enthusiastic crowd. The days when he was a pioneering artist may be long gone, but he can sure still deliver a magnificient evening armed with a collection of songs many others would have to envy him. Blues, rock, country, latin, impressive wah-wah drenched psychedelic solos all blend into one.Like the recent brilliant album of Manassas outtakes<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pieces/dp/B002JG669C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pieces</a>this is essential stuf for any CSN(Y) fan.\n", "val": 0.026047255843877792}

Well -- Stephen Stills' performance in England -- captured on \"Live at Shepherd's Bush\", is a wonderful addition to the massive collection of this fan.  What makes the album work for me is that Stills gives some insight to the songs he's played over the past many decades and then performs them in his rugged style. The music that I've known since it arrived on the scene takes-on new meaning because there is more context now.  The album's bonus is a DVD of the concert which adds a great deal of energy to the music.  What a great find.\n", "val": 0.06974789500236511}
{"text": "I think most fans of Stephen Stills are aware of his history, and specifically that in the last few years he seems to have (thankfully) gotten his act together, cleaned himself up, and shed quite a few pounds. And like anything else in life, the hard-living years have taken their toll. That said...this was a pretty decent set. I've heard better versions of his signature acoustic track \"Treetop Flyer,\" and the opening electric track...\"Isn't It About Time\"...is a little too rough around the edges for me, considering how tight, smooth and slithery it came across on the second Manassas album.But then he launches into an insane \"Neil Young & Crazy Horse / Weld\" version of \"Rock & Roll Woman\"...one of his greatest Springfield tracks...and all is well with the world.\"Wounded World\" sounds a little too close to his earlier solo track \"Right By You,\" but considering the fact that it's used here to set up \"Rocky Mountain Way\" in the second half, that's OK, and a sloppy, raucous version it is, but hey...it's only rock and roll. He did something similar on his 1975 solo album, \"Stephen Stills Live,\" using the song \"Jet Set (Sigh)\" from the first Manassas album to set up \"R.M.W.\"\"Bluebird\" and \"For What It's Worth\" also get the \"Weld\" treatment. This might turn off some long-time fans and purists, but c'est la vie.\"Love The One You're With\" is a bit of an anti-climactic climax to an 80-minute disc...sure, it's one of his biggest solo hits, maybe THE biggest, but it seems more like an afterthought and less like an inspired performance.I do know what I like, and sometimes it's stuff that's in the mainstream and adored by millions, other times it's not. This may be one of those \"other\" times. For me, the Springfield trilogy...especially \"Rock & Roll Woman\"...made it worth the price of admission. The reunion at Bridge School it ain't...but it rips and stomps like a rock & roll survivor with something still left to prove, on both the electric AND acoustic tracks.\n", "val": 0.00017665234918240458}

When I saw a repeat date at the same venue, I could not believe my luck but when I turned up on the night it was clear the prior concert had been good enough to warrant a further gig to be recorded live which is what we finally have available here.I cannot add much to the other reviewer's comments on the specific details. The man is a great live performer whether playing either acoustic or electric and despite the odd performance glitches and rough edges. His voice at 63 is not quite what it was when many of the originals were recorded but still better than I expected and this set confirms my ears were not deceiving me on the night. What this recording (especially the DVD which is a song by song repeat of the CD) shows is that Stills has not lost any of his love of playing - remember when he was everywhere in the late 60s post Buffalo Springfield guesting as the Texas session supremo on many others records and that is the spirit you see on display here around 40 years later.The electric set probably has the edge with Stills able to expand and stretch out to best effect on lead guitar and with two of the three support band members being from the Joe Walsh band of the 1970s makes the version of \"Rocky Mountain Way\" even more pleasurable.\n", "val": 0.01660686731338501}

I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.  He needs Young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and Crosby/Nash to step up his vocals.

And then we move on to the electric part of the show again highlighting his skills as a guitarist. I caught Steve live (solo) about a decade ago and it was one of the best shows that I have seen far superior than seeing Neil Young or CSN live.

On listening to this CD my honest reaction is... He just sounds very tired throughout most of it, as if he can barely stand up and get the song out.I won't go through a critique of the individual songs here, most of them (though certainly not all) would be negative and there is no point in it. I can just say that by the time he reached the end of Rock & Roll Women, in which he removes the most energetic and demanding bars of the original tune, I realized this live CD was not created for artistic reasons. There is nothing new or interesting here, there is just Stills doing what he can in terms of performance at this late point in his career.Of course Stephen and the CSN gang need to continue making a living, and I am glad that they have it and what enjoyment they still derive from performing their old material.

{"text": "* For those of you who have put Stills down for many years and are now listening to this, it will not be what you remember from years past.  Stephen has some obvious vocal impairment now, I think primarily due to tinnitus.  However, for those of us who have steadily followed him for all these years, this show is a very solid performance, especially compared with a few years earlier on the CSNY Dj vu tour, where he was having substantial enunciation difficulties.  You have to give him a lot of credit for continuing to go it alone and delivering.* This show is quite similar (about 75% the same) to shows I saw live at the House of Blues and at the RnR Hall of Fame (both in Cleveland, OH) in 2007 and 2008.  I was really happy to see this rendition of `Isn't it About Time' recorded as I love the powerful opening bass and guitar run.  For me, this alone was worth the price of the disk.* The acoustic set is quite good, Stephen surprisingly hitting notes one thought not possible at this point. Others have mentioned this. Acoustic guitar is stellar as usual. The rendition of Johnny's Garden was on key and sung at higher tone than I can remember recently.  Another stunning version of `Treetop Flyer' which I never get tired of hearing.  Some (including him?) will say things got too personal and self-absorbed for Stephen as a young man, but `4+20' is one of his defining songs for the startling admission, beuatiful singing and lovely acoustic guitar.  Stephen gets a little winded in the electric set during `Wounded World' and `Rock'n'Roll Woman' but finishes VERY strong with `For What It's Worth' and `Love the One You're With'.  At 63, we might get winded too.* Some years from now, it would be interesting to see Chris Stills put a show together singing only the music of his father.  Chris has an incredible voice, maybe not with the power, edge, and range of the young Stephen Stills at the top of his game, but certainly close and with the flavor and tint of his old man that you readily recognize.  Chris does some Manassas songs now in his shows.

{"text": "If you've read Crosby's second installment of his autobiography, you know that he and Nash get off a couple of very pointed barbs aimed at Stills. Presumably, they were good natured. With his very first remarks on this set, Stills slaps the puck back into their net and scores magnificently, and then gets on with the business at hand, beginning with Tree Top Flyer and roaring right on through seamlessly to the closer, Love The One....Stills looks healthier, and by his own admission, feels so. His voice is coming back, much as Levon Helm's has, and that's just amazingly great news. While there is no new material here, the renditions, now from a 63 year old campaigner and defender of democracy, a cancer survivor, and a man who has lived his life with eyes open and his mind on, all sound brand spanking new and infused with an insight that comes from the road thus travelled. It ain't the years, it's the mileage, and Stills delivers a triumphant survey of his work. He has found different registers in which to cast his voice and the songs he has written. For my money, I think his take on Suite: Judy Blue Eyes and Rock and Roll Woman eclipse the CSN and Buffalo Springfield versions. The loss in both songs is more palpable, the tragedy accepted with a wisdom that knows one's life runs against time. His sense of humour is spot on throughout and there is even a sense of self deprecation, first evident in his tumble during the Deja Vu film and now in his wry asides about his own youthful perceptions found in Four and Twenty.There is a clarity of tone to his guitar playing that I haven't heard in ages and his command of his instrument and the Latin and American blues that are the bedrock of his influences ring with an authenticity that has been enhanced by age, by life. There isn't a lick throughout that is there as showmanship. Every harmonic, every chord and key sequence, every pluck and plectrum strike rings with authority. He takes on Dylan's \"Girl From The North Country\" and makes it his own - absolutely an astounding delivery. And the man looks like he's having fun.Stills has questioned whether he still has it, whether the Muse is still speaking to him, or if he can, through his tinnitus, still hear her. Based solely on this performance, I'd encourage him to keep at it. He has very clearly prepared himself in such a way that the Music is as much playing him as he the music. In short, in the words of another English guitarist, he has prepared himself so that Music can lean over and take him into its confidence. To that end, I would hope he will continue to sing, play, compose. He has something worthwhile to say, and I very mcuh want to listen to him.  For all his afflictions from a life such as his, he is a man alive with his muse and that's cause for celebration. Isn't it about time?\n", "val": 0.024671172723174095}

I've seen CSN and all the other versions over the years and have resigned myself to thinking that the best performances were behind us. But Stills' electric contribution to the Los Angeles concert was definitely the highlight and surprise of the event.The versions of Rock N Roll Woman and Bluebird were delightful. After the concert I was thinking how lucky I was to hear those songs once again, but how unlucky it was that I could replay those songs as they were performed that night again.But low and behold.....here comes this CD and DVD with those two songs included. It was pretty much the same versions without Crosby and Nash singing harmony. I like the new arrangements and the guitar solos as well. The makeup of the band makes Stills' song stand out more....no organ, percussions, extra singers, or other guitar players. It's a simple rock band with one guitar - one solo instrument.  And I loved it.As a guitarist myself, I haven't been a huge fan of Stills' electric guitar solos. But over the last decade, he's learned some new tricks (techniques) to create better sustained notes and bends. He'll never be as fluid as Clapton, but in a live setting with a song like Rock N Roll Woman, this guy can really soar.I'm so happy that this album came out and want to encourage any CSN or Buffalo Springfield fan to get it and listen to the new energy of Mr. Stephen Stills. Even his singing was surprisingly good for a guy who we all thought had completely lost it vocally.\n", "val": 0.01756664551794529}

{"text": "Bruno Mars is clearly One of the Baddest artists going today. as a songwriter, singer and musician not to mention as  a live act he got his thing together.  he came back with an album which was a tribute to the 80's and 90's and he wears his many influences on his sleeve. however he has his touch and one thing is that certain is that he can tap into the pulse of what is happening and yet take it back. he got more jams here which are on point. he got himself a  really  good album here and Bruno is versatile enough to last a really long tine and  he can beat you in various ways. he still is quite young in his career,however you can sense a artist who has a old school vibe with a new school approach which will be years of  greatness still to come.\n", "val": 0.001442399574443698}

{"text": "Bruno Mars 24K Magic is pure R&B radio bliss and showcases how the genre evolved over the years from 60s soul (the fun, energetic Perm) to New Jack Swing (Finesse). \"Versace On The Floor\" is reminiscent of Gregory Abbott's \"Shake You Down\". \"Too Good To Say Goodbye\" & \"Straight Up and Down\" feel like classic unreleased ballads also.I grew up on R&B, so this album is really nostalgic and close to my heart. There is an awesome wave of current artists dipping deeply into 80s nostalgia and doing it well, may I add. (If you like 80s synth pop with sexy sax, check out The Midnight). Bruno Mars contribute to that wave in a huge way. The album could have used just one more song to round it out; however, not one of the songs on the album is a miss. Cant wait to catch them on tour. 24K Magic is another Bruno Mars classic!\n", "val": 0.033539898693561554}

{"text": "Ill keep it short n sweet, just like the cd.All tracks are radio & streaming friendly, the main problems here are theres only 9 songs, the longest one is only 4:20 and the whole cd is just over a half hour.  You won't get bored, just wish it was longer.Mars is proud to cite the influences that shaped his career and this new album:  Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, New Edition, Bobby Brown, Jodeci, Boyz II Men, Teddy Riley and Babyface.  It all comes shining through- its all about having a good time.24K: pure 80s/90s Roger & Zapp sound.  Sets the tone for the rest of the party.Chunky: all about dat booty and the women proud of having it like that!Perm: remember when B-sides were the funkiest cuts?  A true old skool vibe starting out- like James Brown & The Time were jamming together.  And I really liked that rhythm guitar.Thats What I Like: beat reminds you of Bobby Browns Tenderoni.  This ones about treating his baby right with the good life, which is easy since hes already bout dat.Versace on the Floor: the first slow jam.  Romancing his baby while slow dancing.  Too much high-end synth for a slow joint, but eh- its ok.Straight Up & Down: your booty deserves a celebration/Im gonna celebrate it all night long! Ok, my dude.Calling All My Lovelies: talk about a throwback- this is pure New Edition/Jodeci/After 7 sounding stuff.  I got Moesha waiting, Aiesha waiting all the eshas waiting cause I cant get a hold of (places phone call and gets voicemail of HALLE BERRY?!?)  Damn, son.  Thats rough.Finesse- the beat is real familiar, just cant put my finger on it.  Best I can come up with is Stanley Jordans Street Talk or Sheena Eastons Talk About the Lover in Me.Too Good to Say Goodbye: pining for a lost love, this one hits all the notes.  Lover, best friend and more- and now you're gone.  Wasnt so much that Babyface needed to co-write it, tho.In every sense its over all too soon- songs are a little too short and there should be two or three more.  No trap queen noise here; its all about chilling with your people and your lady- you know, like R&B/Funk used to be.\n", "val": 0.007171071134507656}

Anyway on to my review.  This is basically the German release of the Cd Another Night but with some songs not heard hear in the U.S.  The cd contains 15 tracks: 1. Space Invaders (Intro)  2. Automatic Lover (Call For Love)  Awesome song never get sick of hearing the awesome beats of this tune  3.  Run Away  Can't ever get this one out of my head as well....just such a melodic tune  4.  24 hours.......a song not heard here in the U.S. its pretty good but i can see why it wasn't as popular as some of their tunes  5.  Love & Devotion ....awesome song  6.  Another Night.....the first world famous tune of The Real Mccoy where they hit the U.S. charts my all time favorite.  7.  I Want You...I love this song as well just something about it  8. Operator..pretty good not my favorite  9.  Streetfighter ....another song not heard in the U.S.  i like it  10.  Out Of Control...another new one....its ok.  11.  Je Suis Amoureux...not great  12.  How Deep Is Your Love...can see why these didn't go on the U.S. cd  13.  Another Night (U.S. House Mix)  14. Megablast.....crazy tune.....crank up the subwoofer and go wild.  15. Space Invaders (outro)  ....The Real McCoy rules for sure.......I would reccomend this to die hard Real Mccoy fans like me only.  I give it 5 stars as a Real McCoy fan....but if u are just looking for the best songs of the Real Mccoy stick to the U.S. versions they are more affordable and have the best music of a great group.\n", "val": 0.0001660405396251008}

{"text": "This album is exactly what you would expect from Bruno Mars with his signature energy, hype, and funk. He keeps this old school album short and sweet without the fluff which is nice compared to the almost two-hour albums that are more prevalent nowadays and feel like a drag to get through sometimes. The album has nine songs which features a blend of funk and R&B and showcases his range of vocals with no features. Other instrumentations include synthesizers, horns, and drums which help play up the energy throughout. Notable tracks were Perm, Versace On The Floor, and Calling All My Lovelies with the latter featuring a cameo from Halle Berry. These tracks also in their own ways contributed to the party and dance feel of the album and also showed Brunos lower register with bass notes.A highlight of this album was its conciseness where it was kept short and clean, not cluttered with features. The tracks are all hits and play to the party feel of this recording. They make you want to dance and sing along. 24K Magic also doesnt stick to a single era instead showcasing styles from various eras from the last several decades. Although the album starts off with the title track which is very fast paced and energetic, Bruno also includes the slower songs such as Versace On The Floor which takes out the wordiness of the faster pace songs and allows his voice to really shine through. I also really enjoyed the order and cohesiveness of the songs. The tracks flow very well. The album slows down slightly in tempo and rhythm towards the second half compared to the first which I like because it starts off with high intensity and keeps the energy high while tapering off towards the end by bringing you back down.What I felt could have been better was the lyrics. It seemed pretty surface level and doesnt delve very deep although he sings about his relationships on some of the tracks. They seem to focus largely around his wealth and women. Although the playfulness takes notice off of this aspect, theres not any meaningful lyrical content which might have made the album more worth it for its short track list. Right after Versace On The Floor, which was one of the highlights of the record, comes Straight Up & Down which I feel doesnt accomplish anything on this album. It comes off very mediocre with an easily forgettable melody even with the strophic form of the song and frankly does nothing lyrically. The line Oh baby we gon have some fun tonight, straight up and down, straight up, straight up, straight up sums up the gist of this track pretty well and lyrically is the same throughout. This song also is not necessarily slow enough for this song to get the mood he seems to be trying to get across with the song, and it rests at an awkward pace not yet fast or slow. Another instance where it lyrically takes away from the song is Perm, the third track on this album. I love the song, and the beat is very catchy and memorable, but if you take a second to look at the lyrics, itll make you think. From the first verse, Gotta do it in the penthouse, thats where I keep my pen alludes to his fame while also suggesting that for the girl to get his autograph, she has to go home with him.While I felt that the shorter album did well with not boring the listener, I also think that it can come off as too short. The album is barely over thirty-three minutes and seems end a little too soon. It could probably benefit from a couple more quality tracks. Also, while the feel-good album does a great job at making you want to sing and dance along, it lacks in originality since the tracks are very reminiscent of the past. You can tell that he draws a lot of inspiration from great artists like Michael Jackson, James Brown, Prince, and many more because his songs reflect the style of their hits. While I think its great that these artists have such a huge influence on his taste and style of music, I think that he could do with a bit more originality.Overall, this album has great energy with a party dance theme that gives good feelings but with no deep meanings. His tracks make you want to jump up and dance along which can itself constitute a good album depending on what one is wanting out of a recording, and it is a good listen.\n", "val": 0.0015030334470793605}

{"text": "Always love to go out and dance, and support musicians. Partially raised in Chicago, loved going downtown hearing the latest and greatest. Am an artist myself who sang, danced, was in theater, and recorded. Love this album, the rhythms, individual instruments, great vocals all mixed into this album. The many influences I can hear in his own brand of music are James Brown, Bobby Brown, Michael Jackson, Prince, guitar riffs similar to Isley Brothers, Earth Wind and Fire, a whole lot of Motown influence, combined with Sir Mars own personal choice of mixing in drums, whistles, strings, sirens, etc. ALL part of getting out there, giving a good show, but most of all, getting a funky, sweet sound of his own that stands out there ALL ON HIS OWN. With the help of his great band, the amazing choreography, and stage effects, Sir Mars and company won me over the night he produced \"Bruno Mars 24K Magic Live At The Apollo\". Not only is he an outstanding vocalist, musician and dancer, he knows how to put on one hell of a great show. I play it all the time for FEEL GOOD music, to not only dance to, but exercise and sing along. So so wish I could meet this man in person, much less lay down a song just for him based on what I have heard. A girl can dream, can't she? Best wishes on the next album. I'll be sure to invest in that as well as look forward to another show we ALL can see no matter where we are.\n", "val": 0.03239840641617775}

Amazon replaced the first record without hassle, but the second record has the same problem.  Will be returning it officially today or tomorrow.

Bruno went back to the old school, even with the number of songs on the album.Some artists have good recorded performances. Some artists have great recorded performances. Then, there are some artist that create an experience with their records. I would categorize Bruno and this album in the last category. This is one of the best complete albums that I've heard from a current artist in a while.\"24K Magic\" and \"Chunky\", will have you dancing before you even realize it. They are just really feel good tracks. Those kind of tracks that you listen to and you feel honored, proud and privileged that you own them in your music collection.\"That's What I Like\" will have you bobbing back and forth.You will get lost in the on point harmonies of \"Calling All My Lovelies\" and \"Perm\" will have you attempting to emulate some James Brown moves when nobody is looking.As far as the rest of the album, it's just chill and great. Some artist have one or two great songs for singles and the rest of the album is not good. I my opinion, there are no fillers on \"24K Magic.\" Some have said that this album is \"Over-Produced.\" I would argue that it is \"Impeccably Produced.\" If I ever get to meet Bruno 1.

In a nutshell, Bruno Mars has done it yet again, continuing to find inspiration from the past and multiple genres and cohesively weaving them together to create new magic. You can hear all of the funk, R&B, pop, & soul in this album and so much more. The best part is if listened to closely, the album tells a great story! Plainly put, 24K Magic the album doesn't disappoint!To anyone who can't understand or doesn't like this album I say, \"Throw some perm on that attitude........you need to relax!!!!\"\n", "val": 0.011780328117311}

From the first spin I was hooked.Reminiscent of Bobby Brown, New Edition, Teddy Riley, New Jack Swing era.Every song can be a single.You'll love it if you don't take yourself too serious.

{"text": "This is the best CD ever.  Actually, that didn't capture what I want to say.  Look, I was coming home from work, and I heard \"That's What I Like\" on the radio.  It was so good that I was instantly pissed that I didn't own the CD to replay it to death.  So, I decided that weekend to get it from Target.  Was it there?  Negative.  How about Best Buy?  Nope.  Then I was like, you know what, screw it, I'll just get it from iTunes.  Now, although I grew up downloading music from the original Napster, in my older age, I prefer to have the actual, physical CD when I want an entire LP.  All that leads me to this week, when, again, I heard that song on the radio.  I woke up Saturday morning determined to buy some Fage Total 0% yogurt from the store, so I added this CD to my \"to buy\" list.  Once I got through the jungle that is Walmart, I still didn't have the damn CD, because, I mean, who wants to buy an actual CD anymore if it's not gospel?  Later on, I went to Barnes & Noble, and there it was--the only copy they had, sitting right next to the vinyls and a million Pop! figurines.Since you've made it this far, let me tell you, this is one of the best CDs I own.  And I'm including Prince's Purple Rain in my assessment, which is incredible.  Buy the actual CD.  The one I got had \"Made in U.S.A\" written on the disc which should give you extra motivation if you live in the States.  But yes, EXCELLENT CD.  Definitely Bruno's best.

I'm not necessarily a prude but I've always believed one of the reasons for his massive success was that he appealed to people of all ages, from my 8-year-old granddaughter to a former boss in her 70's. However, the majority of the music on this CD is too sexy to listen to with my granddaughter, or for that matter, just about anyone else. A few of the songs are catchy enough to keep in my playlist for a while but this CD is not, in my opinion, any where close to the level of awesomeness as the others I have purchased, even without the overly sexual lyrics.

Bruno cites artists like Babyface, Jam & Lewis, New Edition among others, as the driving force behind this release.  24K MAGIC starts the ball rolling funky style and from there, it's song and song and not a dud in the bunch.  His vocals and style shine thru and thru and just make the most of a release that cheats the listener, because there is only 9 songs here, when it could have been longer.  His groovy side slides thru and his softer side shines just as bright and his voice carries the entire disc with the strength of an artist who has been in the game longer than he actually has been.

{"text": "I don't usually review albums, I just give them stars and move on - but this one kind of took me by surprise. It was sort of an impulse buy after loving '24k magic' and  'Chunky' . So catchy, I just couldn't resist. However, the entire album has really grown on me more than I thought it would. In contrast to the 24k magic jam, the second released single 'Versace on the floor' seemed like an uninteresting M.Jackson knock-off when first released, but before long that back beat and smooth voice won me over ; I can't deny his voice!! (would melt any lady okay?)Songs like 'Thats what I like' are so damn catchy , I know so repetitive, but that choppy punctuated fast verse bleeding into this huge RnB belt out Ballad , what a range ! Bruno is a ballad man, with a ballad voice, but it is fun to hear differnt songs like this.  Last few songs on the album still feel 'older'  90s Rnb to me with their beats (straight up & down). Not digging the Halle B. shout out in lovlies,  seems corny (love the falsetto in that song though!!!) . Final Note: Alright, growing up listening to James Brown, part of me just can't stop listening to 'Perm' without giving praise where praise is do - what a funky throw back to James. You can even hear him call out the band in a signature James way. Just love it. I want to do splits, where enormous flare pants and dance every time I hear this song. My purchase was worth it just so I can play Perm at any time to get up, and get down!\n", "val": 0.00665741553530097}

To the late 80's early 90's r & b that is, Let's get started with the title album track 24K Magic. This song sounds like Zap and The Gap Band had a baby, Perm has a lot of James Brown influences here and my personal favorite is the New Jack Swing song Finesse. This reminds me of Bel Biv Devoe's Poison and old school Bobby Brown. Bruno really out did himself on this album, he never dissapoints and it was worth the four year wait. This album is that good.

This guy spews raw talent that should be highly acknowledged by music lovers of all types! This album to me, showcases Bruno Mars\"s incredible abilities and great talents that you just don't get nowadays.  The album has a mixed feeling that reminds me of the type of music I grew up with (80's baby). Music that had feeling, music that had love, and music that made me want to DANCE! It brought me back to when i first experienced true love, it brought me back to my high school dances, and it brought me back to that groove and funk of my younger years. And at the same time, It is all so new and fresh. The songs do not sound recycled or \"bitten\". Instead it is showcases how the \"legends\" and \"greats\" of the past have influenced a great artist like Bruno Mars to bring beautiful music to the world. I would highly recommend this album to any 80's baby like myself, because Bruno Mars's is of the same era. And he knows GOOD music. Thank you so much Bruno for bringing us BACK such beautiful music!

{"text": "Bruno Mars first came to my attention when I heard \"The Lazy Song\" performed by a local group called The Blast Addicts. It was around the time of the man's second album that I went back to listen to the first. He has a very soulful sound and is a talented songwriter. There were times where he did seem to concentrate on the novelty aspects of his music. Especially when it came to being eclectic. Recently however,he upped the strong 80's boogie/electro funk quotient in his music with his Mark Ronson collaboration \"Uptown Funk\". And with a full live band in tow,this sound became the general template for this new third album of his.\"24k Magic\" starts off the album with a pounding Vocorder/synthesizer based electro funk jam. \"Chunky\" adds a simple but effective electric bass line with more of a lush jazz/funk shuffle about it. \"Perm\" gets into a straight up James Brown type groove with really hit horns. \"Versace On The Floor\" and \"Calling All The Lovelies\" are electronically arranged mid tempo slow jams while the slower \"Straight Up & Down\" and the uptempo \"Finese\" have something I never thought would return: a new jack swing rhythm.  The closer \"Too Good To Say Goodbye\" has an electric sitar based Thom Bell Philly ballad flavor while \"That's What I Like\" has a more hip-hop/trap flavor with a very singable melody.Musically speaking,this album is possibly the best and most consistent Bruno Mars has made thus far. He's primarily exploring mid 80's electro funk on these songs. Yet he also dabbles in musical innovations from later in the decade too. Even the CD label has a retro 80's flavor. Whether recorded with the band or with one or two people,most of the album has a superb flow. Lyrically,the songs are steeped in the good humored party crew mentality. So there no deep songs here. Though some of the ballads have a strong romantic side to them.. In the end,it points mostly to Bruno Mars's musical strengths than anything else. And provides a solid template for the music he has in store for his in the future.\n", "val": 0.020932845771312714}

After getting the full new CD (memento mori), I found their style has become weird and quite different from what I was expecting, having heard this single and liking it.This is simply my opinion, and is no reflection of others' tastes, but to me... they kind of lost me on this album. Maybe I haven't listened to it enough to appreciate it, but it seems more experimental and different than the solid, catchy songs of their previous album/ep's.

{"text": "I'm really disappointed by Flyleaf's new album.I'm a huge fan of their debut and their live shows, and I've realized that they're diehard Christians longtime ago, but I didn't expect this.Memento Mori seems to be a desperate attempt to turn Flyleaf fans into religious fanatics. So unfortunately it's definitely not suitable for non-religious people as opposed to their first album.The vocals are as beautiful as always, the music kind of simple, not very interesting. Memento Mori seems to be all about the message of the songs. Beautiful lyrics made room for simple phrases in order to help everyone understand what this is really about: God, Jesus, martyrs.Pathetic.\n", "val": 6.767860759282485e-05}
{"text": "Four years ago the world got a taste of a CD that only comes around every so often. It's even rarer when that CD is a band's debut album. Enter Flyleaf, the quintet rocker show with a female vocalist who can do things with her voice that others could only dream of. Who could forget the opening song of the album \"Flyleaf\" - a little song called \"I'm So Sick\". A rumbling bass background, followed by Lacey Mosley's beautiful singing voice one second, then a vicious and monstrous scream by the same singer; it led to an 11 track musical adventure that still provides good listening four years after it's release.Now, we have \"Memento Mori\". Flyleaf's second full-fledged album was under much anticipation, to put it mildly. Does it deliver in a way that will satisfy both the fans and the critique of musicians alike? \"Yes\" can be attributed to the former, but the latter is of good question.The first thing that must be said about this CD is that Flyleaf and Howard Benton but an incredible amount of creativity into this CD. Each song is unique, and although the hardness of Flyleaf that we are used to is still there, it has taken a much more experimental form. Lacey only screams during one song (\"Swept Away\"), but the new singing techniques you will find in \"Chasm\", \"This Kind\", \"Circle\", and others will show that screaming is not Lacey's only strong suit. The rest of the band contributed very solid recording in \"Beautiful Bride\", \"This Close\", \"Set Apart This Dream\", \"Uncle Bobby\" - there honestly isn't a bad song on this CD, and it is very pleasing to the ears.With that being said, there is a recurring problem found in this CD. For example, this version (Amazon MP3 Exclusive Deluxe Version) features 20 songs. Normally we don't complain about a CD with that number of songs - but in this case 20 songs hurts the overall quality of the CD. While the sound of \"Flyleaf\" was very straightforward, both musically and lyrically, this CD is very complicated on the music and lyric front. Honestly, while listening through it, the songs were all great, but didn't impact me as much as the simplicity of the songs in \"Flyleaf\". There is so much experimentation and deepness of the music that its almost too much, and 20 songs compound this problem more than I would like. Also, Lacey's singing in some songs will make it hard, sometimes even impossible, to sing along with her.Is this a good CD? Yes. Does Flyleaf deliver? Yes. Is it as good/better than the first CD? No. Fans will eat it up, and it is a great listen, as well as having stellar production quality and creativity - just take this one with a grain of salt. Enjoy it, but embrace slight disappointment as a possibility.\n", "val": 0.007691931910812855}

I like the musical style too. I know that the overtly Christian lyrics my be a bit of a turn off to some of the band's non-Christian fans, they are the opposite for me. I love my savior Jesus Christ, and what he has done for me, and I love how Flyleaf expresses that they feel the same way. Give this record a try.

{"text": "Four years after the release of their highly successful self-titled album, the most prominent Christian rock band from Texas -- Flyleaf -- have reunited with producer Howard Benson to dish out their long-awaited sophomore effort, \"Memento Mori.\" While the first album had more of a garage band edge to it, the follow-up finds the band shedding away some of their punkier second-rate Nirvana influences in favor for a much more polished and radio-ready sound. This should come as no surprise though, as Flyleaf are one of those rare rock bands nowadays who can sell a record and since their debut was a bit raw and immature.Touring heavily with the likes of Korn and Disturbed has done little to soften the band's strong Christian themes. In fact, on \"Memento Mori,\" such moments are much clearer than ever. For some this could be a turn-off, but for the (ahem) faithful followers, it may be a plus. Put plain and simple, Lacey loves Jesus and wants to make sure you know all about it. Putting that aside, though, the album is certainly a notch above the first as far as musicianship goes. While the band has yet to establish a distinctive style, they back up Lacey's broad themes and unique voice well, and Benson's improved production only serves to give the whole affair more bombast and sonic improvements. Put simply, this is the same Flyleaf you know already, just marginally improved and perfected.If \"Memento Mori\" has one fatal flaw, though, it's that the songs tend to blend into one another without a single moment sticking out. While there isn't necessarily a bad song to be found, it can be an overall taxing album to listen to and certainly begs the question of whether or not it will continue Flyleaf's string of success. At the end of the day, their second effort improves on almost all fronts, leaving memorable song-writing on the back-burner. Chalk it up to a burnt-out producer (seriously, what album HASN'T Howard Benson produced this year?) and a slightly immature band. Hopefully album number three irons out some of the wrinkles, but in the meantime, this will suffice.The deluxe edition features four bonus tracks: \"Break Your Knees,\" \"Enemy,\" \"Have We Lost\" and \"Who Am I\". \"Break Your Knees\" and \"Have We Lost\" sound like it would fit right in with the first album, while \"Enemy\" meanders along rather blandly. \"Who Am I,\" on the other hand, sticks out and would probably make a good single -- if it weren't for the fact that it is so short. These tracks are worth owning for the fans who can't get enough of the band, but don't neccessarily improve the album as a whole. Take 'em or leave 'em.\n", "val": 0.007709701079875231}

On Momento Mori, Flyleaf goes into full on christian rock mode, with practically every song heavy in religious overtones.  For this non-believer, it's just too much.

At first I was a bit disappointed with this record. The songs tend to be slower paced and there isn't as much gutteral passion in the vocals as there is on Flyleaf  (and its lacking Lacey's screams -- which I really miss) I found myself really missing that sort of passion. Had I reviewed this record a week after its release, I probably would have given it three stars at best. However, over the past couple of months of listening to it, it has really grown on me and now I like it as a solid recording on its own. Like I said earlier, it is not as raw and loud as the first album (and I don't find the songs to be as catchy and the lyrics are a bit more abstract), but it is a good album in its own right and if you are a fan of the band you should give it a chance and I'm sure you will come to love it.

{"text": "Well well well, another modern rock band on the list. Does this mean that the genre is coming back around after five years of boring? Maybe. We'll see what 2010 brings us. In the meantime, let's take a look at Flyleaf's second album. I never checked out their last album, except the singles that I heard here and there, which I always thought were pretty good. This album is interesting but also not. Interesting in the sense that some of the tracks are AMAZING and some are just good. For instance, the opener \"Beautiful Bride\" hits you hard from the get-go, lets up during the verse with a creative rhythm guitar lick, and then cranks back into a driving chorus with an awesome hook. However, tracks like \"In The Dark,\" \"Set Apart,\" and \"Swept Away\" just good.Like I said though, there are some really great songs on the album. \"Again,\" the album's second track and lead single, also features very cool guitar work and beautiful vocal melodies by front-woman Lacey Mosley, whose voice I must admit isn't for everyone. I can see how some people find it annoying and yes, at certain moments, I feel the same way. However, the majority of the time, she shines and I feel the complete opposite. Take the third track \"Chasm,\" for instance. This is another great representation of not only Mosley's vocal abilities, but also her range in styles, as well as the band's.Other stand-out tracks include \"Missing,\" a haunting and beautiful track anchored by a trifecta of guitar melody, wonderfully poetic lyrics, and bone-chilling vocals. \"This Close\" follows a different path, but also contains all three of these elements that make them great songs. Of all the album's tracks, however, \"Tiny Heart,\" might be the most brilliant, with it's interesting 10/12 time signature (I think that's what it is) during the chorus, which, interestingly enough, catches you by surprise by smashing in after the first bar of what you THOUGHT was the chorus, but was actually a pre-chorus, which (also interesting to note) WAS the chorus on the original 2003 recording of the song. This is a simply brilliant trick that helped this record really stand out from the rest of the crop this year.\n", "val": 0.029631365090608597}

But I just don't find myself walking around bursting out suddenly into song with a great Flyleaf chorus or bridge, yet all my 4- and 5-star bands get this treatment from me.  So Flyleaf has not achieved what I am looking for in them just yet, and I think the radio play will ultimately agree.A better band to choose right now for this type of genre is the band 'Paramore.'

Unfortunately that was the peak of the band's strength, which they throw out right at the start - \"Beautiful Bride\", the amazing \"Again\", \"Chasm\" and \"In The Dark\" all great strong songs where their biggest asset, namely Lacey, shines. What we're left with after that is an only decent second half of calmer and less daring melodies, proving that one masterpiece and a few strong songs can't save an entire album. And while this is definitely worth hearing, I'd advise a test listen before you go ahead and order the album. The bonus tracks aren't much to cheer about, and if you want to be able to listen to this on your iPod, the pre-grap track \"Uncle Bobby\" is impossible to rip on certain DVD-drives, which is a real shame.

There is still the moments of all out hard rock (Beautiful Bride, Again, The Kind) but now we see Flyleaf flirting more with melody and actual singing than before (In The Dark, Set Apart This Dream, Treasure) and it works in their favor for the most part. I'll be honest, the only song I skip over is Missing and I wouldn't necessarily call that a bad song even. I'm not oblivious to the fact that this CD isn't perfect though. I understand it's not, but it's as close as Flyleaf was gonna get after a four year absence.There's been a lot of gripe about the lyrics this time around. I can't really understand why, Flyleaf is open in admitting they are a CHRISTIAN band (go to a concert of theirs, that'll prove it), hence the blatant religious lyrics in a lot of songs. As for the others, Lacey hasn't been shy about talking about how she got married during Flyleaf's abscence, hence the songs like Treasure and so on. I accepted those facts before hearing Memento Mori, maybe that's why I still enjoy this CD so much. What aids their case also is the liner notes in the booklet. I opened it anticipating reading the lyrics, but no. Instead you're greeted with a story of sorts about a girl leaving one (bad) 'army' to join the other (good) army. It's obvious they're talking about the constant fight between good and evil, but it was something that helped me make sense of some songs.All in all, this is still Flyleaf.

Four brand new songs is reason enough. The fact that two of the four are simply incredible only helps. Have We Lost, again sees Flyleaf treading somewhat unfamiliar ground in which Lacey's voice soars through the chorus. And the other would be Who Am I. For the most part Who Am I is kind of downtrodden but the chorus is extremely heartfelt. All four songs sport great lyrics (if you appreciated those featured on the CD itself), so come on, you can't go wrong.\n", "val": 0.008841210044920444}

{"text": "I usually don't take the time to review things, but something in some of the reviews I was reading about Memento Mori gave me the incentive.After reading that one reviewer found the lyrics in Memento Mori meaningless, well...I have found a lot of the lyrics very inspiring, with all of the harsh truthfulness that Christian rock bands usually have, and minus the hopeless despair that secular heavy metal usually has. A person who finds \"Beautiful Bride\" meaningless is someone who doesn't personally understand the Christian life. The body of Christ which is represented in the church, and the unity it should have, etc.Also, songs like \"This Close,\" which is coming from the perspective of someone who doesn't know Christ, with lyrics that tell about a person's spiritual deadness, and what will eventually happen to them unless they come to Christ carry deep meaning. Flyleaf's prerogative IS NOT for a person from a religion apart from Christianity to find meaning in the lyrics as far as their own personal religious experience goes. Christianity's experience is different from any other religion, and I imagine it would be going against everything Flyleaf stands for to have a Buddhist find the same meaning in their lyrics as a Christian would.\"Had a dream that we were dead, but we pretended that we still lived.With no regrets we never bled and we took everything life could giveAnd came up broken empty handed in the endIn the hearts of the blind, something you'll never find is a vision of lightWith the voice of the dead, I'm screaming\"So, basically my entire point for this review is that the beauty in Memento Mori is largely in the lyrics, and if you can't relate to those, this Cd won't speak to you nearly as much as it does to me. I was not disappointed with this CD, and it is definitely better in every way than their previous CD. The only real downside is that the style of most of the songs are the same and sound kind of the same. I would like to see them expand in the diversity of sound in their next album, but overall, high praise.\n", "val": 0.0012708851136267185}
{"text": "Flyleaf crashed into our airways in 2005 with their blend of metal and Christian rock. Lacey's unpredicted screams and roars set the pace for a new kind of band to take the stage.  A band with a message and a purpose is hard to find these days. Their brutal lyrics and raw honesty sets them apart from previous bands. Lacey is small and tiny with a big voice.  Some people are disappointed by their latest efforts \"Memento Mori,\" because they use the word \"Christ\" or \"Jesus\" too often, but keep in mind that has been their message since the beginning in 2005 and 2007 releases. At least they are being honest and not fake about their faith.  If your a true fan you won't be disappointed by their new success.1. Beautiful Bride- The most energetic song in the album and yes Lacey does sing the words \"Body of Christ\" in this song, which makes the song even more captivating.  5/52. Again- This song is suited for the radio, since it has a great hook and the drums in this song are what makes it stand alone. 4/53. Chasm- I love the beginning part of this song so much,and the rest of it is good too. I can relate to this song very much. 4/54. Missing- This is one of my favorites. I don't care who you are, but anyone who had their heart broken can find comfort in this song. It shows Flyleaf's more sentimental side. 5/55. So close- This song is a bit strange lyrically, but after listening to it a few times it grows on you. It has a a catchy hook. 4/56. The Kind- I love this song! Lacey has some attitude in this song. The lyrics can be interpreted in many ways. The song actually stops for Lacey to say \" You can't serve God and Money.\"  Its a fast moving song. 5/57. In the Dark- This is my very song on the album. This shows Flyleaf's dark side, and she does let out a roaring scream in the end. Similar to their 2005 debut but a lot better. 5/58. Set Apart this dream- This showcases Lacey's voice. She sounds like a little girl in this song.  One of the slower songs. The lyrics are very descriptive and pretty. 4/59. Swept Away- This song is similar to \"In the Dark\", mostly because Lacey lets out her famous scream again. It's a beautiful song. 5/510. Tiny Heart- The chorus is a bit awkward, but it still is worth a listen. It's a touching song. 4/511. Treasure- This song is about how her husband proposed to her, and its romantic. Lacey said that in an interview. She felt \"treasured.\" 4/512. Circle- This is another one of my favorites. It's about Christ and how he died on the cross for us. The best part is at the very end. 5/513. Arise- Saved the best for last. Great inspirational song. Sounds even better in concert. 5/5Flyleaf did a great job on this record. Even if your not a Christian you will still love it. The songs have so much meaning in them. I admire their strong faith. Must listen to \"In the dark\" \"The Kind\".\n", "val": 0.01819658651947975}
{"text": "I've been a longtime Flyleaf fan, even back to their earlier stuff when they were known as Passerby. I had huge expectations for this album, and in every way they delivered. The first time I played the album, I liked it a lot - But each time I played it, I fell more in love with it. I was hoping for something a little bit harder at times, but musically there is so much substance and diversity. Lacey has learned how to use her incredible voice much better over the last couple years, and it shows in this album. The rest of the band as well though, all stand out in a musicality much more developed than their debut album. Memento Mori will forever be one of my favorite modern albums.I do have to say though - There are a lot of reviews on here criticizing the badn for their faith being more upfront in this album compared to the last. What people fail to understand is that Flyleaf has always kept their faith upfront. Unfortunately with their first major release, the band was essentially forced to sacrifice some of that. As pretty much a no-name band at the time, they were naive in the industry and were really looking to others to lead them. As they grew in the industry, and as the success of their album skyrocketed, they earned the right (and learned) that they have much more say in what happens in the studio. The large majority of people don't realize that recording an album is not, 'hey... here's our song. Let's record it now.' You have producers and labels saying 'You need to change this' or 'do that' or 'this won't work,' etc. Flyleaf was determined that they would not let this happen the second time around. Bottom line is that this time around, they put out the music and songs that were more fully genuine to who they are. That should command respect, irrelevant of whether one shares the same faith or not.\n", "val": 0.006313202902674675}

{"text": "There's a sort of curse with bands, particularly with any group whose debut album was a rousing success: the second album will either rise to new heights, or it will fall dauntingly short of the initial effort. Flyleaf opted wholeheartedly for the second option, as \"Memento Mori\" proves that everything that made their self-titled debut successful was lost during the long hiatus between albums.Where are the meaningful lyrics, the passion of Lacey's vocals, the power behind the chords and the inspiration running through the metal chords? These are merely a few of the questions any listener asks themselves when listening to \"Memento Mori.\" The album opens up on the new single \"Beautiful Bride,\" a meaningless song that seems, from the music video, to be about a woman walking down a church aisle toward her husband.Now, I understand that Flyleaf is a secular-Christian band, and that none of the band members are ashamed of their religion. I respect that. I'm not a Christian, but in their previous faith-based songs (think \"Cassie\" and \"Red Sam\") a member of any religion could find meaning and power, particularly in the two I mentioned. \"Beautiful Bride\" beats you over the head with the Christian-only marriage metaphor, Lacey's vocals are simplistic and lose the passion of the initial album, and the chords are uninspired and repetitious. This is, sadly, only a glimpse of what's to come.\"Again\" is a powerful song that hearkens back to the previous heights Flyleaf is capable of attaining. \"Chasm\" and \"Missing\" follow this formula, with \"Missing\" in particular being a showcase of the lyrical power that this group can attain when working together. \"This Close\" is a dark yet hopeful song,  leading into the powerful vocals of \"The Kind,\" which seems to be a song about the emptiness of sex these days. These tracks were a return to form and they were lovely and inspiring to listen to.\"In the Dark\" is a step down, but it's still interesting enough to keep you listening. Next we have the unfortunate and childish \"Set Apart This Dream,\" a little would-be ballad about a little girl spinning an imaginary world in the twirls of her dress. Disney, perhaps, but not Flyleaf. \"Swept Away\" does little to redeem the album, coming closer to \"In the Dark\" than anything from the stronger tracks. \"Tiny Heart\" is exactly like it sounds: it has little heart and little meaning, and is in the same immature vein as \"Set Apart This Dream.\"We move on from these unfortunate tracks to an equally if not more so \"Interlude,\" a useless little intro to the next song that only eats up album space and patience. \"Treasure\" has all of the qualities of \"Tiny Heart\" and keeps this album spinning into mediocrity.\"Circle,\" however, finally starts to lift this album back up to where the potential lay in the opening tracks, and the album ends on \"Arise,\" a triumphant song that is a worthy addition to Flyleaf's set list. \"Arise\" is such a strong ending track that it almost redeems the latter half of the album - but only almost, and as we all know in music, almost doesn't count. The bonus track for the original album is a silly little song called \"Uncle Bobby\" that has no meaning and even worse and obvious lyrics than several other songs on this album. It tries to achieve the same power as \"I'm Sorry\" or \"Sorrow\" from Flyleaf's original album but it fails miserably, ending the album on a low note after the highs of \"Arise.\"DELUXE EDITION BONUS DISCThe deluxe edition of \"Memento Mori\" contains a second disc of five tracks, or six if you download the extra song from iTunes or some other provider. The bonus disc is a powerful, beautiful collection of five songs that contained everything that \"Memento Mori\" lacked: power, passion, integrity, and inspiration. *Why* couldn't these songs have been used in the actual album?\"Break Your Knees\" is a powerful opener that slams through the listener with power and passion and ferocity in equal measure. \"Enemy\" is a thoughtful acoustic/metal mash-up that offers an insightful look at enemies within and without oneself. \"Have We Lost\" and \"Who Am I\" are both dark, introspective tracks that resonate with meaning and with vocals that regain all the passion lost on the main disc.The final track is \"Stay (Faraway, So Close),\" a masterful acoustic cover of the classic U2 ballad which Lacey Moseley absolutely smashes out of the park, lending the lyrics power and also a sort of joy which is lost in the original. It's a strong ending to essentially an EP that is stronger, better, and much more memorable than the album that spawned it.The bonus track for this second disc is \"Bitter Sweet,\" an almost eastern-influenced metal song that's rocking on all cylinders with guitars, drum beats, and Lacey's lovely vocal talents lending it the kind of hard metal power that other tracks were missing.Ultimately, \"Memento Mori\" failed as a sophomore album. I'd stop short of calling it awful, but it's a bitter pill to swallow on the heels of Flyleaf's initial efforts which pounded this album into the dirt. The second disc is even harder to listen to because there isn't a bad song on it, and it leaves you scratching your head and wondering how the first disc could fall so short of the mark when it's clear that Flyleaf still has so much potential to work with.\"Memento Mori\" is Latin for 'remember you will die.'

{"text": "I've been a fan of Flyleaf from the beginning, at least a year before their self-titled debut hit stores. It's hard to believe it's already been 4 years, and while the band has enjoyed quite a bit of success, we're only just now getting their sophomore effort. Flyleaf still sounds very much like themselves, the only subtle changes in this record is that it's a bit more polished and \"produced\" than their post-grunge debut album. I've really been enoying this album, but I was disappointed by the fact that it doesn't seem to be quite as strong as their first. On the last album, every song popped! It was one great song after another and each of them stood well on their own. However on this album, half way in all the songs seem to blend together and sound a bit too similar, especially since they're so short. Don't get me wrong, this album does have it's share of winning songs. \"Again\", \"Missing\" and \"Arise\" are some of the best songs the band has ever written, and some of the best tunes of the year. Other songs that I really liked were \"Chasm\", \"This Close\" and \"Swept Away.\" The whole album is good but most of the other songs just kind of run together. It's possible that over time I'll become more familiar with the album and my opinion will change, but I hope the group really steps it up when it comes time for album #3. Still, if you're any kind of Flyleaf fan then I think you'll really enjoy this, and it's still better than anything that Paramore has dished out.\n", "val": 0.015034621581435204}

{"text": "The second offering from Flyleaf is spectacular.  The music fits thematically from song to song, as rock albums should.  The themes, depicted in the cover and album title, are fleshed out in the lyrics and music as the listener progresses through the story line.  Opening with the classic rock song Beautiful Bride, a hopeful view of the Christian church, the next song focuses on the struggles and pain of leadership (within the church).  From there, various themes of those outside the church looking in, to those within the church struggling to stay within the community.  Several of the songs have explicitly Christian themes.  Some are just good life songs, whether Christian or not.  The closing song, Arise, is a very uplifting track and highlights Lacey Mosely's unique, almost haunting, vocal tallents (as does Arise and Set Apart This Dream.)  It is an album that can be consumed song by song without feeling a need to fast forward to the next song anywhere in the 14 tracks.In contrast to the first offering from Flyleaf, which is also an excellent production, this album is better produced.  The musical quality, both vocally and instrumentally is superior.  There are fewer songs that are groundbreaking.  In the first CD, All Around Me, Suffer, Fully Alive and Breathe Today, provide some groundbreaking material.  There are also three or four good songs on that CD.  This sophomore album has fewer groundbreaking songs, Again and Arise, maybe.  However, there are ten other good songs.I don't like that Flyleaf continues to avoid publishing their lyrics, leaving fans to surf the web in search of help.  Not all of the web lyric sites have the words correct and I don't want to work that hard.  One minor complaint, songs 3-7 sound very similar.\n", "val": 0.02420143596827984}
{"text": "Let me start off by saying that I really liked the first Flyleaf album, I bought it on a whim after hearing the single so sick being played in the store.  Since I was looking for something new to play on a road trip this fit the bill nicely.  The album was good a little bit of metal and hard rock with some vague christian references but not in your face.  That being said I was kind of looking forward to hearing the new album after hearing their first single (Again)being played in rotation on the local rock station.  Yet when I listened to the album I was kind of bummed out.  This album has some hard edged songs such as the aforementioned one but most of these songs and the album in general are completely different from the first one.  This album is very very Christian oriented, the lyrics are mostly about god and other christian oriented themes.  Lyrically the songs are good, the music as well, there's not anything super bad about the album but other than the lead single nothing stands out to me.  If you are a Christian fan of Flyleaf than this album will probably be up your alley.  However for the rest of the fans that came to Flyleaf from the first album I would say you might not like this album.  It's not just Christian oriented the songs themselves are very pop oriented way more than the first album.  I'm not gonna get into the whole are they or aren't they a Christian band thing.  I think it's pretty obvious by listening to the album, and that's not a bad thing.  I think however the mainstream fans that got into them off their first record will probably be put off by the preachieness of the lyrics.  Hopefully they will go back to their harder edged sound of the first album but I think that this might be the kind of stuff to expect from them from now on.

{"text": "I went NUTS for the first Flyleaf album!  So much, that I took my oldest daughter on a trip to New York City (on a week night) to see them.  The concert was GREAT!Last month, I took my younger daughter (again, on a week night) to see them again.We were NOT disappointed!  They performed the best tunes from BOTH of their albums.Amazon offered a pre-sale for Momento Mori, which I fully took advantage of.It was so exciting to come home and find the new CD in my mail box.Lacey's voice is as FANTASTIC as ever!  The recording EXCELLENT!  The band, AWESOME!There are four SUPER songs that I listen to over and over and over...A couple of other tunes showcase the lighter side of the band.  They are also very good.I do feel, however, that the other half of the new recordings are not as special.  The band rocks, but the amazing hooks and lyrics (ON EVERY SONG) of the first CD are just not here on every single tune.  (The first CD is a classic A++++).That said, I still recommend you purchase the VERY GOOD, \"Momento Mori\".Better yet:  Catch the BEST OF BOTH ALBUMS by seeing the band in concert!!!!!!!!\n", "val": 0.06905710697174072}
{"text": "Being a big fan of flyleaf, I was quite excited to get their new CD.  What a great album!  It rocks hard, and has a beautiful message.They definitely refined their sound a little in this album; it doens't have quite as much of a \"garage-band\" feel to it.  This is not to say that they have strayed away from their core sound, but just that they touched it up a bit.  I would list off some of the good songs, but there is just too many.If you are a big fan, I reccommend spending the extra couple bucks and buying the deluxe edition.  There are some great songs on that bonus CD that you would otherwise miss out on.\n", "val": 0.01822998933494091}

Especially with Lacey Mosley's past, it's inspiring that someone with a past so dark could really become someone like this. Despite the fact that this album is more geared towards the religious aspect than the others have been (I'm referring to the fact that the lyrics actually come right out and talk about religion in this album) but it hasn't stopped me from playing it over and over again for the past couple days.

They're great bands.I just cant relate when the lyrics really mention christ and jesus by name.I am not a christian hater by any means. just not an album for me, and i am disappointed that they went this route.There's a difference with this album versus their previous effort and other christian bands. Their previous album as well as recent albums done by Red and Skillet contain music that speaks to you about hard times, relationships, happy times, etc. and it explains how their spirituality helped them make it through.Memento Mori does not do that. It is simply an album that preaches to you. Believe or your life is worth nothing.........\n", "val": 0.0006836519460193813}
{"text": "Let me begin by explaining that this may be a totally bias review of this album as Flyleaf are my favourite artists and I consider them to be the greatest gift to music that has ever existed.  If you can get past that fact then here is my review.  Memento Mori is the sophomore album from flyleaf that has been 4 years in the making.  The previous EP's and the debut album were all received very well by fans and critics a-like and perhaps by the time the \"Much like falling EP\" was released in 2007 you could begin to pin a certain style to Flyleaf's music.  This album however totally dismisses that statement as the style has completely shifted making for a much more mature and complex album full of diversity.  Where as the debut felt like a collection of songs, this album feels like a complete album with little interludes throughout and a powerful message.  Memento Mori comes from the Latin phrase meaning \"be mindful of death\" or \"remember you will die\" and this theme is prominent throughout the album.01  - Beautiful Bride - Outstanding take-off for the album.  Guitar, bass and drum work on 100% and a unbelievable vocal melody.  This track really sets the theme of Memento Mori and prepares you for the rest of the album.  10/1002  - Again -  The snare! James battering the snare drum on this song really makes this such a powerful track.  That along with lyrics such as \" Here you are down on your knees again / trying to find air to breathe again. Only surrender will help you now\" makes this song so immensely almighty.  An Incredibly uplifting track and not only one of the best songs on the album, but one of my personal favourite songs of all time.  10/1003  - Chasm - \"I'm so thirsty, I'm so thirsty\".  This track is for the flyleaf fans that like that hardness in their songs. Superbly built track.  10/1004  - Missing - I believe pat wrote this one.  A very unexpected change in style on this with some extraordinary vocals from Lacey and is one of the stand-out tracks from the album.  Producer Howard Benson also used various techniques on this which have not been used on a flyleaf record before and these complement the track so well.  10/1005  - This Close -  Such a beautiful track.  Definably sticking with the Memento Mori theme.  The track beings with an evil-esque sounding guitar and builds up to a powerful chorus.  10/1006  - The Kind - This track kind of came out of nowhere.  A serious message in this song which builds to a tremendous finale. Truth after truth after truth after truth after truth after truth... enough said.  This song is spectacular.  I image it would very difficult for some to listen to as it may relate to them more so than they would like.  10/1007  - In The Dark - Another reason why Memento Mori is far superior to their previous album. The intro is very reminiscent of \"danger - keep away\" from Slipknot's \"Subliminal Verses\" very slow and sets such a tremendous atmosphere which builds to an incredibly breath-taking climax with some fantastic guitar riffs.  10/1008  - Set Apart This Dream - If you listen to this song be prepared to be singing it for the rest of the day.  This track was inspired by the Christian self-help book Wild at Heart and that must of been some book because this song is electrifying. The melodies are like nothing i have ever heard and Sameer's guitar work complements this track so splendidly.  10/1009  - Swept Away - Reminiscent of \"I'm so sick\" from there debut album.  It is astonishing how something sounding this demented can be about God. \"Spread out your open handsAnd He will raise you up\".  Some crazy sounds, yelling and repetition that all leads to a very strange little interlude at the end of the track with a music box.  Very creative 10/1010  - Tiny Heart - If you are a serious fan of Flyleaf the you will without a doubt of already heard a previous recorded version of this song from their \"Passerby\" days.  A few bits of re-arrangement, re-written lyrics and the the addition of a piano makes this song a small improvement on an already perfect track.  The arrangement of the chorus may be hard to follow at first but it grows on you.  10/1011  - Melting (Interlude) - this interlude really does feel like the mould of what an album should be is effectively \"melting\" as the album prepares for a serious musical shift and really brings home the Memento Mori message hard.12  - Treasure -  This track is about how Lacey was proposed to and is incredible.  The addition of dialogue is somewhat unexpected but works well on the track.  10/1013  - Circle -  Oh man!  From what I can decipher from the lyrics this entire song is about Jesus.  After listening to it I dare anyone to say that their soul doesn't feel \"heavy\" as such.  Lacey's vocals cut like a knife throughout and even if you do not believe in the message it is delivering I still think you will find something deep for yourself within this song.  10/1014  - Arise - This may sound \"clich&eacute;\" but they have most definitely saved the best song till last.  The track starts almost instantly and you can almost certainly tell this song is going to take you somewhere else.  Pat gets to shine on the bass for the verses and the bridge begins to show signs of excellency. \"Hold ooooonnnnnn\" sung so beautifully by Lacey sounds so perfect on the chorus as they repeat this verse, bridge, chorus structure and eventually delve into something tremendously momentous and meaningful - \"ARISE AND BE - ALL THAT YOU DREAMED - ALL THAT YOU DREAMED\" the single most compellingly almighty line of lyricism delivered impeccably that I have ever had the chance to hear. My review can never do not do this song justice and it could perhaps be the greatest song ever delivered if you are open enough to accept  its significance.  A billion/10\n", "val": 0.04098137840628624}

{"text": "I feel like this album is showing it's counterpart up.  I think they have really moved forward in there song writing abilities.  And what I mean by that is they have found a way to incorporate what it means to be a follower of Christ into the lyrics.  They are a Christian band and were from the start.  There first album had a lot of lyrics that dealt with them confronting there sin and they pain of life.  Most people can relate to that.  This new album is more about glorifying God which is a stretch for most of flyleaf's fans base.  I have been waiting for this new album for awhile and five years is awhile.

{"text": "Every so often, I come across an album that excites me more and more as I listen to each song for the first time and leaves a smile on my face when it's over.  This is one of those albums.\"Memento Mori\" is a concept album that explores light and dark and reminds the listener to live while being mindful of death.  It should come as no surprise then, given knowledge of the band members' faiths, that the lyrics have a strong Christian theme running through them.  While Flyleaf's debut had its share of Christian references, they are much more pronounced and in abundance on this album.  The lyrics are meaningful, deep, honest, and blunt.  You won't find them in the CD booklet.  Instead, the booklet contains a series of journal entries (one for each song) that give insight into the meanings behind the songs, written from the point of view of the commander of an army.The album is full of original, infectious melodies that have enough variety to carry it through from beginning to end without it becoming boring.  There is a nice balance of heavier and lighter rock.  The songs are arranged well, starting with an upbeat anthem and ending with a hopeful and haunting closer.  Lacey pours her soul into every song she sings.  It's clear that the band put a lot of effort into the album, and it paid off.Although I purchased the deluxe edition of the album, I decided to base my rating only on the main album so I wouldn't have to deduct any stars from the final score for the mini-CD.  The extra four-song CD isn't bad, but it's nothing special.  It lacks the creativity and diversity of the main album, and doesn't really warrant the hassle of having to pop it into the CD player after the main album is finished.  It sounds more like a mini b-sides album with its somewhat forgettable melodies.  I was also unable to download the songs from it into my iTunes library (though I did not deduct any stars because of this, since I don't know whose fault this is).  Unless you are a serious fan of the band, I would recommend the regular version of \"Memento Mori\" over the deluxe version.\n", "val": 0.0045258160680532455}
{"text": "I am so proud of this band! These people don't label themselves a \"Christian band\" because they don't believe in playing the God card as a means of making money. Just like most amazing artists/musicians out there, they lay out their lives through music. Why else write, if its not true to you? Music is suppose to be our outlet and our way of getting what matters most to us out without speaking. It truly reflects the heart. And this is their heart, so they really can't NOT talk about God. But they don't sing about God for the sake of money. That's why they don't promote themselves as Christian. You only know that through their lives that they graciously share with us. It upsets me to read the negative comments people leave about what this band has to say through their music, and how they want to just listen to it for their own enjoyment, without hearing \"all this hypocrisy\" as one person put it. What about the band's outlet? Why should they have to write about things that are a lie to them. This album is their truth, it's The Truth! And because of that, they have enough love for people, to at least try to open their eyes and bring hope. Which is more than many care to do. It always seems that whenever God is placed into the equation, people are told to shut up, or what they're saying is offensive. But when it's all about darkness no one says a word. They are praised for digging so deep to get those raw feelings. When really, it doesn't deserve any praise. Life is dark! Everyone struggles with the negative emotions, so it's nothing special or new. People tend to want to sit in that mindset, so they are really just praising those people for keeping them there. What should be praised is when people like the members of Flyleaf dig as deep as they have, that they find themselves digging towards the top of the other side. They know and enlighten others that there is something worth fighting for, and encourage us to keep digging through the dirt of our lives. They know the best way to come out clean is to completely sift through the mess, but they don't leave us there to do it alone. They bring people to the One waiting to wash all the dirt off once we make it through. How on earth is that offensive? It's comforting to know I am still so loved even if I am a mess! The only reason someone would be offended by what they have to say is because they don't want to fight and they don't want to know the Truth because ignorance is bliss, right? Then you're not held accountable. That's how it is in life, if you didn't know then it's not your fault. But unfortunately at the end of this race, we all will be held accountable and no one will be excused for simply \"not knowing\". I encourage everyone of us to open our minds a bit, and really take to heart what is exposed on this album because just by listening to it you have been made aware of the true \"Commander\" aka \"Comforter\" and will be held accountable for what you do or don't do with that knowledge. So stop complaining, and be thankful that you are loved this much, that God used a band He knew YOU loved to shed a little light on the subject. He came to you through your music, that's how much you matter to Him. He wants to see you at the finish line so you can finally just collapse in His arms after such a long, hard race. Life is hard with Him, so why make it any harder without Him? And thanks to Flyleaf for such honesty and strength in this album! It was well worth the wait!! Much love and many blessings!Jamy\n", "val": 0.0016095289029181004}
{"text": "Didn't know what to expect with this one,but it proved to be worth the wait. I enjoyed their self-titled release very much. This one to me continues the sound from that album with a few twists. I don't get involved much with a bands identity. Whether it's Christian,Buddhist,Mongolian or not. I always see reviews which only talk about a bands religious views. This is music,not a religious channel. Anyway,from beginning to end,the songs rock and you have a ballad or two. Great combo. to me. I like variety and they don't disappoint here. If you liked their previous work,why not try Memento Mori. You will enjoy and be rocked out~~~~~\n", "val": 0.023506619036197662}

There was some speculation that they may have been a Christian Rock outfit, but I'm pretty sure I remember reading that they shrugged that off and claimed they weren't.I picked up the expanded edition of their new CD after only hearing \"Again\" once. WHAT HAPPENED?! The CD opens with \"Beautiful Bride,\" which is a song about the Body of Christ. The rest of the CD seems slow compared to their earlier work.

{"text": "Memento Mori delivers in every aspect of the word. Lacey has extremely captivating and dynamic vocal capabilities. Her passionate voice is matched by crisp yet edgy musicianship and simple but compelling lyrics. It is obvious that Christ is the center of Lacey's life, but the lyrics are never clich or preachy.  The one song I feel should have been taken out from the album was Tiny Heart, which is essentially a pop song that does not fit with the rest of the songs. Treasure is really the only time the album slows down, but it is a beautiful ballad. The rest of the album is hard rock at its finest. Amazing vocals are accompanied by soaring or heavy guitars and anthemic drums. Although this album has enough singles to last another four years, I honestly hope we don't have to wait that long to hear their next album.

{"text": "Hello, everyone. Let me tell you about how \"For Real\" this new Flyleaf record is. I'm by no means a Flyleaf \"fanboy\" but I'm definitely a fan, especially since the release of Memento Mori. I was not expecting much from this band, honestly. Many GREAT bands have had terrible sophomore albums. I read as many reviews as I could find about this album, and it seemed like a lot of undeserved criticism was thrown at it, mainly from non-Christian people who try to make this band out to be something that it is not... a secular band. This has to be the breakout album of the year for Christian music. Memento Mori is not a CD that will take multiple listens to get into. From the first playthrough you will notice... the music is Awesome! It is apparent that great care was put into this effort. Lacey's voice is simply tremendous throughout each song (I wish there was more of her wailing like in \"Flyleaf\" but that's just me...) The lyrics are honest, deep, and meaningful... and if you bought the CD, in the liner notes are explanations of each song, the thoughts that were transformed into the lyrics. Very neat. If you enjoyed the album \"Flyleaf,\" make sure you don't miss out on Memento Mori. This record will rock your face off. Keep in mind that the band has removed their \"we are a Christ-centered band trying to make music for everyone\" facade, and busted out their faith in a big way. In closing, I want to make it known that the 5-star rating wasn't given lightly. Compared to their debut, \"Flyleaf\" and other CD's I've purchased this year, this disc is the tip of the iceburg. I hope this review helps you if you are thinking about picking it up.\n", "val": 0.024627061560750008}

The Christian influence was there but subtle, serving as a background for the music to unfold.  I respect people's faith and the influence it has on their work.  But I've seen the interviews where Lacey is touting they're a rock band, not a Christian rock band.  So not true.  This is rock music with in-your-face Jesus lyrics.  \"Beautiful Bride, Body of Christ\" ends with the Hallelujah chorus.  You can't get more openly Christian rock band than a lead track like that.  I'm Christian.  I understand faith.  I just appreciate honesty.  This is a Christian rock band, no longer just with hints of influence, but straight up revival music.

{"text": "I have been waiting for new Flyleaf music forever, and they definately do not disappoint. I've had many experiences where I fall in love with an album and then the next one comes and it's not as good, but I would say that Memento Mori is better than Flyleaf. Lacey's vocals have definately improved, and the band can pull off a hardcore metal song just as easily as a beautiful lullaby. The words are so poetic and meaningful. It is a bit slower than Flyleaf, but definately fast enough to stay interesting (and this comes from a person who easily gets bored with constant slow music). This has become one of my new favorite albums of all time.Beautiful Bride - 4/5 - An energetic opener, reflecting the message of the album very well and it has a great message (\"unite and fight all division\").Again - 4/5 - The first single of the album. It is probably a subject that any Christian can relate to, watching a loved one waste their life away and wishing they would come to Christ. It is a good song with a catchy tune.Chasm - 4/5 - This song is...interesting. I'm still not really sure what to think of it yet. The melody is cool. It's short but packed with energy. The \"ohs\" towards the end of the song sound awesome, and show off Lacey's amazing range.Missing - 5/5 - I think everyone can relate to this song, about trying to find something to fulfill you because it feels like something's missing. It's a bit slower, but very radio-friendly. It's not cliche though; the verses are really poetic.This Close - 5/5 - Wow, I love this song! The lyrics are sad but cool. The melody is very pretty. I don't really know what else to say about it but it's a favorite of mine.The Kind - 4/5 - This is one of the most intese songs on the album in my opinion, which is saying a lot for this album. It talks about how sex before marriage (and sinning in general) is going against God, and the fact that people who call themselves Christians do these horrible things while knowing it's wrong, and don't really talk about it. Towards the end the person repents. The very last part is Lacey repenting. It's a fast song, full of energy.In the Dark - 3/5 - I'm not a fan of the intro of this song. Once it gets going, though, it's pretty good. Lacey does the screams she is known for in the background, which of course adds to the intensity. The drumming is cool in this song.Set Apart this Dream - 5/5 - This song is beautiful, comparable to So I Thought from Flyleaf. It's very dreamy and gives me shivers at its beauty. This is a song that should be sung to every girl, because they deserve it (\"close your eyes, pretty girl/cause it's easier when you brace yourself/set your thoughts on a world far off/where we only cry from joy\"). Lacey is amazing at writing songs that give breathtaking visuals, and this song is a great example of that.Swept Away - 4.5/5 - I couldn't decide whether to give this song a 4 or a 5. The verses are spoken more than sung and are very creepy, but then the chorus comes and, in a melody full of hope, urges the person to accept Christ. It almost seems like the two don't fit together. It is a song that proves how amazing God's love is, because the verses describe someone who seems completely consumed by Satan, but then the chorus says that God will accept the person (\"look at the healing come\").Tiny Heart - 5/5 - This song is slow and pretty, but slow is a relative word for Flyleaf because it still has the electric guitars and energetic chorus. It is from God's point of view, asking a person to accept him in his patient and loving manner. The melody seems pretty straightforward, but with a bit of a twist to keep it interesting.Treasure - 5/5 - This song is haunting and absoutely beautiful, with a wonderful message, that we are \"treasured over all the earth\" by God. It describes the beautiful love He has for us. The intro is amazing: \"Can I tell you a story, as we dance as the sun starts to bleed?\" It starts out slow but then, of course, the guitars kick in. This song is perfect in every way except the way she pronounces \"Yeshua\", which I can easily overlook.Circle - 5/5 - The message in this song is, again, full of hope and love. It is, more specifically, in awe about how Christ would die for us when we've done nothing to deserve it. It is a slowish song but the melody is great. The ending hook is breathtakingly beautiful, and I'm glad that it is repeated multiple times. The very end where Lacey sings it a capella is the perfect ending.Arise - 5/5 - The intro isn't my favorite (she starts singing right away without an instrumental intro) but other than that this song is amazing. I feel like I'm being repetitive about how great these songs are, but it's true. This song is full of hope that people who can relate to songs like Missing and Chasm need to hear. Again, the ending hook is repeated over and over, and Lacey sings it a capella at the very end, much like Circle. I love this; her voice is amazing and I don't think anyone can feel hopeless or alone after this song. It's that powerful.Uncle Bobby - 2/5 - This is probably my least favorite song on the album. It just does not stand out for me. It is slow and the melody doesn't keep me interested.Break Your Knees - 5/5 - This song is also slow but the lyrics are awesome. They are something everyone can relate to; going through something bad. The song gives hope that we will get through it and be the better for it. The verses sound anxious; the chorus is beautiful. In the middle of the song Lacey shows off her upper range in her head voice, and of course it sounds wonderful and fits with the song perfectly.Enemy - 2.5/5 - This song is very slow. The lyrics are very sad; she apologizing to someone that she loves who she has wronged.Have We Lost - 5/5 - I love the lyrics in this song, specifically the second verse. It is about losing innocence and wanting it back again. It is a sad and fairly slow song, but very pretty. I know I have felt this way before which makes me like it even better.Who Am I - 3/5 - This song is very humbling, it is probably the band thanking God for all their success (\"who am I that you have brought me this far?\"). It is another slow song but I like it.Stay - 4/5 - This is a U2 cover and Flyleaf pulls it off very well. It is slow and acoustic. It is about a girl who is pretty much a mess, and the singer (or God?) wants to stay with the person to make it better. It is a pretty song.\n", "val": 0.027723219245672226}
{"text": "Let me start off by saying that I will give my personal opinion about this album and the band and that no one has to agree. To add to that, I really like Flyleaf. I liked them when they first started getting popular, which was back in 2005 I believe. Since listening to their first album and loving their songs, I was eager for them to come out with a second. The songs in their first album are just the right dose of everything, religion mixed with doubt, struggles, being angry, and upset. I was a Christian then so some of their songs that mentioned God I could relate to. Well, even after becoming Agnostic and Atheist I still liked their songs. Even if some of them were about God or something spiritual it wasn't like it was this \"push in your face\" kind of lyrics. They were simply nice and great lyrics.With Memento Mori, I can't say the same. Yes, if you're Christian or even remotely religious, no doubt you will like this new album. But for the fans that were there at the beginning with the band, and for the ones that aren't necessarily into the whole religious thing, will easiliy shake their heads at the CD. I did listen to every song, and out of all of them I only like two: Again and Tiny Heart. Tiny Heart was actually a song I have listened to for a year or more because Flyleaf had it released out on some websites. I can say that I like their old version better because they changed the lyrics to it for the new album. Still, it sounds nice. The rest of the songs..can't say I care for them too much.This album seemed to take a transition from their last. They seemed to go from \"and every choice you make will affect you, search your own self\" to \"See them surrender, spread out your open hands and he will raise you up,spread out your open hands admit you've held them shut,be swept away by this\". Having said this, the transition affects a lot of their fans that don't see it in that way. Compared to the first line on their first album, this second line seems more pushy and \"in your face\".Within listening to half the CD, I kind of felt like I was being preached to. Instead of really hearing lyrics, some of the songs sounded like a preachy sermon. The songs were repetitive. When you talk about one thing, such as God and the Christianity surrounding it, there is no room for anything else. The song Missing was a bit different but it still followed the same aspect. After hearing the other songs talk about God or Christ it isn't hard to figure that Missing is talking about needing Christ. Actually, all of them seem to be about that.-Beautiful Bride - Anyone who follows or who has followed Christianity should know that \"bride\" = body of Christ. It talks about it in the bible. So when the lyrics talk about this and \"one flesh abiding\", that is more than enough to know how this album will be, after listening to the first song.-Again - This was the band's single and was playing on the radio before the album's release. It's catchy and nice and I do like it. I think it's more of the vocals and music that appealed to me than the lyrics. With Flyleaf, unless you just listen to the lyrics all the time or read them while listening, it's hard to really understand. You know how you'll like a song but not really get the meaning until after reading the lyrics? Yeah. But, it's still a good song, great lyrics.-Chasm - I didn't really like this one. It reminded me of something I used to hear at church on sunday morning. \"So thirsty\" = being thirsty for God. I can't relate.-The Kind - kind of pissed me off when I listened to it and read the lyrics. What I got from this song was basically.. \"you keep sinning and cutting off God from your life and everything you do wrong sets you apart more and more\". And then, somewhere in the middle of the song I hear \"Okay well you've got it wrong cause' you can't serve God and money. You can serve one or the other\", which is basically the rinse and repeat of typical Christians. When Lacey said that it just sort of ticked me off a bit. First off, this isn't the only song that there is dialogue in - I personally hate when people talk in songs and I know a lot of others do too. Second, she's talking about you can't serve God and money, but like one reviewer was saying earlier, the band obviously released two different CD's. They also released another version of their first CD last year, with 5 acoustic songs and a couple of music videos. They're always dressed in something new and they constantly tour. Lacey seems to have her hair dyed or cut in a different way almost every few months or so. And yet you're telling me and everyone else I can't serve God and money? I'm not saying they're hypocrites, but when it comes to a mainstream band that basically seems to have it all, like other money guzzlers in the music industry, it's hard to see any kind of meaning behind that line in a song. Lacey has clothes that don't look inexpensive and let's not forget the tattoos she has. I'm not saying that Christians aren't allowed to do stuff like that with their money but it just sounds hypocritical. I mean, let's face it, Lacey and the band makes more money than I or probably any reviewer on here does and she is able to get a lot of nice clothes and tattoos, something I long to do but can't because of not having enough money.-In the Dark - I like the beginning of this song but then she turns it yet again into something about Jesus. I do like the lyrics though, and the screaming in the background.-Set Apart This World - What I got from this song was that it was about heaven. I didn't really like it, not that it was about that, but I just didn't like it. Just wasn't anything special.-Swept Away - I really didn't like this song. The beginning was really weird. She sounded like a rabid dog. It sort of made me laugh. And yet again it was like another Christian propaganda.-Tiny Heart - I liked the earlier version of this song before it was revised and put on the album. And the beginning sounds great but when she starts the chorus it sounds dumb because she changed the lyrics. Too repetitive, got spoiled on the older version. It was better. But the music sounds good.-Treasure - Hated this one too, mostly because of the beginning. I absolutely hate dialogue in songs, so the beginning made me laugh. Nice tune but couldn't relate.I know what I must sound like. The typical Atheist who doesn't like Christian music. Well, I don't like Christian music, mostly because I can't relate. But that doesn't mean that the lyrics or music isn't good. Flyleaf went from mainstream heavy metal to a sort of full Christian popish sound. So yeah, it is a bit disappointing to the fans that aren't into the whole Christian scene. Like one reviewer on here said, it was like they wanted to get into the mainstream music and then release their true colors after they had everyone hooked. A bit deceiving if you see it in that way. If you're a Christian then you will most likely like this CD and I think that's great. But just from my own standpoint, I was disappointed. It just all sounded like Christian propaganda to me, and it's going to sound different to me because I'm not Christian.So just know, before anyone leaves any kind of comments (because I'm sure some will), just know that I am in no way knocking Christians or their beliefs or Flyleaf. I have an opinion too and this was it.\n", "val": 0.003989205230027437}
{"text": "I picked up Flyleaf's first album few years back, I liked it. All this talk of them being a christian band, I felt you could get that if you really stretched it. Memento Mori. Well, I read up a lot about them. Read a post on their myspace site. Where a member talks about their music being christian influenced, and was okay with that. Now, I have to say they are definitely a christian band.There's the analogy in the myspace post, about a plumber being a christian, does that make him a christian plumber? No, but if he invokes jesus and preaches while he works, and believes jesus has made him a good plumber, then yes it does.I think it kinda sucks, they had some pretty good songs on here. Catching, little more popping than before. I'm all for bands to grow and experiment with their sound. Yet, I don't like music that seems to have an agenda. Whether it's politics or religion.  Their first album there's an influence there sure, but open to a wide range of listeners. This second one is just too preachy for my taste. I could barely get through the whole thing. I like the first 5 songs, vocals and sound, music is good, but the whole religion thing is thrown in your face(body of christ, get on your knees, etc.) I just felt like the band did what a few bands before them have done. Gain a mainstream audience and then put out the music they really want to.There's just some deception to this band, they aren't really being truthful about who they really are, just to gain a larger audience. They just seem to walk around the idea or whether they are or aren't a christian band. They don't want to come off too religious to gain and keep the secular fan base, while also not coming off too secular to keep and gain a christian fan base.  Which has some irony to it, since in the song \"The Kind\" the singer, actually speaks, you can only worship god or money, not both.  Meanwhile, they have like 5 different versions of this album selling from retailers. I'm waiting for the song that stops, and  she asks listeners to raise their hands up to jesus and pray for forgiveness.For anyone who thought Creed was going all preachy and religious, they have nothing on Flyleaf.Overall, the album, has some decent sound, and the vocals are good. But I hate only being able to hear an album and not really listen to it. Without being told my life is empty and I'm nothing without jesus in it.\n", "val": 0.00013837438018526882}

I'd imagine other people disappointed with Paramore will love this.Not every song on here is a winner but that's to be expected.  The only real complaint I have is that this album is so much more overtly Christiany than the last.

{"text": "A few years back, the single \"I'm So Sick\" introduced a wide audience to Lacey's passionate voice and Flyleaf's maturing sound as a hard rock quintet with the ability to connect with the heart. I was hooked from that first wrenching scream, and have since seen them perform on a number of occasions--each bigger than the last, as their fanbase grew.The ceaseless touring and giving to their fans meant that we had to wait for a second album, and I was quick to pick this one up. The first listen-thru left me ambivalent, but hopeful. I liked a lot of the lyrics and sounds, yet it seemed at arm's length in some way. Further listens have erased any doubts and convinced me this is a deeper, more mature album, one I'll enjoy listening to for months to come. Without losing their sound, Flyleaf has stepped it up a notch, and the results sparkle on songs such as \"This Close,\" \"Chasm,\" and \"Again.\"I often like harder bands, such as Underoath and Chevelle, but Flyleaf gives us a blend of honesty, pain, and hope that is hard to surpass. A lot of that centers around Lacey's voice and vulnerability, but the band captures the same feelings in the music. They reward our patience with a full set of 14 songs, none of them a throwaway.Although I wished for a few more of those screams that first nabbed my attention, \"Memento Mori\" lives up to its name, reminding us that we will all die and that we have so much to live for on our way to that final day.\n", "val": 0.033025532960891724}

Why did Verve take nearly half a century to put out this treasure?It's a case of more profitable material, a wealth of studio recordings, crowding out excellent performances that could have been hits. Alas, producer Norman Granz blundered by issuing only a single poorly-selected and poorly-mastered album that flopped commercially.The tapes sank into the vaults and stayed there until jazz researcher Phil Schaap dug into the archives in 1988. He found more than a dozen hours of California recordings along with unheard live sets recorded in Rome and Chicago in 1958. At that point, Verve released a single CD, \"Ella in Rome,\" which was a huge success, but then the label got busy with rereleases of her songbook series.Finally, this year, Richard Seidel, the producer of this boxed set, listened to the tapes and decided to assemble four CDs containing 76 songs both swinging and sentimental. Ella is a joy throughout: creative and playful in her phrasing and scatting, by turns relaxed and spirited in her mood. She even succeeds at the blues, a form she was not particularly known for.What are you waiting for?

Here Ella provides four CDs out of the vaults from which was drawn her Ella in Hollywood album.  I think I have just about every album she ever made but this may be her best.  Not only was she in top form, demonstrating a degree of musicality that so-called singers today can only dream about.  Whether turning a mellow lyric or going off on a improvisational flight, she is always in firm conrtrol.

With backing like that, there was lots of give and take with the musicians and it pushed Ella out further.  Here the backing is relatively subdued, they get the job done in a throughly professional manner, but they do not push the lady and so the renditions of these songs are solid and to the point.  Perhaps it was the small club setting as well.  Ella swings, how could she not, but not the way she did on some of the live concert performances.

By 1980 the party was over, and I'm not quite sure why the economics had suddenly changed so dramatically from the previous two decades.  But the music--and entertainment--has never been the same.  All the more reason to take advantage of this opportunity to return to a time that was.One of the most-played albums in my collection is \"Sarah Vaughan at Mr. Kelly's,\" which now is likely to get some competition from this new Ella set.  Even though Ella is slightly more relaxed and informal than the live recordings done in epic-scale venues--the Opera House, the Rome and Berlin (Mack the Knife) concerts, the Hollywood Bowl and Los Angeles Civic Auditorium recordings--the energy level might be described as \"without governors.\"  She's swinging harder than ever yet, as usual, is able to bring it down instantly for those mellow, intimate ballads.  As for some of the carping about this collection, it's hard to be sympathetic with the complainers after hearing the quality of the music.  The audio is good enough to put me in the actual audience's space, right down in front, where Ella's voice, the distinct notes of the walking bass, the zing of the cymbals and chic of the hi-hat are equally clear.  True, it's not quite the equal of a \"more perfect\" studio recording, which would probably tone down the rhythm section and throw away the moments when the mic momentarily distorts or picks up a few unwanted sibilants.  But that's live music, folks, and for my money, the music, not to mention the listener's experience, is all the better for it.My other Ella albums feature celebrated accompanists like Jimmy Jones or monster jazz pianists like Tommy Flanagan and Paul Smith.  This one has Lou Levy, who also frequently worked with Peggy Lee and is certainly one of the West Coast's all-time best.  There are a few pauses, acknowledgements of celebrities in the audience, moments of indecision about a lyric or the next song--all of which humanize arguably the singer who could live up to the description bestowed upon her by Mel Torme as the \"the greatest who ever lived.\"  I'll refrain from the hyperbole but go so far as to pick one of the numbers--\"It Had to Be You\"--as the best interpretation available on record.In sum, this one may not be quite up to the \"Sinatra-Vegas\" box, which includes a DVD with the 4 CD's covering two decades of live performance (few people realize that Sinatra released only two live albums during his lifetime), but it's close to being as indispensable.\n", "val": 0.0061643002554774284}

{"text": "I had to return this set. The sound quality is early 1980's digital. Very tinny no body or weight to the mix. If you listen to a well recorded album such as Ella at Duke place you will see. As an audiophile and avid listener I finsd even though the performance is good the sound is awful. IMHO not worth the price of admission. The box set as other have noted is awful. It eventually will fall apart. A major historical event such as this deserved so much more. Ella Fitzgerald is one of the greatest jazz singers of all time and Verve really did her an injustice. If Norman granz were alive this shoddy production would never have happened. Shame on you Verve and its a wonder why CD sales are dow. With productions like this at premium prices we consumers deserve so much more.\n", "val": 2.809836223605089e-05}

Many of today's jazz singers like Stacy Kent and Kurt Elling who perform with small groups let their musicians play.  Still...a great collection.\n", "val": 0.029671985656023026}

Most of the time I use the internet, I am looking--praying--for any news on the next Ella Fitzgerald release.  Not only was I over the moon when I head of Twelve Nights in Hollywood, I am beyond ecstatic now that I have finally gotten my hands on it (downloaded it)!!  I am beyond LOVING it!  The sound quality is excellent.  The previous reviewers were so right, there is a real intimate quality to this box set.  I feel as if I was right there in the club, seated in an excellent seat, enjoying the show, wonderful remastering job on the recordings.And then there's Ella.  She simply knocks 'em dead.  She even slay me, all these decades after these recordings were made.  Her voice is at its peek.  She's groovin' and her band is groovin' right along with her.  The song lineup will not surprise any of her loyal fans, but Ella is a real singer, so no matter how many times she sings Mack the Knife, (Give Me) The Simple Life, or Lorelie, the songs are always fresh and swinging.  Naturally, she does mess up.  Frankly, I was looking forward to the mistakes, for Ella's mistakes are when music, spirit join into one big swinging party.  Listen to her stumbling through the lyrics of the song Candy, which was made popular by Big Maybelle, and that Ella magic is sprinkled all over that song the same way Ella does with Mack the Knife.  Then there's the Ella chatter, that's what gives this box set its special charm.  Wisely, the producer did not cut it, as with some of her other concert CDs.  I LOVED IT!All I can say is that if there was a way to rate this box seet more than 5 stars I would.  I do know that I have played this set, all 4 CDs, and listen to it in one sitting!

{"text": "While I don't necessarily disagree with \"irishrose,\" I do like this song, much more so than I thought I would.  I'm not a big Tori Amos fan.  In fact, she used to bug me big time back-in-the-day, for whatever reason.  But maybe my tastes have changed.  I've always admired her strength and versatility.  And while she didn't used to be my thing, I've always been able to recognize her skills and talents as a singer, songwriter, and pianist.  I also got to meet her once, super sweet lady.  \"Snow Angel\" is a lovely song, expertly delivered.  It's dynamic, original, and different from other holiday songs.  As for it being depressing, most Christmas songs are kinda depressing.  There can be immense beauty and hope in sadness.  And sadness, especially in this day and age, and at this time of year, is something we can all relate to and share on some level.  \"I'll Be Home for Christmas (If Only in My Dreams),\" \"Blue Christmas,\" \"Auld Lang Syne,\" the list goes on and on and on.

{"text": "The language of my worldIndependent2005The language of my world is the first studio release of Seattle based rapper Ben Haggerty or more well known as Macklemore after his first release 4 years before Open your eyes EP. In this album Maklemore also sings in collaboration with Paul Rivers Bailey, Evan Roman and Abyssinian Creole.I just discovered this album a few months ago after hearing repeatedly his new debut with Ryan Lewis The Heist. From the 20 songs of The language of my world, all of them where quite entertaining, really intelligent lyrics, speaking from ego, racism, system failure, social injustice, criticism to America and its politics with a really explicit song called the Bush song; its name says it all.It was really refreshing hearing this album and finding out that the old stuff is much more exiting than the new giving an air of hope for social change. It really makes you understand why it was so unknown back in 2005, no politic interests from mainstream networks.In the beats aspect you can hear that they have a rich melodic and harmonic work, seaming to have a big 2Pac influence which in my taste make them better than this kind of new commercial hip hop beats that some (not all) of his new tracks have. The mix is well done and all the instruments and voices have their rightful place; the mastering has a good dynamic range; it gives this old-school rap kind of feeling.But not all of it is good, even dough it has big 2Pac influences, as well as some 50 cent ones. You can hear that some of the tracks give you more a copy feeling rather than an influence one. However it was maybe made with this intention, but in decisions like this its better to act careful since some listeners will not be happy and won't try to understand thinking of it definitely like an imitation.\n", "val": 0.004437128081917763}

{"text": "If this album served as my only Macklemore experience, I wouldn't be reviewing it. I wouldn't spend the time. Mackelmore's growth, however, demands comment and this album serves as a musical stepping stone. In my ears, the truth of this album is that it's disjointed. There are tons of great aspects to it and many of the songs would be exceptional save for the contradictions of light and dark.  Take the intro. It starts with a dark, pulsating, coliseum beat which is quickly supported by electronic horns working hard to continue that dark \"war like\" march forward. But then the dark stops. The loop ends with this light high pitched flourish that seems out of place and contradictory to the established tone. As a listener, I am pulled in to the expansive aggressiveness and snapped out of it by the light flourishes. I would say, more than anything else, that disjointed use of light and dark collapses this album. Not that it needs to. In fact, I would argue that the balance of light and dark (or serious) is what makes the Heist and The Unplanned Mixtape so exceptional, but this album represents an effort in that direction, not a success.With that said, there are plenty of songs to enjoy in this album. If you like the silly deepness of Macklemore's ... And We Danced,  American, or Thriftshop, you'll find it here in the form of \"Penis Song\" and \"Bush Song.\" In fact, these attempts at the song type are largely on par with his later works because they are consistent throughout the presentation in terms of lyrics, beats, and instrumentation.\"White Privilege\" contains all the right elements of a lyrically sharp song in which Macklemore essays on the theft of hip hop by the white, privileged class and his own role in that effort. While the lyrics and vocal qualities of this song nearly parallel those of The Heist, the sampling and DJ work bore. The music choice is simplistic and overly repetitive throughout and again the problem of high lightness and \"serious\" content contrast one another sharply. This same contrast of high lyric / vocal quality and poor musical beats exists on the songs \"B-Boy,\" \"Claiming the City,\" and \"City Don't Sleep.\"In retrospect, knowing where Macklemore went helps me appreciate this album. Clearly the talent is present vocally and Macklemore must have received this feedback because when he returned, he had the issue solved. A lot of this credit, I assume, is owed to Ryan Lewis. When Ryan Lewis started working with Macklemore, parity existed: strong music, strong lyrics and strong vocals. You gotta give it to Ryan Lewis and Macklemore, they identified the apparent strengths and weaknesses and bolstered the work as a whole. I'd really like to see the two do a revision / re-release of this album now that they've got each other, now that they have the cocktail just right.\n", "val": 0.0002019656531047076}

I don't mean that in a pretentious way. I mean to say that I can listen to each track on its own and feel something different. They are all quality. Some are hilarious, some are political, some talk about the art form of hip hop. Each one brings something a little different. Macklemore is a poet, no doubt about it. Not to mention the beats are phenomenal. It makes you want to turn up your speakers, close your eyes, and just let it absorb you. He incorporates some funk, a little bit of soul, a little bit of rock. Everything is unique. The tracks aren't weighted down with distorted or overwhelming beats, it's just PURE.Buy it, you won't regret it. And if you get a chance to see him live, do it.

{"text": "This is a love it or hate it album. You'll either be completely annoyed by Kid Sister's overthetype style or you'll be charmed, recieving it as something cute, fun & sassy. Surprisingly I absolutely love this album. I haven't been a fan of the modern hipHop sound for some time. I prefer old Skool' Rap/Hip-Hop from the 80's and early 90's, Which is most likely why I adore Kid Sister's album so much. It's such a throwback. This album is fun, and it shouldn't be taken seriously.A clash of hiphop, crunk and rap intertwined with electronic/trance and 80's/Pop undertones. It all comes together as pure HOT POP music. The production is excellent, It sounds like quality work and not the trash I was expecting.The songs are all melodic and colorful. The \"Rap Verses\" are just Kid Sister cuttin' up and havin' a LARGE time. Even though I DO NOT have a clue to what she's rapping about at times, The beats and hooks are crazy fresh and catchy. It's party music, The energy is remeniscent of 80's pop/dance that was referred to on the radio as the AQUANETTE-SET, Freestyle songs like \"Diamond Girl\" or stuff by Expose', Covergirl, Neneh Cherry (Buffalo stance) with some Salt'n'Pepa (Push it) and JJ fad (Supersonic) in the mix. All that funk jampacked in this itty bitty disc.Picture Kid Sister flowin' to an instrumental like \"Fresh\" by Kool And The Gang. If you like that thought, You'll have a blast this album.Favorites right off the back are \"Right Hand Hi\" \"Life On TV\" \"Daydreaming\" \"Switch Board\" \"5-4-3-2-1\" \"Get Fresh\" \"You Ain't Really Down\" & Of course \"Pro Nails\". (8) Favorites out of (12) calls for a (5) star rating. I'm just so shocked at how much I like this album. I never wouldv'e thought.\n", "val": 0.018148010596632957}

She is good, on a super INDIE label called Fool's Gold. She is similar in flare to M.I.A. and much better than Lady Gaga. If you like old school hip hop like Salt N Pepa or Missy Elliot or Da Brat then check her out. I recommend checking out her website and listening to either LIFE ON TV or GET FRESH.

Something about LIFE ON TV reminded me of Saturday morning watching That's So Raven with the kids.

It brings back memories of how hip-hop used to be, how it is, currently; how wonderful to hear a female MC.  But then, ULTRAVIOLET isn't just hip-hop.

The material is beautifully written and arranged with a deep-rooted respect for those artists who laid the groundwork before her. Every track is memorable and addictive.

In addition to these outstanding ballads are the hard-driving numbers like \"There Ain't No Cure,\" and \"Bring It With You When You Come,\" demonstrating that she can belt out rock songs just as well.

{"text": "This is certainly a clich by now but if there were any justice in the music business, this recording and Christine's poignant tribute to her producer and mate Doc Cavalier, \"The Gone of You\" both deserve Grammy recognition.  Let justice prevail this time.  Yes, this record is simply stunning on many levels.  The long -time featured vocalist with the Saturday Live Band has released her first album of new songs in six years.  This could have easily been a downer, having endured the tragic losses of two people who were very close to her.  Instead, you get powerful statements about love and the affirmation of life.  As Christine remarked to me in our radio interview, \"I just decided to jump back into life with both feet and make the most of it\".She invites many guests aboard, often repaying the favor of having her sing on their records.  These include Marshall Crenshaw, Dion DiMucci, and Ian Hunter as duet partners and G.E. Smith, Big Al Anderson, (NRBQ), Eric \"Roscoe\" Ambel (The Del-Lords), Catherine Russell, Levon Helm, and more as accompanists. Obviously she has tons of respect among her fellow artists but it's her knack for soul and R&B that shine most brightly here. Her voice is just so damn commanding, soulful, and sexy that it becomes the focal point of everything she takes on.  There are eleven originals that run the gamut from hard-charging rock and R&B (\"Love Make You Do Stupid Things\", \"Bring It With You When You Come\" and \"Cradle Did Rock\" among others) to ballads such as the title track and \"Like Honey\".  Of course, the central theme is \"The Gone of You\" which appears twice, in full band and in demo versions.  Few songs of loss are stated more directly, and honestly.The aforementioned alone would make a great record but Ohlman's carefully chosen obscure covers from the deepest reaches of her extensive record collection add tasty finishing touches. She duets with Dion on the southern soul tune \"Cry Baby Cry\", and with Crenshaw on the Motown hit, \"What's the Matter With You Baby\". She nods to the loss of Rebel Montez's founder, Eric Fletcher, on Link Wray's \"Walking Down the Street Called Love\" which is taken from a live radio performance with Fletcher on guitar.  \"The Deep End\" is a treasure; easily one of this year's best records.

{"text": "Rock `n' roll women have always been a sparser commodity than their male counterparts. Even the adjective that describes a forceful rock `n' roll performance discriminates with its anatomical reference. Rock's had a few chart-topping female stars, including Wanda Jackson, Janis Joplin, Ann Wilson, Joan Jett and Pat Benatar, but the bulk of female rockers labor in day jobs that overshadow their solo output, or work in local obscurity. Patty Scialfa's better known for her marriage and membership in the E Street Band than for her three releases, Karla DeVito is remembered more for the video she made with Meat Loaf (on which she lip-synched Ellen Foley's vocal) than her solo album or subsequent song writing, and Ronnie Spector took decades to emerge from the shadow of her former husband and producer.Christine Ohlman, whose twenty-year gig with the Saturday Night Live Band has put her voice in the ears of millions of listeners, has released six albums and contributed vocals to dozens of projects, yet remains more of a cult favorite than a name star. She sings in a gutsy rock `n' roll voice edged in soul and blues, part Bonnie Raitt and part Genya Raven, with an element of Van Morrison's early wildness. Her throwback sound combines the romanticism of Brill Building pop and horn-fed Stax muscle (courtesy of the Asbury Jukes' Chris Anderson and Neal Pawley) into a potent rock `n' roll stew. Her music reaches back to a time when guitars were front and center and bass lines propelled dancers to the floor.The album opens with Ohlman growling her lovesickness against a twangy variation of the riff from Barrett Strong's \"Money.\" She's drawn to the wrong man, but loyal to a fault, recounting the reasons to break away but lamenting what she's missing, proclaiming everlasting love and, in the tradition of the Crystals, opening her arms without worry of what others will think. She slings it out with the ease and familiarity of a club singer, working the crowd and drawing listeners close. Ohlman's band is similarly road-tested (Michael Colbath's bass playing is particularly notable), and her guests include Ian Hunter, Al Anderson, Eric Ambel, Levon Helm, Dion, and Marshall Crenshaw. Her dozen originals are complemented by covers of Van & Titus' deep soul \"Cry Baby Cry,\" Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells' \"What the Matter With You Baby,\" and Link Wray's \"Walkin' Down the Street Called Love.\"Once upon a time, when rock `n' roll thrived on the radio, this album would have spun off several hit singles. But in today's fragmented music market, and with little room for raw, gutsy guitar-based music, you'll more likely hear this in the background of a Fox TV show whose music coordinator is tasked with setting a rebellious mood, or perhaps on a celebrity musician's weekly satellite radio program. Of course, you can also hear Ohlman in her weekly gig on SNL, and perhaps the show's producers will be so kind as to offer her a spotlight to sing her original songs - songs that stand tall alongside the covers she curates for the band.

{"text": "\"The Deep End\" is that rare record that not only compelled this listener to listen to it in its entirety in one sitting but also has zero filler; every track, one through fifteen, are gems unto themselves (see separate track by track reviews in the download section.)  Christine wears her influences well, steeped in Delta Blues, baptized in Deep Soul, drenched in rock'n'roll.  Her credentials are amplified by guest vocals from Dion, Mott The Hoople's Ian Hunter and Marshall Crenshaw; Al Anderson (ex-NRBQ) and Levon Helm have cameos on guitar and drums.  \"The Deep End\" is, however, a record that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Christine's songs come straight from the heart; songs about wild lust (\"Bring It With You When You Come\"); songs about obsessive love (\"There Ain't No Cure\"); songs about personal loss that pour down in buckets of pain (\"The Gone Of You\").  The organ intro to  \"Cry Baby Cry\" signals the listener they have entered the Church of  Christine; they just don't sing 'em like they used to as Dion and Christine testify on this Deep Soul rarity.  \"Like Honey\" is an original song that could be mistaken as a cover of Ruby Johnson or Otis Redding as it evokes the spirit of Stax Records and the Memphis Horns. The punch and funk of \"Everybody's Got A Heartache\" (think Sly & The Family Stone and the Isley Brothers) shows that Soul has no color.  The title track is a bitter-sweet testament to the power of enduring love; it has the feel of Springsteen's \"Darkness On the of Town.\"  Christine uniquely combines her influences, writing songs that make her a true original.  \"The Deep End\" hit this listener hard on the first listen and improves with each listening.

I had listened to the clips here - and honestly they don't even remotely do what this album is justice.The whole album is great - and unique (both lyrically and musically).  Usually artists that try to be \"poetic\" - to be \"artsy\" in their lyrics - grate on my nerves because they are too esoteric to really \"meet you where you're at.\"  But in Phil's case the lyrics manage to be both poetic and very meaningful at the same time.  Usually albums that have a \"highly produced\"/\"synth\" sound tend to grate on my nerves because they lack simplicity.  But, while this album does have some of this sound, it works - well I might add.  Musically, I find this a bit of a breath of fresh air compared to the standard fare out there.If I could sum this album up in one sentence: \"This is the cry of one who has seen what sin has done, is looking to Jesus for their present help so they can run their race well & endure, and is longing to be home with their Love - their Savior.\"  And it follows that progression in track order...this is one of those CD's you really do need to listen to with the tracks in the order given to really \"get it\".I started to list out my \"favorite\" songs from this album, but I erased it because I realized that I pretty much like them all - they've all been a blessing to me.  \"Safe\" is still my top favorite, followed by \"Hold On\" probably - but after that it's mostly a toss-up because the rest are so great.This album will encourage your heart & draw you deeper in your love relationship with Jesus.

It is that good.I especially love the song, \"Eden.\"  I had never heard a song sung from Adam's perspective before concerning what was lost.....but there is hope in terms of what we will have again.  I just love the imagery in the song.  Would make an awesome music video.One of the coolest songs on the CD is \"Hold On.\"  Just has a great groove and an infectious chorus.But there are a few songs you could do in a church setting as well.  We've been doing \"In Your City\" which is a great anthem that looks at the coming future glory with Christ.\"Safe\" is the only song that is, well, safe, and made for radio.  It is a decent song, but it is the least original.  Still, hopefully because of its easy appeal it will open up listeners to buying the CD and experiencing the awesomeness of the rest of the project.\n", "val": 0.032314058393239975}

Sir Laurence Olivier had a thing for 20's and 30's popular music in the film which fit in nicely and I found very enjoyable. Upon being connected to the internet at home back in '06 or '07 I began the off and on hunt. After finding nothing directly from the movie, I looked into music from the era. Finally the other day I purchased this cd along with a few other cd's from the era. This one left the others far behind in regards to my search for related music from the movie. So if you are like me and looking for good music from that time period that sounds very similar to the music used in the film, (though I don't know if any of the tracks on this disc were actually used), I would say that this would be an excellent starting point. Enjoy.\n", "val": 0.012451812624931335}

The twenties and thirties were times that were both interesting historically and also very hard for most people.  Following WWI and also the depression, there was much to be both mournful about as well as not too happy.  People were desperate for music that spoke to better times and would help remove some of the gloom.  The thirties preceded WWII and most didn't want to even think of that, and so this music represents more than merely vintage and antiquated music, but rather history in music score.\n", "val": 0.018669139593839645}

Of course this was the dawn of electric recording, and you can almost FEEL the excitement this newfound clarity must have inspired in many of these players. Most of the arrangements are wonderful: the sharing & interplay between the musicians is often joyous. What an experience it must have been to hear these bands live, I have a feeling they were quite loud & exciting to behold. And the tempos! Most range from jaunty to breakneck. You'd have to be dead not to leap up and dance to that! I used the track list to check on some of the bands I favored and bought an early Ted Weems CD & others.

Some of those pieces of Classical Music includes the London Choir both of which transport me to wonderful state of mind.Should you have the qualities necessary, these collection is worth acquiring even if you have to set aside some pieces of music that you may not want to hear.Lastly, I must say that I agree with reviewer Ms. Kelly.

Odd - at times Media Player can mess up the data of music - advice: 'turn off the 'AUTO' features in 'OPTIONS'. Virtual DJ (its free) - provides all the information you will desire in its 'TAG EDITOR' feature - Was delighted to see all my 'questions' answered. And of course the contributions from 'REVIEWERS' here and 'Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia' .\n", "val": 7.017523603281006e-05}

{"text": "The selection of \"war horse\" favorites is excellent. This is the kind of album to put on when you want classical music to listen to without making a decision, which composer, which piece, which album, etc. Unfortunately, the quality of the performances on this album ranges from good to almost unacceptable. The \"Ride of the Valkyries\" reminds me of an impatient person jangling his keys as he waits for the next train to pull up to the station. The \"Blue Danube\" is fine, until the percussion section weighs in, sounding like a high school marching band, only not as good. The Brandenburg #3 is sure in a choppy hurry. Who swallowed a metronome?Some of the other performances are adequate, even good. The 2nd Movement (The \"Elvira Madigan\") of the Mozart Concerto, the Barber Adagio, are fine. This is studio music, and it seems as if some of the more familiar pieces were fobbed off in a hurry to get them onto a recording. I used to sing choral music with the occasional orchestra, and when musicians are on the clock, sometimes you don't rehearse a more familiar piece and just show up to the performance and have at it. Perhaps that's what happened here. Ok, people, you all know Beethoven's Fifth. Let's go.However, it's five dollars, in fact, not even, so it's worth putting up with some of the pieces sounding awful in exchange for a lot of good listening. I may delete the offending works from the playlist.\n", "val": 7.758117862977087e-05}

{"text": "This is an excellent sampler of well-known classical pieces. The London Philharmonic is an outstanding orchestra and the recordings are excellent. My only reason for giving this a 4 star review rather than 5 stars is that some pieces that were not included here certainly should have been. Nothing from \"Night at an Exhibition\"? Barber of Seville is included but not William Tell? I see Jupiter from The Planets but not Mars?It's very subjective, assembling a list of greatest classical pieces, but the list on this album is a bit heavy on Mozart and light on pieces that should have been included. The exclusion of William Tell, with its incredible diversity of famous themes, is cause alone to merit the loss of a star.Still - this is a tremendous bargain and it doesn't commit the ultimate sin of excerpting great pieces to include a few seconds of the recognizable melody. This CD - with a few additions - should be part of the curriculum of every music appreciation class.\n", "val": 0.0005836286582052708}

{"text": "Have you ever bought a CD that claimed to have the best movie songs of all time (or at least something like that), and then you listen to it, and it's a bunch of crap songs from movies no one's ever heard of?  Well this is NOT the case with this CD.  When they say \"The 50 Greatest Pieces of Classical Music,\" they REALLY mean it.I love classical music, but I'm no junky.  I certainly can't name most of them.  I just like to listen to it every now and then.  Having said that, I listened to every one of these songs, and there are only four or five that I don't think I've ever heard before.  All the others are so famous that even someone like me has heard them.This is a great CD to get if you have a pitiful classical music selection, which you would like to expand.  This will give you almost all the basics.  There are songs with just strings, there are powerful marches, there are absolutely beautiful piano songs, and there are plenty of songs with vocal choirs.  There's a little bit of everything here.My favorites (I'll just go by track number):Track #1 - This is the classic Looney Tunes sunrise music. :) Gotta love Looney Tunes.Track #6 - A very calming, beautiful piano piece.Track #10 - This is such a unique, magical song.  Naming it \"The Planets\" was very appropriate.Track #13 - I'm pretty sure this one was in Looney Tunes, too.  What wasn't?Track #15 - This was one I'd never heard before, but I instantly loved it and its beautiful violins.Track #17 - One of my absolute favorite pieces EVER.  Reminds me of The Jungle Book (the live-action one).Track #20 - Another beautiful piano piece.  I believe it was in Man on a Wire, but I heard it before that.Track #26 - I think I remember falling asleep to this on the way to my dad's house.  Good memories.Track #32 - This one never gets old.There is only one song I can think of that needs to be in this collection.  It is way at the top of my favorites list, and it's \"Cello Suite No. 1.\" Seriously, why isn't that on here?  That's OK, though.  This still rocks.  I am very pleased with this purchase, and I recommend it to anyone who loves any kind of music.  Heck, this is the only type of music they had, way back when, so I think everyone should give this a shot.  I'm 27, I listen to almost every type of genre, including rock and hip hop, and I still appreciate my roots.  GET THIS!!\n", "val": 0.0314997136592865}

Many of the songs should remain as such, unable to stand on their own as solid songs.'Good Life' is not one of these songs. From the beginning beat to the whistles, this is a carefree single that glides along so freely it is meant for summer nights relaxing with friends. Ryan Tedder's delivery is so whimsical that it lends to the spirit of the song without for a moment taking away from the emotions being projected. 'Good Life' is one of those pop songs that almost impossible to dislike; it's so simple and yet so infectious that it could be blasted from speakers just as easily as it could be softly played while reading a novel.

If you listen to the youtube version here:[...]And then listen at roughly 2:08 and 3:08, he'll hit a high note and hold it a few. This is my favorite part of the song. I downloaded both the exclusive, and exclusive-deluxe version, and neither of them match the youtube version. It's only $2, but it is frustrating to have to purchase an item prior to realizing they are not selling what is being advertised.

{"text": "One Republic's memorable song \"Secrets\" by this time is no secret but every time I hear it, the extremely powerful lyrics and melody never escapes the mind.  The opening drone of the cello that begins the song sweeps the doors open for the listener to a lyrical rendering of dramatic proportions that lead singer Ryan Tedder meticulously performs along with the rest of the band members.\"Secrets\" possesses a very creative and poetic narration that lends itself to interpretation that only the songwriter is able to completely understand that is dependent on the circumstance.  But for the average listener, the precise instrumentation of the pounding drums and string arrangement as well as Tedder's strong vocals show much intimacy of  the dilemmas that are written within each word of the song.  But what tends to ring out are the lyrics that convey and reveal much about betrayal and misunderstandings and the eventual chanting and giving all the secrets away.Indeed, a song that may be played more than once and may be placed on the list of the most emotionally charged lyrics.\n", "val": 0.017077621072530746}

{"text": "I stumbled upon a video of Ewan playing a song from his second album the other night, and ever since I can't get enough of him. He has a mastery of the guitar that is absolutely phenomenal. Listening to some of his songs, it's hard to believe only one man is playing this music when it could easily be two or more instruments playing. There isn't a single song on this album that doesn't capture your attention and blow you away.\n", "val": 0.006681929808109999}
{"text": "I added \"on this recording\" to the end of my title for a reason: Ewan Dobson has a \"one in a million\" degree of guitar virtuosity, and I hope that he learns to apply his ability to something that more closely resembles \"music\".  Here, in his eagerness to show us his ability, he plays pieces with a machine-gun-like technique that leaves little residue of \"art\" or \"music.\"I heard an athlete tell a story about his experience long-jumping in the Olympics.  As his time was coming up he was becoming more and more nervous, and began fouling - taking off past the line - on his leaps over and over.  Someone suggested to him that rather than try to take off RIGHT at the line that he try jumping from six inches behind the line.  Now with his mind freed of the worry of being called for a foul he took off with a safety margin and jumped a foot farther than he ever had before - easily winning the gold medal.Mr. Dobson would be well-served to apply that lesson to his playing.  He needs to back off from playing RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF FASTEST POSSIBLE SPEED to allow room for expression. Guitar virtuosos are like gun-slingers.  The up and coming shredders often become so enamored with speed that they develop a tunnel vision that doesn't allow them to pay attention to things like dynamics, tone and other things that add up to \"music.\"Several pieces are written by the man himself, but the cumulative effect, while technically advanced, are headachingly repetitive and machinelike.  Take a listen to the samples.  Then compare them to samples from (I'll try to keep it to a short list)  Tommy Emmanuel&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Endless-Road/dp/B00030CH1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Endless Road</a>,  Guy Van Duser&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/American-Finger-Style-Guitar/dp/B0000003MK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">American Finger Style Guitar</a>&nbsp;and Andrew York&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/York-Perfect-Sky/dp/B000003WFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">York: Perfect Sky</a>.Dobson ends the CD with the technically impressive Caprice #5 in A minor written by Paganini for violin.  (Take a listen to Itzhak Perlman playing the same piece&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Paganini-24-Caprices/dp/B00004R95O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Paganini: 24 Caprices</a>.

Dobson gets the notes, but his performance is strewn with alternations between inappropriate pauses (on the more difficult passages) and rushes through other portions that show that his goal was \"play it as fast as I can\" rather than \"play it as musically as I can.\"  I suspect that if he had made his attempt (going back to the long jumping analogy) with room to spare taking off from behind the line that the result would be different.\n", "val": 3.0174594940035604e-05}

{"text": "I love Hayley Westenra's voice. She truly impressed me during her stint with Celtic Woman. After that, I scrambled to listen to her solo recordings. So, when I heard that she was releasing a Christmas album, I was thrilled. It was disappointing. Much of it simply does not sound like Hayley. She has such a strong, clear voice yet on many of the tracks, she sounds weak and airy. Her mature voice impressed me so much on her album \"Odyssey.\" Where is that voice now? \"Veni Veni Emmanual\" and \"Silent Night\" stand out but otherwise, this CD was a disappointment from Westenra.\n", "val": 3.311288674012758e-05}
{"text": "Hayley Westenra has the voice of an angel; her fans have known that, since the beginning. But, what we truly discover with this recording is that she is also a Christmas angel. If at the time of listening to this recording the listener is not yet in the Christmas spirit, this CD will do the trick. It is a diamond that, once owned, will be cherished and I dare anyone to not be reluctant to loan it out to friends and family.Many vocalists the world over put out Christmas CDs that, while perhaps very beautiful, are stale in song choice. Not so here. It is on Hayley's Christmas CD that we hear the rarer, more solemn spectrum of the holidays as in such the spine-tingling, introspective Veni Veni Emmanuel (sung entirely in Latin) and The Coventry Carol. Also, Hayley's voice soars in her rendition of Carol of The Bells and enchants in the Corpus Christi Carol. Not without its playful charm, included are also Sleigh Ride and a stirring The Little Drummer Boy. Hayley also covers the popular song River with much heart and puts her soul into it. And, last but not least, there is a gem called Christmas Morning which the singer wrote herself which has the great infectiousness to bring a smile and the keen yearning for snow, family and everything involving Christmas celebration.If you haven't bought this CD yet, what are you waiting for? Stick it in the stereo, curl up in front of a roaring fire or brightly-lit Christmas tree with a cup of cocoa while the snow falls softly outside and drift off into bliss.\n", "val": 0.011856157332658768}
{"text": "Hayley's new album will surely lift your Christmas spirit like never before. Beautiful vocals, creative arrangements, and incredibly well-written brand new songs are all put together to make this album very special and different from all the other Christmas albums. Hayley presents some popular seasonal songs such as 'Silent Night,' 'Sleigh Ride,' 'Carol of the Bells,' and 'The Little Drummer Boy,' but the wonderful thing is that these songs don't sound like your typical Christmas song on the radio. In addition to these songs, Hayley sings the soft, emotional 'River,' which is sure to send chills down your spine. And her version of the lesser heard song 'The Little Road to Bethlehem' is just so fantastic and cheerful! Hayley also co-wrote three songs, 'Christmas Morning,' 'All with You,' and 'Peace Shall Come'. I've always been a little apprehensive about newly-written Christmas songs, but these songs are easily the very best on the album. My personal favourite is 'Peace Shall Come'--I've never heard a more perfect song. I'm sure you will think so too. ;) So leave alone the traditional, same old singers you hear every winter and buy this beautiful, magical album.\n", "val": 0.04585781693458557}

All With You is my 2nd most preferred song on this album since it's an upbeat and beautiful ballad. Peace Shall Come is also enjoyable but feels more like a Disney song than a Christmas song.

Christmas is a time of displaying gentle love to all humanity and true to her artistic form she has captured the essence of the season. Christmas is about \"a light that has shown through the darkness.\" Winter Magic does this in a beautiful way. Hayley does not simply sing the songs, she caresses them with love. She pours herself into every song to bring us hope, which is summed up in her original \"Peace Shall Come\".In our Northern Hemisphere these are the darkest and longest nights of our year. We are blessed that this young woman of the Southern Hemisphere, who for the first 15 years of her life only experienced Christmas in the summer, has granted to us this essence of light from her homeland. She has brought to our northern nights a glimpse of the Southern Cross. Her choice of songs and musical arrangements has brought to our hearts a wish of peace, love and hope.Additional note: Kudos to the songwriting team of Hayley Westenra and Jeff Franzel - Three wonderful songs!J.F.

{"text": "When artists release Christmas albums, they often have a tendency to make them sentimental and gooey for the season, which completely ruins it. Hayley's newest album does not fall into that category thankfully. I admit, I was not impressed by the original samples until I listened to the entire album on[...]. After that, I was hooked and have been ever since.Hayley is a wonderful singer who puts life and emotion into everything she things, and it definitely shows on this album. She doesn't reach many high notes or have power like on previous albums, which I've noticed some fans don't like, but her voice is still lovely. The only exception is \"Carol of the Bells,\" which feels lifeless, a rarity for Hayley, and \"The Christmas Song,\" which is lovely yet sounds like she had a cold while singing it.The entire album has the Christmas- winter feeling without being sentimental, and I enjoyed seeing more of Hayley's songwriting skills in \"Christmas Morning\", \"All with You\", and \"Peace Shall Come\". The album is varied with a nice selection of sounds ranging from the gentle \"Silent Night\" to the lively \"Sleigh Ride\" to the Anuna-esque \"Coventry Carol\" and the haunting \"Corpus Christi\".In my opinion, this is the best Christmas album I've ever heard.\n", "val": 0.02416061982512474}

{"text": "Winter Magic truly is a \"magical\" album, with a wonderful mixture of seasonal songs. When I first saw the track listing, I was a little disappointed at the lack of familiar carols that I had been hoping to hear Hayley sing. However, I am anything but disappointed with this album. If you love Hayley Westenra, you will love this album, too.With Winter Magic, Hayley didn't just record a collection of all the usual Christmas carols, as most artists do. She has said that she's been planning this album for some time, and that she wanted it to be one that could be enjoyed all season, not just at Christmas time. It is very original, the work of a true artist. She put a lot of thought into the songs, and even wrote 3 of them herself. The musical arrangements are excellent, not to mention her gorgeous vocals. The whole album has a magical, wintry atmosphere.Her voice sounds just the way it should for every song. When the songs are light and cheery, so is her voice. The choral pieces contain strong, pure vocals. Her voice is NOT weak. As she's grown older, her voice has grown too. With every album, her voice sounds a tiny bit different, but always contains outstanding beauty and purity.The Little Road to Bethlehem is one I didn't know. It's a very pleasant, happy song.The whole arrangement of Carol of the Bells is excellent. She starts off softly, but gets stronger as the song builds in excitement. I especially love the way she harmonizes with herself in certain parts.I've never been crazy about The Christmas Song, but Hayley sings it beautifully, and makes me like it anyway.Veni Veni Emmanuel is absolutely stunning. Her vocals are pure and strong. I love the way she lilts on the word \"Davidica\" in the 3rd verse. Then the intensity of the music following the refrain in this section is so thrilling.Silent Night is very pretty. It is warm and soft, almost like a lullaby, but her voice is still as strong and pure as ever. Her vocals here are far better than the recording on My Gift to You, one of her first New Zealand releases.Christmas Morning, one that Hayley wrote, delightfully conjures up images of the delights of childhood Christmases. Her voice is so pretty, and seems to twinkle with the music.Sleigh Ride is very nice. I think belting out this song would've made it sound overdone. I think it's fine the way she did it.In River, Hayley's wistful emotion convinces you that she is \"selfish and sad\", though in reality she is nothing of the sort.The Little Drummer Boy is simply sung with the lovely vocals typical of Hayley.Corpus Christi Carol is another one unfamiliar to me. It's a Middle English carol telling the story of Christ in a symbolic manner. Hayley's haunting, pure vocals right at the end are the highlight of this song.All With You is another one written by Hayley, and is now one of my all-time favorite Hayley songs. The melody is wonderful, and her voice is gorgeous. It rivals her Summer Rain from Treasure.The haunting Coventry Carol is new to me, but now one of my favorites from the album. It's about Herod's slaying of infants in effort to kill the newborn King. The vocals are stunning and impressive, by both Hayley and the young choir.Winter's Dream is full of winter magic. I love the children's vocals throughout the song.The album ends triumphantly with Peace Shall Come, also written by Hayley. I find it to be a song of joy and hope. It is what Christmas is all about.\n", "val": 0.05179836228489876}
{"text": "I particularly enjoyed listening to Silent Night because I compare it to Hayley's recording of Silent Night in her Pure CD (UK edition).  They're both outstanding, but it shows how Hayley has grown:  she has better control, her voice sounds smoother, she has more confidence while still remaining brilliant.Hayley's Winter Magic captures the peaceful, joyful and spiritual message of the Christmas season.

Please read what the other reviewers have to say that have actually received theirs.  You, too, can be one of the lucky people to get a digital work of art.

{"text": "For this, the fourth Hayley Westenra album that I've bought but the first I've reviewed, Hayley has chosen to restrain herself somewhat. There is no evidence here of the power that her voice is capable of, but this appears to be a deliberate choice. If she had chosen to, she could have belted out Sleigh ride, as other singers sometimes do, but even this song is taken at mid-tempo. Those who like Hayley for the power in her voice will find nothing here to appeal to them, but the music is no less brilliant because of its mellowness.A characteristic of Hayley Westenra albums is that different versions are released and this album is no exception. The American version contains 14 tracks. The Japanese version contains those 14 tracks plus a non-Christmas bonus track titled On the wings of time. The British version contains the 14 tracks as released on the American edition plus a duet with Ronan Keating on a song that Ronan co-wrote titled It's Christmas time. Ronan released his own Christmas album in 2009, also including the song. I believe the version on that album is the duet with Hayley, but cannot confirm as I haven't heard that album.The set opens with Little road to Bethlehem, a song previously recorded by both Shawn Colvin and Aled Jones, but it deserved to be more frequently recorded. The next song is Carol of the bells, which I think generally works best as a group song with different voices, but Hayley does as good a solo version as I've heard. Elsewhere, the album contains a few standards including The Christmas song, Silent night, Little drummer boy and the aforementioned Sleigh ride, but those looking for a selection of mostly familiar songs are advised to look elsewhere. To the standards, we should now add River, the Joni Mitchell song that now turns up frequently on Christmas albums though this wasn't always the case.The other tracks include Coventry carol, which is quite well known in Britain though I don't see it very often on American albums. Alison Moyet recorded a fine version for the original A very special Christmas, so anybody who has that album will recognize the song. Two other traditional carols featured are Corpus Christi carol (which I don't remember hearing elsewhere, though I probably have) and Veni veni Emmanuel, which is a Latin version of a more familiar song. Hayley co-wrote three songs (Christmas album, All with you, Peace shall come) while Winter's dream may also be an original song.This is a great mellow Christmas album, especially for those who want a song selection that isn't too predictable.\n", "val": 0.0004912087460979819}

It might not be a direct ABBA rip, but hey... it's a wink, and I definitely get the joke.

Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection you can retry the download unlike iTunes :DIn my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:\n", "val": 0.00025698746321722865}

I really wasn't very impressed that she would honestly take the same kind of page that Beyonce' had brought out last year with Video Phone from Beyonce's extended version of I Am Sasha Fierce, where she made a simple song, and turned it into a made-up collaboration with absolutely no chemistry.

{"text": "I grew up 35 west of New York City outside of Somerville, NJ, There are many differences between urban and suburban perspectives, particularly when it comes to the arts. I was lucky to be part of a loving family and grateful for the values I was taught many of which I still live by today, but all of my education of the arts especially my exposure to theater was generated from the excellent programs within the public school system and from my own determination. My grandmother took me to see Angela Landsbury in \"Mame\" when I was eight years old and I remember feeling an excitement at that performance that has become a life long passion, When I was a sophomore in high school I began reading the Arts and Leisure section of the New York Times and since there was no interest of the subject at home two months before my 16th birthday I initiated probably my only rebellious act as a teenager and started sneaking into the city by train just to go to the theater. This first production of \"A Little Night Music\" was the second show that I covertly found my way into and although I was too young to really understand the complexity of the entangled romantic relationships in the show the music and performances swept me away and made me yearn to experience and learn more about this dazzling area of the arts. What truly makes this musical unique is that every song is a waltz which only enhances the theme of romance. I can't say enough about the talent in this original cast and although there is a central couple in the storyline it is really an ensemble piece. Although \"Send in the Clowns\" was the show's breakout song seeing to this day I remember Hermoine Gingold as Madame Armfeldt performing the song \"Liasons\". \"A Weekend in the Country\" is one of the greatest first act finales ever written. This soundtrack is entrancing even if you have never seen the show.\n", "val": 0.010379371233284473}

{"text": "The other reviewer said they \"expected more\" from the film. The reality is the film was made without a single \"filmmaker\" in sight. Hugh Wheeler, Harold Prince and virtually everyone from the stage show was called upon to create the movie but none of the key creators had any experience in the medium. Broadway usually scoffs when Hollywood takes over one of their musicals but, in this case, it could have helped. So, while the film itself was not great.......the score is another story. Jonathan Tunick, Stephen Sondheim's principal orchestrator, was asked to adapt the music for film and he did IMO a noteworthy job. Everything from the Overture to the finale was orchestrated with the same quality that was used in the play (I even like the \"re-written\" Glamorous Life better in the film).As for Elizabeth Taylor, she got a bad rap for her vocals. I can tell you this: one day I was in another room but was listening to the \"Showtunes\" station on television. I came out to see because I couldn't believe they were playing Liz's rendition of \"Send in the Clowns\" from the movie. They weren't. It was Glynis Johns!! Seriously!! This is how very similar the two vocals are. Besides, the character isn't supposed to have a great voice (which neither Glynis or Liz have) and Miss Taylor does an adequate job. But it's the orchestration that's the real winner here. Perhaps that's why Mr. Tunick received the Oscar for it!\n", "val": 7.721513975411654e-05}
{"text": "I saw the film when it was first released, then purchased the vinyl disc when it was released.  Considering the talent of the director on Broadway, I was taken aback when the entire piece was moved from Scandinavian climes to Austrian whipcream covered imitation.  The essence of the story is how many times the night smiles....this time there was hardly a reason to chuckle.  The cast, to a character, was wonderful, even La Diva Taylor who certainly made a brave attempt to fill the roll, though she more than easily filled her costume.  I read somewhere that even her attempts at singing were actually dubbed in from time to time by someone else.  The loss of her leading man may have thrown her off kiler (and key), but I point my finger at Mr. Prince....I know it was economics that forced the location changes, but did that mean the talented director suddenly lost his direction?  Okay, we're really talking about the singing.  Diana Rigg proved that she was perfect for a Sondheim piece and she proved it later when she starred in the stage version in London of FOLLIES.  Yes, yes, they all sang well, but it was a bit of a hodgepodge dressed up as a feast.  There are many recordings of this musical, and for some reason no one has managed to get the soul so beautifully presented to us in the original production.  God bless Sean Philips, Sally Anne Howes, Dame Judi, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Bernadette Peters but it's that erstwhile mermaid, Glynnis who put the heart into those damned clowns.  The soundtrack is fine, there's more of the waltz music and it stands perfectly well on it's on, but I had hoped for MORE.....ah, well, every day a little death......\n", "val": 0.0009080921299755573}

{"text": "This review applies specifically to the mp3 download version of this album.  The music is amazing, I give it 5 stars.  It's the type of music that lets you get swept away in the Spirit.  However, Amazon did a VERY poor job of converting the album to mp3, which is why I rate it only 3 stars overall.  The album is really intended to be one continuous melody, where one track flows perfectly into the next.  But the method Amazon used to create the mp3s causes there to be an abrupt end to each track with about an additional second of silence tacked on.  When burned to a CD and played end to end, it sounds awful.  Instead of a smooth transition from one song to the next, you get a sudden stop, then a couple seconds of silence, followed by an immediate resumption of the next song.  It sounds like flipping a switch off and then back on.  To get around this problem I actually had to use my own audio editing software to create a fade out effect at the end of each track and a fade in effect at the beginning, so the tracks would appear to flow into each other.  A royal pain and very time consuming, but this album was worth the effort.  It is one of the best praise albums I have ever heard where you can allow yourself to just soak in God's love.  I highly recommend the album, but buy the complete CD instead of the mp3s.\n", "val": 0.007694569882005453}

{"text": "I really enjoy hearing Donny Osmond sing; he had a strong command of his repertoire even when he was very, very young and to this day he is a remarkably multitalented entertainer! This CD has quite a few of his best known songs although of course not every last song can make it into a single CD retrospective. However, what we do get is nothing but five star, high quality control music all performed flawlessly by Donny, sometimes with members of his family; and the quality of the sound is excellent.\"One Bad Apple\" features a very young Donny already showing his excellent ability to sing with other family members; it's a fine way to open up the track set. \"Sweet and Innocent\" has a great flavor to it; Donny sounds terrific! \"Go Away Little Girl\" demonstrates how even from an early age Donny had a gift to interpret a ballad with panache; and I really like \"Yo-Yo\" with that beat. We also get the poignant tunes \"Hey Girl;\" \"Puppy Love;\" \"Too Young\" and \"Why.\" All of these just plain sound good; and that's grand.\"The Twelfth of Never\" is another stunner; and Donny does a particularly fine job singing \"Are You Lonesome Tonight\" with those spoken lyrics in addition to the rest of the song. Donny may have thought he had to rush a bit on \"I'm Leaving It (All) Up To You\" which he does with his sister Marie; but when I hear that lyric Donny has impeccable diction. I just don't hear any evidence of him straining to keep up with Marie on that fast lyric of \"I'm Leaving It (All) Up To You.\"\"Morning Side of the Mountain\" can't sound any better; and \"A Little Bit Country-A Little Bit Rock 'N Roll\" is very well done. \"Soldier of Love\" rocks; and there's yet another gem in \"Sacred Emotion\" with its solid arrangement. \"Any Dream Will Do\" gets the royal treatment from Donny; and the CD ends well with two more numbers, \"Crazy Horses\" and \"Breeze on By.\" I'm really impressed and it leaves me wanting more!Donny Osmond fans will want this for their collections; it brings back so many fond memories for me whenever I hear these classic numbers.

{"text": "I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free.See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours.In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:\n", "val": 0.0003829550987575203}

I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.

{"text": "I Dreamed a Dream (Susan Boyle) / B002XSWMU8I must have listened to the YouTube performance of Susan Boyle's stunning \"I Dreamed a Dream\" a hundred times, so I couldn't wait to buy this when it came out on Amazon. I really should have listened to the preview more closely, though, as this version is vastly different to her live performance and, in my personal opinion, the difference is not for the better.Susan Boyle's live performance was full of passion and depth and vibrato, like an opera singer at the height of her career. Yet all that passion and depth has been stripped out for this recorded version; it feels like someone insisted that she low-ball the song into something soft and 'safe' for elevator music and easy listening stations. Maybe that's what is wrong with the industry today - take a winning voice that stunned the world and rework it so that it's as bland and forgettable as everything else out there. *sigh*There's nothing wrong with this version of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" - the vocals and music are very pretty. But in comparison to the performance we heard before... I know for a fact that this MP3 will sit unused on my computer while I reach for the YouTube version every time.~ Ana Mardoll\n", "val": 4.495362736633979e-05}
{"text": "When it has came down to the impact of Susan Boyle, Susan really stunned the world by the way she has shown it is the voice on the inside that is suppose to count. While that was shown very well from when she performed on Britain's Got Talent, it hasn't been that strong on the recording of her title track from her debut album, I Dreamed A Dream. I thought the magic wasn't really as strong as when she made it out to be before. I felt that it was fair, but not anything to fully rave about. Susan has a great voice, but overall she needs to find material all her own on her next album, if she gets to do one. Susan might have dreamed a dream, but has had a mixed reaction overall.Song: C\n", "val": 4.614822319126688e-05}

In fact, the more I sit quietly and listen to and enjoy this CD in its entirety, the more I appreciate how it all flows together so beautifully.  Not to say you have to listen to it while you're meditating or anything like that...when I'm driving with this CD playing and \"I Dreamed a Dream\" comes on, I really blast it...it's so inspiring! Same with \"You'll See\"...Susan has made that her own.  Madonna should be proud that her song is delivered so beautifully.Against the backdrop of Susan's story and her journey, each song takes on a special meaning and I can appreciate her interpretations all the more.  The second to last song \"End of the World\" has actually become one of my favorites!  It grows on you...revival of the original with Susan's own stamp on it.

When \"I Dreamed a Dream\" was in the 2012 film, I checked it out and it was this weak little voice that did not project to the microphone let alone the auditorium. So, I started previewing the others. When I heard Susan Boyle's sample, that voice projected, reverberated, had volume had emotion. So, I bought the whole song.I can not listen to the song without crying. I have a knowledge from the context of the novel what the character's life is like of which she sings. But the tigers come at night, with voices soft as thunder. I had a dream of what what my life would be, not this hell I'm living.Whether or not I understand if this song is a positive or negative emotion expressed, it does what art should do: provoke thought and emotion. And Susan Boyle has the artistry to make this musical thought scribbled on a page into true performance art.I believe that I will listen to more of her work: if I had heard only one Streisand song, think of the body of art I would have missed!\n", "val": 0.00042799333459697664}

{"text": "Clipse, the dynamic duo from Virginia, return for the third time with Til The Casket Drops.  However, unfortunately for them, the third time isn't the charm.Although Clipse created crazy anticipation for Til The Casket Drops with absolutely excellent singles such as I'm Good and it's remix ft. Rick Ross (mysteriously missing from the release) as well as Kinda Like A Big Deal ft. Kanye West, the album ultimately falls flat.  Malice & Pusha T are still as potent as ever behind the mic with many quotables, but it is the production (DJ Khalil, Sean C, Neptunes) that surprisingly fails to keep up with their sharp wit and flows.The album starts out sizzling with 5 straight bangers in Freedom, Popular Demand, Showing Out, I'm Good, and Kinda Like A Big Deal.  However from that point on the album fizzles fast.  There Was A Murder, Never Will It Stop and All Eyes On Me are just simply too wack to listen to.  Counseling is decent at best.  Those 4 songs (on a 13 track album) disrupt the flow of the album and make it feel uneven and thrown together.  To make it worse is that they are all grouped together with only DOORMAN to save the mediocrity of the middle of the album.  The album ends strongly with Footsteps, Life Change, and Champion.Til The Casket Drops is quite an underwhelming cd.  I wouldn't go as far as to call it a disappointment because there are a couple bonafide bangers.  It's a good album just not the album people were expecting especially after Hell Hath No Fury and Lord Willin.  If you're a fan of the Clipse I would still recommend this album as you could find value in some of the weakest songs, however casual fans are advised to take a listen first.  3.5 stars.\n", "val": 0.00017979941912926733}

{"text": "For Virginia Beach rap duo Clipse, what more fitting time to release their third album than when the weather starts to turn white? Brothers Malice and Pusha T have long made their name on critically-acclaimed, popularly-ignored hardcore rap that largely focused on one thing and one thing only: cocaine, and all the business ventures and death threats that go along with it. From their brutal lyrics, relentless flow, and minimalist Neptunes-provided beats, they've always seemed darker than their contemporaries, more real and, most importantly, more believable. But after yet another long layoff and another sub-standard mixtape to whet their fans' appetites, Clipse have found themselves in a weird place: successful, and with nothing to prove.Perhaps then they can be forgiven for making their first so-so record, one that on the surface seems to have all the necessary ingredients for another celebrated release. The brothers Thornton have retained their sharp tongues and smooth but distinctive flows, rapping out lyrics like \"I keep that dirty money / I'm talkin' fast cash / I'm talkin' razor shaving / I'm talkin' duffle bags\" with the same equal amounts of nonchalance and subtle vigor that they use to spit lines like \"hell, even my garage a mnage / like my hoes exotic, same as my cars\" or \"they think it's cute / while they're giving me dome\" so viciously. They're still obsessed with coke, although here they focus more on the money and fame it's brought them than the actual travails of drug dealing. And the Neptunes are still on board, providing low-key beats with the focus on the brothers' storytelling.But while the formula is there, it seems that the cold heart that Hell Hath No Fury thrived on has been replaced with a lax sense of peace, a feeling that they've reached the plateau of the hip-hop/coke world and there's no point in trying to find anything more to climb. Hell Hath No Fury was a drug-rap classic, an album fueled by Pusha T and Malice's grimy, lurid stories, tales told with all the intensity of a grainy, black-and-white crime scene photograph. Til The Casket Drops, meanwhile, seems content to celebrate its' creators' ascendancy with look-at-me hoopla like the embarrassing \"Kinda Like A Big Deal\" and almost masturbatory self-congratulations like on the bland \"I'm Good\" or standard club jams like \"All Eyes On Me\" or \"Counseling.\"These are tracks that call to mind less savory and far less talented rappers with nothing better to write about, songs that concentrate more on all the sluts Clipse can score or how much high-class clothing they're currently sporting than the kind of realistic imagery they've made their name on. Clipse are still obsessed with reminding people that they \"[got] it from the streets,\" but when they follow it up with lines like \"rockin' those Prada goggles / you're my next top model / your style like Jackie yo now just sit back and let `em marvel\" or \"pump that camera mama, rip that runway baby / now pop that collar, see them dollars,\" it comes across as the kind of empty posturing Clipse used to be the antithesis of.The Neptunes don't help things with beats that often come across as recycled or merely undercooked, from the lame synths of \"Champion\" to the faux-funk of \"There Was A Murder,\" but by and large the blame here falls squarely on the Thornton brothers. Til The Casket Drop's hollowness is even more glaring when they actually sound like the Clipse of three years ago. Opener \"Freedom\" spins a tale of redemption from a sweet sample, melodic electric guitar, and sharp string accents behind spirited verses, while a hard-hitting song like \"Showing Out\" calls to mind Hell Hath No Fury's single-minded passion and boasts one of the catchiest choruses on the record. The best tracks, however, are those that return to Clipse's roots, namely the one-two punch of \"Door Man\" and \"Never Will It Stop,\" both of which mix drugs, violence, and money in a volatile cocktail that always seems on the verge of blowing up in one's face.But Clipse can do so much better than much of Til The Casket Drops, and it's disappointing to see such a talented duo seem to go through the motions so often. Clipse's biggest strength was always their realism and combustive flow, and when they spend so much of their talents rambling on about tired rap stereotypes like girls, fast cars, and huge diamonds, it only makes the difference between songs like \"Kinda Like A Big Deal\" and \"Never Will It Stop\" so painfully obvious. It's a deserved victory lap, to be sure, but one hopes that Clipse won't lose sight of what got them here next time around.\n", "val": 0.0005778557388111949}
{"text": "One of the enduring mysteries of music is how commercial success has eluded Clipse, a group that appeals to every demographic from hipsters to gangsters to suburban teen girls. After two (now three) acclaimed albums, four anthem-filled mixtapes and one staggeringly successful clothing line, Clipse are no longer waiting to be legitimized by the RIAA and have unapologetically assumed their roles as the \"best duo ever.\" Alongside this swagger, Til The Casket Drops showcases a new repertoire that goes beyond the crack rap that has pigeonholed Clipse for so long and instead offers a deeper appreciation for life.The confidence exuded on this album is exemplified by Pusha's parting words on the album's opening cut (Freedom), \"I own you all.\" The journey through the rest of the record includes the catchy conceit of  \"Kinda Like a Big Deal\" (\"Lights, camera, action/ The chain itself's a dang distraction/We claim the belt/ The glory I bask in,\")  and the simple satisfaction of \"I'm Good\" (\"I'm lookin' good, and I'm feelin' good/ Try and stop my shine/ I wish a brotha would.\") On \"Doorman\" Clipse rap \"Big charms, hanging from my big chain/ Swinging side to side, feelin' like I'm T-Pain.\"  While on \"Champion\" they offer, \"Overcame the odds/ So we overdo them cars/ We done balled around the world/ Now we reaching for them stars.\"  The lyrical skill that gave them the swagger in the first place is intact and in full effect.Til the Casket Drops is also defined by a maturation in mindset that moves beyond the girls, cash, cars mantra of some of the singles. The deep-album cuts offer poignant, insightful rhymes that reveal a duo who've had their fill of materialism and are seeking something more meaningful. On \"Champion\" we hear \"I thought life was a bad girl, bad car/ Life is with your kids, watchin' Madagascar.\" On \"Life Change,\" Malice rhymes \"Now I see clearly with a family of four/ Never did I deserve a two-seater Porchse,\" and later \"Wasted so much time stuntin' for folks/ When really the whole time I was stuntin' my growth.\" On \"Footsteps,\" Clipse give a warning against emulating their lives \"These footsteps could lead you astray/ Lead you to the cell, or lead you to a grave...Don't let my wrongs give you the right of way.\" The sincerity on these tracks shows that the Clipse are cognizant of their new responsibilities as both hip-hop superstars and role models.On Til the Casket Drops the Brothers Thorton confound critics that relegate them to being a one-trick pony and finally assert their dominance in rap. The album will eventually be seen as a watershed moment for their growth as artists, and hopefully as a turning point for record sales as well.

They would rather pigeon-hole the entire hip-hip community as ignorant, frivolous and violent individuals.

{"text": "In late 2009 The Clipse returned on a new label, Columbia Records, to release \"Til The Casket Drops\". This album comes three years after their previous album \"Hell Hath No Fury\", an album that was the hip hop equivalent to Weezer's \"Pinkerton\"- a sophomore album that was superior to its predecessor, but had less than stellar sales. This time around, they are doing things a little different. For starters, The Neptunes, who produced all of their first two albums do eight of thirteen tracks. The remaining five songs are handled by Sean C & LV (\"Freedom\" and \"Never Will It Stop\") and Self Scientific member DJ Khalil (\"There Was A Murder\", \"Footsteps\" and the first single \"Kinda Like A Big Deal\"). Guests on this album are a little odd with Keri Hilson on \"All Eyes On Me\", Yo Gotti on \"Showing Out\" and Kenna (remember, he's a Neptunes affiliate) on \"Life Change\". The biggest WTF moment, however, is when the song \"Counseling\" comes on, it uses the refrain of...wait for it...Laura Branigan's \"Self Control\"!!?? It's a great but overly commercial effort from The Clipse, something I wouldn't have expected from them.\n", "val": 0.0001391828991472721}

{"text": "Mixtapes are a good way to keep your name circulating in between albums. The Clipse dropped two very good mixtapes since their last album \"Hell Hath No Fury\". The problem with mixtapes is nothing about it is original. Its nice to hear your favorite rapper rhyming over someone else's hit. But albums are where you make you money. Nobody else to blame but yourself. Their last album was critically acclaimed but that did not reflect in record sales. They haven't had a hit single since \"Grindin\". Now, the Thorton brothers are back to prove a point with \"Til' The Casket Drops\".The Clipse are known for two things: \"coke rap\" and metaphors that would make Phife Dawg proud. The first thing you might notice is that The Neptunes are not responsible for the entire production on the album. That can be good and bad. Good because it shows the ability to step away from their comfort zone. Bad because it gets away from the sound they are known for. Veteran producers The Hitmen lend a hand on the lead off single \"Freedom\". \"Kinda Like A Big Deal\" is classic Clipse flow over a Neptunes beat featuring a weak 16 from Kanye West. \"Popular Demand (Popeyes)\" is what you would expect from a song featuring Cam'Ron. It makes no sense but the beat and hook is hot. \"I'm Good\" Ft. Pharrell is obviously a song for the club. But its catchy and grows on you.  Other standouts include the reggae-themed \"There Was A Murder\", \"Door Man\" & the reflective songs \"Footsteps\" & \"Life changes. This album is not without its flaws. \"All Eyes On Me\" ft. Keri Hilson is horrible. As well as \"Counseling\", \"Champion\" & \"Showing Out\" ft. Yo Gotti. What stands out is that all of the bad songs on this album are beats done by the Neptunes. (I always thought they were hit or miss). Overall this is a solid album. Not one of the best of the year but it will keep true hip hop fans pleased for now.Back in 1994, a rap group from Queensbridge named Mobb Deep were the hottest rap duo of the early 90's. With a classic second album and 2 good follow ups, they had the streets on lock with grimy tales of hood life. Now in 2009, a couple magazines had the Clipse as the \"greatest rap duo of all time\". That is a smack in the face to some of the greats like Gangstarr, Meth & Red, EPMD and Pete Rock & CL Smooth. The problem with the Clipse is they seem to have no identity. In the past they were the heads of the \"coke rap\" game. Now what are they about. Is it duffle bags, watches and sluts or do they wanna make you dance or are they street pushers.  It doesn't help when you don't get full attention from the Neptunes or your record label. Record sales have been the down fall of the Clipse career. Until they solve those problems, they will never dethrone Outkast as the greatest rap duo of all time.\n", "val": 0.014805153012275696}

{"text": "I took a few listens of Clipse's latest studio album, and them I went back and listened to their previous efforts. The progression from Hell Hath No Fury and Lord Willin is very clear, I actually prefer Til The Casket Drops as opposed to Hell Hath No Fury. There are more solid bangers from the new album, and a wider range and variety of sound as well. Sure they may be a few spots of weakness, but overall this is a very good album not a few good cuts. There is a big difference between the two, and I can listen to this whole album and not skip tracks. That is what makes me and many other buy an album.Now of course, some are getting deep into the analysis of the hooks, and every word but bear in mind that this album like life in general is a progression from Clipse's previous efforts. Obviously, it will not be the same. Sometimes, that is good.

{"text": "Once upon a time there was a brilliant new magazine on the news stands called Famous Monsters Of Filmland. It featured stories about the grand masters of monsterdom, and in the back of the magazine a mail order house (part of the publishing company responsible for \"FM\" as it became known) sold masks, records, hobby kits and other goodies related to the greats of that genre. One of the albums sold was An Evening With Boris Karloff And His Friends, produced by the man who also made the monster masks - Verne Langdon, and the man who among other things created Hollywood's world-famous Magic Castle - Milt Larsen. The script for the album was penned by none other than the man whose vast collection of photos appeared in the magazine, Forrest J Ackerman. These three incredibly talented individuals created then leased to Decca their project, featuring the greatest horror soundtracks of all from Universal Studios classic horror films, and hosted by the greatest, most famous monster of them all, Boris \"Frankenstein's Monster\" Karloff himself. But that is not what you're being offered here, not so far as the later Decca version is concerned. \"THE ORIGINAL\" An Evening With Boris Karloff And His Friends\" is indeed this, the never-before-heard ORIGINAL, the prototype, the \"demo\" of the album as it were, B.D. (before Decca). In this ORIGINAL version you will hear Boris Karloff's original timing and pauses, and breathiness later removed by sound editors, and you will hear an appropriately-eerie score for the entire album never before heard, composed and performed on a massive 4-manual, 34-ranks-of-pipes theatre organ (once briefly owned by Universal studios) by the man who thought up the idea in the first place, Verne Langdon. This great classic PRE-classic ORIGINAL album comes directly from the publishing vaults of Electric Lemon Record Company, and is precisely reproduced for all the world to hear, \"again, for the very first time,\" from the original 15ips master, pre-Decca. Dracula, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, The Bride Of Frankenstein, and even the groom himself ... they're all baaaaaaack! Hail, hail, the gang's all here, and you've never heard them sounding this good, ever. Boris Karloff reminisces, and his monster memories from Universal's finest fright films stir our own memories of walks home in the dark oh so many years ago after seeing these classics up there on the silver screen. Once upon a time almost never comes again, but with THE ORIGINAL \"An Evening With Boris Karloff And His Friends\", any closer would be almost too terrifying! This one belongs to you, the monster lover - be sure to include it in your collection of filmland's most famous monsters.\n", "val": 0.0017401447985321283}

{"text": "It's almost painful, how beautiful this new Laura Veirs CD is.  With six albums now, and an EP (there was another, self-released title as well, currently out of print), it has become clear to me that the woman is not capable of creating anything less than captivating ... and she keeps getting better.  JULY FLAME instantly became my favorite with the very first listen!Now, for some, Laura Veirs' flat, girlish voice will be an acquired taste.  It was for me; my initial exposure was her&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Carbon-Glacier/dp/B0002JP4J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Carbon Glacier</a>, a CD I bought based purely on reviews.  I would not have given two cents for her singing ability - at first.  But the songs crept under my skin, their organic yet chilly tones haunting me for weeks until I had to hear more.  I ended up getting all of the Veirs' recordings I could get my hands on, and each one I picked up was a keeper.The main reason, of course, given Laura's somewhat expressionless voice, is the quality of the songs, and the creativity of both her lyrics and the arrangements.  On JULY FLAME, she has stripped back some of the heavy layers and most of the electronics of her last two albums,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Year-of-Meteors/dp/B000A14OEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Year of Meteors</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Saltbreakers/dp/B000N4S8SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Saltbreakers</a>, but this doesn't mean she has abandoned complexity.  These songs are all intricate little symphonies with melodies that take unexpected turns and words that unfold like the pages of a book I can't put down.  Veirs continues to use the natural world and the cosmos as the primary sources for her imagery, but she uses them to paint lovely portraits of people, herself, and of pure emotions.  Her poetry can be challenging, using odd things like \"steer manure\" and a \"stampeding buffalo\" to describe impulses of the heart and spirit; stuff like \"iron filings\" and an \"organ pipe\" that one would not expect to find in a song lyric, and weaving it all into utterly gorgeous, dream-like stories of love, work, survival and death.  One song, about a soldier killed in battle, is drawn from Rimbaud, and sits along side the rest of Veirs' wholly original poetry quite naturally.  She lets the images do the talking, never preaching or lecturing, yet delivering potent messages just the same.The instrumentation all through JULY FLAME is constantly interesting, with Laura's fine guitar and banjo playing, Eyvind Kang's viola, Steve Moore's keyboards, and Karl Blau's harmony vocals providing most of the base.  Other instruments like saxophones, vibes, a thumb piano, clarinet, keyboards, upright bass, percussion, even a string quartet, are added here and there, but the overall sound is uncluttered and clean.  This set is so excellent throughout, that it's hard to pick the best songs, but the standouts for me are \"Sun is King,\"  \"I Can See Your Tracks,\"  \"Life Is Good Blues,\" \"Silo Song,\" \"Little Deschutes,\" \"Summer Is The Champion,\" and the aptly titled closer, \"Make Something Good.\"  Yes, she did \"make something good\" -- all of these songs have something to say, something to give.  In addition, Ms. Veirs' singing is better than ever; in fact, I don't think anyone, even with a better singing voice, would be able to improve upon these performances.  There's a perfect meld of vocal, lyric writing and music here.  Already, I can hardly wait for the next Laura Veirs project!\n", "val": 0.00010882985952775925}

It is an album indeed that you grow to love a bit more every listen particularly as you notice its small nuances, the introduction of a violin here or a viola there, a harp in the background and small pieces of orchestration.Laura Veirs is hardly a household name and yet this is actually her seventh album since her debut in 1999. It is also the first since the excellent Saltbreakers in 2007. In that time she has recorded with the Decemberists and clearly has friends in high places as Jim James of My Morning Jacket fame appears in a cameo role singing on \"I can see your tracks\" the excellent opener to July Flame and on other parts of the album.What then separates Veirs from the numerous angst ridden American folk singers on offer? Well for a start she is not angst ridden. The quality of some of the songs on July Flame have an incredibly light feel and on times this album almost floats so gently in parts you feel it could break. Listen to the last track \"Make something good\" and the gentle piano and strings and imagine yourself looking up in bright blue sky (as opposed to sinking in 10 foot snow drifts). It is dreamy and slow and pitched perfect. In the same vein \"Where are you driving\" could be on Sufjan Stevens magnificent \"Seven Swans\".The title track in particular is wonderful and surprisingly sexy. It is the nearest thing on here to an \"electric\" track building on a taught guitar lines it ends with a \"rousing\" chorus and drums. It is going to be on repeat for months. Similarly the almost classical \"Little Deschutes,\" sees Veirs piano meander over a slow burning song which wonders, \"Why care about yesterday's haze / when the stars above are all ablaze?\" Truly gorgeous stuff. The album is resolutely a summer album and on tracks like \"Summer is the champion\" and \"Wide eyed legless\" you can almost hear the insects in the background. \"Sun King\" is a nice warm alt country track and all this leads one reviewer to conclude that this is the perfect antidote to those winter blues. Indeed in \"Carol Kaye\" the song tips a wink to fellow Bella Union label members the Fleet Foxes albeit in a much understated way. Mention in dispatches should also go to Sleeper in the Valley with its soft orchestration and the very straightforward love song \"When you give your heart\" on which Veirs actually sounds a bit like Dido! \"July Flame\" is an album which transports you into summer pastures. True its far less quirky and original that say Joanna Newsom's \"Vs\" but it makes up for that in accessibility and warmth. It is one of those albums that you will probably play to death to counter the winter chill, but it is also an album that you will be still be listening to in five or ten years times which is the mark of true worth. An album of considerable charm.\n", "val": 0.02724706567823887}
{"text": "I'll preface this interview by saying this was the first Laura Veirs' CD I purchased, so it was my first impression of her. Now that I own all her music, I can understand why so many think it's a bit of a departure for her.However, this is truly one of my favorite CDs of all time. I've been listening to it steady since last summer and I just can't get over how amazing it is. Every time I listen, something new pops out at me- a certain change in the music, the way her voice lilts, a beautiful phrasing of words... I just haven't felt this way about music in a VERY long time and I'm so grateful for the experience.I know that sounds dramatic, but I'm being honest. I've always liked pop/folk acoustic-based music (lately it's a ton of Neko Case, Tegan and Sara, Innocence Mission, and I've always been a big fan of Gillian Welch...) and there's just something about this collection of songs that is absolutely perfect to me. It's rare that I'll listen to an album and live EVERY song on it, and then have songs take turns being serious favorites of mine. And that's what happens- every week something new pops out, something resonates, and I go back to not being able to get enough of this collection of songs, from start to finish.I think, if anything, this album is a little more dreamy and even \"pretty\" for Veirs- it sort of lacks a bit of the edge her earlier work has. It's more bittersweet, in a way. But fans should find something great here. And newcomers, too.I just can't recommend this CD enough.\n", "val": 0.019826127216219902}
{"text": "Summer may be the theme here, but something about \"July Flame\" suggests the chill of autumn as well, a time of turning and change. Laura Veirs clearly knows her way around folk rock, she strips down her sound on many tracks, focusing on theme and voice. There is just a bit of uneveness throughout, sort of a patchwork quilt of ideas hemmed in by nature, love, discovery, and what themes one reads into these songs.For me, the best moments here are the rockers, Summer's Champion and July Flame, songs that I cannot get enough of right now, but I suspect the slower numbers will prove worth the while too the more I listen. And I've been listening a lot lately.\n", "val": 0.00442867074161768}

{"text": "The timbre and register of the voice is a little girl's, in folk-pop mode, recalling white girl groups from the early 60s.  But the voice is sure of itself and steady, even when it floats, drifts, or even seems to waft in the shaky breeze.  Settings are mainly spare presentations of high pop using folk instruments and arrangements.  Finely finger-picked guitars feature throughout.  Somehow, the spare lines glow fat with a warm resonance.  Details vary across tracks, but songs seem to run together.  A sunny temper and sunny textures bring Smiles-era Beach Boys to mind repeatedly.  Standout:  tr 2--July flame.  A steady drum pulse, sing-song voice, and a contrapuntal structure play well off one another.  [44:03]\n", "val": 0.009964552707970142}

{"text": "July Flame is a fantastic new release from 37-tear old Laura Veirs, who is new to me - but she's not new. This album is her 6th release in 11 years, and captures a sound that falls smack between Neko Case and Sinaed O'Connor. Similar to Case's Middle Cyclone, songs here are thoughtful, at time surprising, and complex in that they evolve with each listen. It's folk, it's mellow rock, but there is a progressive/contemporary handling of the production that creates a slightly edgy ambiance. I love this CD!

Hardly anybody would expect a radio friendly pop star such as Perry to go ahead and release and album of her hits acoustically, in the classic Mtv Unplugged format.

Particularly the latter, which turns the bragging party anthem into something of a darker, worrisome take on Katy's uncertainties with her sexuality. Whether this was deliberate or not is purely in the mind of the listener, and Perry obviously is content with just sitting back and letting her fans sort out the pieces.Regardless, this album stands as a testament to a young artist's talent and well-deserved place in the American pop music lexicon.

{"text": "There's some decent live singing here but also some just average to somewhat bad vocals. Katy Perry is not known for having powerful vocals and this demonstrates that she clearly does not but thankfully she doesn't try to hit the notes she just can't hit so what you get is a more relaxed tone which is soothing but maybe a little too soothing as it can get a little dull. The lyrics also suffer quite considerably...without all the bells and whistles your attention is drawn to the occasionally poorly written lyrics particularly in I Kissed a Girl. While Brick by Brick is a pretty song it's so slow and just, again, dull.Sadly the best performance is definitely Hackensack [a cover song] so the lyrics don't suffer. While still offering some dull moments \"Lost\" is one of the better songs performed...\"Waking Up in Vegas\" is okay, with that main problem again being the attention to the lyrics which fall apart during a live acoustic performance such as this. The main thing here is the band, not the vocals, as they provide great instrumentals. It's sad to see they don't have the powerful vocalist they need in front of them to make this really shine.\n", "val": 6.817169924033806e-05}

{"text": "I am so amazed by how much depth and range Katheryn has. I cried when I heard thinking of you the first time, it made me think of my papa who is a world war 2 veteran and my nana waiting for him. Hackensack makes me feel like I am in a small town thinking of the one that got away in her musical success as a world renown musician. Lost is also amazing we have all had those times of down and out rock bottom hugging the toilet.I am blown away by how amazing Katheryn's voice is and how talented she is. She could easily be a rock/jass/country western musician. I like her accent I did not notice it but it makes me like her even more.The DVD was radical she also looked gorgeous and so cute and feminine in the way she dressed and made herself pose during the songs. I also was lost in her eyes when she sang thinking of you. I am jealous of whoever she is thinking of, and wish it was me hehe. I swear I am not a creeper/stalker I just am crushing / puppy love.Yeah there was a point where I was madly in love with her, but I told myself no this is insane she will never see me. Crazy thing is I was at a party for my friend's birthday, and Kathy was playing Toronto much music that night, I saw it on tv. I was afraid to watch because I didn't want to dishonor her with my mind (long story). When she looked at the camera as she had her back to the crowd I was thinking how I am sorry I like her but I better change the channel before I think anything rude. At the party that night, I seen a girl who looked exactly like her, and I was like /SWOOOOOOOON, I felt this feeling at the bottom of my heart, like a vibration that was like butterflies tickling my heart, and I was like no Aaron this is not Katy Perry you're insane. I kept looking I was like man go talk to her, dude I don't know don't bother your crazy this cant be possible. I then started to think how did my friend pull strings to even get this to happen, impossible. Why would she come to that party? Anyway it was Katy Hudson I was wanting to talk to, and I was like I better leave I'm losing my mind I'm such a wierdo. If I missed out there, that was the biggest mistake of my life.....Anyway the DVD was awesome and its up there with Nirvana for the unplugged music/video. I like her more than Nirvana but its her and them for best unplugged CD/Video of all time. She had a cute interview after, and I also am clean clean clean.She is definitely a girl for sure, I like feminine women. She is pure 80s however the way she goes to the maximum limit she can possibly take things. I hope she makes more music like this where she gets to play guitar and maybe a Radiohead cover because I know she likes them. I bet I could do a duet with her either Creep/Paranoid Android/Let Down/Airbag/No Surprises/The Tourist/Lucky/Nice Dream/Street Spirit. I hope Kathy takes it to the level where she gets to do what she wants and goes into more artistic music that she wants to play. Although she is a pop goddess.Enough I could type all day and I might crash the amazon site if I said as much as I think.Everyone must listen to this, I think my mom likes it, my Nana and Papa would love it too.Her voice is the best in the entire music industry.\n", "val": 0.003735048696398735}

{"text": "Though I have listened to and enjoyed some of the popular songs Ms. Perry currently has on the airwaves I wouldn't have considered purchasing an entire album as the genre is not something I listen to on a regular basis. I purchased the \"Teenage Dream\" album from Amazon as a gift for my daughter and saw the overview and samples of the MTV Unplugged CD/DVD set at the same time.  My daughter suggested I order it as she had seen part of the DVD elsewhere and thought it was very good.  She said she thought I would be surprised and pleased. I own a few MTV Unplugged DVDs of other artists and liked the forum and quality so I went ahead and made the purchase of \"Katy Perry: MTV Unplugged\". My daughter was right; I was amazed, surprised, and in awe of Ms. Perry's vocal/musical ability and now view her as a very versatile artist and probably one of the greatest women artists of the 21st century.  The first time I watched the DVD I remember asking my daughter several times if she was sure this was the same Katy Perry as on her \"Teenage Dream\" CD. Amidst a few chuckles my daughter nodded affirmatively. I now listen to more Katy Perry music with appreciation as I realize that she is an extremely capable, talented and endearing musical artist. I would sure like to hear some more acoustic tunes from Ms. Perry in the future. The inclusion of the CD of the MTV album along with the DVD has been terrific as my stereo setup has much better sound quality than my TV and makes listening to Ms. Perry that much more enjoyable. Recently, I also purchased Perry's \"One of the Boys\" CD and a very difficult to find CD of the once shelved album \"The Matrix: featuring Katy Perry\",both through Amazon.com I'm sure my daughter(and myself)will enjoy them.

Really do you need me to tell you how hot or in the news Katy is with that super sexy Rolling Stone shoot or her impending Wedding to Russell Brand? Of course not. Back to the product. On the negative side both CD & DVD contain only 7 songs, though they kinda pull a fast one on the DVD by counting Katy's few second intro on each song as an an extra track . Voila you now have 14 tracks. Included on the DVD is an interview. I know it wasn't meant this way but the interview had me totally breaking up. Get this, you have roughly an 8 minute interview thrown in. Well upon reflection lets not call it an interview. it's more like a public speaking aid where someone hands you a microphone & you talk about whatever comes into your head to get over your shyness. There are no questions, just Katy talking with breaks every where a question was likely asked but we were not supposed to hear. Figure that one out. I never pay much attention to clothing but the long dress Katy had on & that combo clamshell/jellyfish she wore in her hair looked a little weird. That's one thing now you can really see she has improved on is image awareness. No way she dresses like that now. In conclusion the Katy Perry MTV unplugged combo CD/DVD is well worth the money though proper nomenclature might be mini CD/DVD combo.\n", "val": 0.00013944064266979694}

{"text": "Earlier reviews point out highlights and other valid praise. One person objects to poor recording in some selections but may not realize these are historical treasures. Three of the four piano concertos played by Horowitz, Rachmaninoff, and a master Russian pianist are a bonus worth listening through the problems. However, notice that the two piano sonatas are split into absurdly short bites to round out the track list to a hundred. More than twenty tracks are devoted to these two selections. Other collections in this series are much longer than this one. You still receive good measure, but that many tracks for two sonatas is deceptive.(Upon further research and comparison I find that the original Santiago Rodriguez cd issue of the sonatas is divided exatly the same way in the Rachmaninoff Edition. When the cd format is played I find no discernable gap when there should be none. However, the mp3 tracks may exhibit such \"empty\" spaces. This may vary with medium and equipment. Played as downloaded on my computer, or copied to dvd and played back I find the mp3 version handy, but with silent gaps where there should be none.)\n", "val": 0.0004447674727998674}
{"text": "There certainly are some frustrations with this set of music. It merits five stars based on the music and the extreme bargain price of two dollars at the time of this writing. But I docked a star for the sheer pain in the neck posed by trying to figure out what exactly is in this set, given a lot of sloppiness in the artist credits.First off, throw out the artist credits for all three of the piano concertos -- they are all at least partly wrong. The set starts out with Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 3, credited to \"Albert Coates, Leopold Stokowski, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Vladimir Horowitz\". This is actually the debut 1930 recording of this concerto with Coates conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and Horowitz as soloist.Concerto No. 2 is credited to \"Albert Coates, Leopold Stokowski, Vladimir Horowitz\", but it is actually the 1929 recording with Leopold Stokowski conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra and Rachmaninov (not Horowitz) as soloist. (Thanks to Neil Brennan, as always, for pointing out that this is in fact the 1929 electric recording, rather than the 1924 acoustic recording as I had originally mentioned.)Both these extremely old recordings capture fine performances, especially the Horowitz 1930. I did not have either of these recordings previously and am amazed at how well they have been cleaned up. Still, these are recordings from the dawn of the classical recording era and so they are very far indeed from modern sound quality. Some people find no joy in listening to old recordings like this due to the sound. I not one of those people, but if you are, you definitely won't care for these tracks.Piano Concerto No. 1 is a real gem -- a live concert recording from 1969 by the great Sviatoslav Richter on piano playing with the USSR State Symphony Orchestra under conductor Oleg Agarkov. It is incorrectly credited to \"Aleg Agarkov, Kiril Kondrashin, Sviatoslav Richter\". The sound on this one is very good, but it is still a 1960s Soviet live recording. There is some crowd and other noise, but the performance shines through -- really outstanding job by Richter.There is a final problem with the credits on tracks 85-98, which are all ascribed to \"Alexander Ghindin, Michael Ponti, Robert Groslot\" -- ridiculous since these are all works for solo piano. For what it's worth, these selections appear to exactly reflect the contents of Disc 5 of Brilliant's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rachmaninoff-Complete-Piano-Works/dp/B003XKDEV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rachmaninoff: Complete Piano Works</a>. I cannot completely confirm who performs what, but a little digging has led me to these strong suspicions: 1) Alexander Ghindin on \"Moments Musicaux\", 2) \"Morceaux de Salon\" appear to be from Micheal Ponti (from his&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/set-of-the-complete-works-of-Rachmaninov-on-the-VOX-label/dp/B00581CN3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">set of the complete works of Rachmaninov on the VOX label</a>), and 3) the Franz Behr transcription \"Polka de W.R.\" by Robert Groslot.But there is still a lot more. The Opus 33 and 39 \"Etudes-Tableux\" are here -- except for No. 1 from the Op. 39 set (a silly omission, I have no idea why). They are ably performed by Russian pianist Nikolai Lugansky, a professor at the Moscow conservatory and a serious interpreter of Rachmaninov.Finally, the real gem of the set is the very broad selection of solo piano works performed by the Cuban-American pianist Santiago Rodriguez -- who has earned a very deserved reputation an outstanding Rachmaninov interpreter. These are first-rate performances, world class. I'm amazed that a very good portion of Rachmaninov's meatiest work for solo piano is showcased here in Mr. Rodriguez's performances:- Both Piano Sonatas- The complete Op. 23 and 32 Preludes- All three early nocturnes (Rodriguez has caught some flack for adding and end to the unfinished final nocturne, though)- Song without words- Morceaux de Fantasie, Op. 3- A couple of selections from Variations on a Theme of Corelli (which has 20 sections in all)Bitrates are variable and range from a somewhat low 146 kbps on average (surprisingly, on the Richter concerto, which sounded OK to me) to a very respectable 254 kbps on average. Total download size is 617 MB for over six and a half hours of very good Rachmaninov.The Rodriguez performances alone are a fantastic draw and are worth far more than the total cost of the set.

{"text": "I knew before sitting down in the theater today that this movie is getting nothing but trashed all over the place by critics, but I always go in with an open mind and usually end up disagreeing with them. Well, that's not the case here. First off, the movie is only 72 minutes long if you take away the end credits. They spent no time developing any of the characters, so I never really cared about any of them. Maybe a director's cut will be released on DVD, because this movie really needed another 30 minutes.Josh Brolin is a fine actor and he is the best thing about the movie, but even he seems a little bored with the whole thing at times. He does get some good one-liners along the way. John Malkovich is just here for a paycheck. Talk about a villain that will put you to sleep. His whole evil plan has been done a million times before. We all know Megan Fox looks great, but can she act? The answer is still no. She's not too bad here, especially when compared with her previous work, but her character is really unnecessary. It also seemed like they enhanced her face with some CGI touch up in certain scenes, as if to make her best asset even more flawless.The CGI is okay, the music is way too in your face, and the story leaves a lot to be desired, but Jonah Hex doesn't fall into the abysmal territory of The Wild Wild West. It at least has some relatively fun sequences. It's just too silly, even though it takes itself way too seriously. Does that make sense? Probably about as much sense as strapping two gatling guns to the sides of your horse, only to never see them again after they worked so well in the opening shootout. I guess the horse tired of lugging them around. Oh, and how stupid were those dynamite crossbows?\n", "val": 6.667988054687157e-05}
{"text": "As much as I hate sounding like a cinematic apologist, I can't deny it when I enjoy a film in spite of almost universal disdain. Having given passing grades to critically lambasted films like \"10,000 B.C.,\" \"The Women,\" \"Nine,\" and most recently, \"Legion,\" I will once again raise my voice in defense of \"Jonah Hex,\" a loud, aggressive, lightning-quick revenge tale that seems to have no qualms about its delightfully preposterous premise or its gloriously fantastical vision of nineteenth-century America. It was made, I believe, not only in the spirit of fun as an escapist action spectacle, but also as a statement - weak though it may be - about terrorism and modern nuclear war. Have better films been made with these qualities? You bet. Still, this movie achieved everything it wanted to achieve, and with all due respect to those who wrote scathing reviews, sometimes you can't ask for any more than that.Adapted from the comic book by John Albano and Tony Dezuniga, the film tells the story of the title character (Josh Brolin), who in the 1860s served the Confederate Army before disobeying a direct order and being forced to kill one of his fellow soldiers. That soldier's father, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), retaliated by killing Hex's family and branding the right side of his face, turning it into a gaping mass of scar tissue. Although never adequately explained, it seems Hex gained supernatural powers from his near death experience, namely the ability to raise the dead with a touch of his hand. This will come in handy on more than one occasion; it's especially fun, in its own ghoulish way, when he has to dig up the grave of Turnbull's son to extract information.But I'm getting ahead of the story. Believing Turnbull dead, Hex has spent the last number of years as a lawless bounty hunter, driven by profit instead of loyalty, sought after only as a last resort. And that's exactly where the American government is at; President Ulysses S. Grant (Aiden Quinn) has learned that Turnbull is still alive, plotting to destroy Washington D.C. on July 4, 1876, America's centennial. Grant and his staff know that only Hex can stop him. Hex accepts their offer, not out of patriotism but because he and Turnbull have unfinished business. In many ways, the two are exactly the same: Both have lost loved ones; both are driven by revenge; both hate the American government. So what exactly would Hex get out of this if he were to succeed? He's certainly not looking to be a national icon.Tagging along is Hex's love interest, a prostitute named Lilah (Megan Fox), who isn't given all that much to do except look hot, fight men twice her size, deliver smart-aleck one-liners, and pack weapons in all sorts of naughty places. It's hard to find another angle of approach here; apart from the obvious visual appeal, I suspect nothing of value would have been lost if this character had been eliminated from the screenplay. Honestly, she's about as necessary to the plot as the appendix is to the human digestive system. Of course, we don't begrudge the appendix just because it happens to be useless. So why should we begrudge this character? How can we given the fact that the plot is equally useless?The film runs at a brisk eighty minutes, and that includes the end credits. What I find amazing is that, with such a short running time, director Jimmy Hayward still managed to tell a cohesive and fairly complete story, which makes me second-guess my belief that being thorough doesn't necessarily mean being exhaustive; I learned pretty much everything I needed to know about the plot, the settings, and the characters, the only exception to the latter being Lilah. Perhaps this is because nothing about the story is based in reality - not even the Civil War, which had only passing references to begin with, seems genuinely depicted. Or perhaps it's because there wasn't much to expand on, the characters being little more than stick-figure caricatures. Whatever the case, its length had no real impact on its quality, and that's really saying something.I guess what I'm saying is that I enjoyed this film specifically for its silliness, its tongue-in-cheek attitude to the material, its comic book mindlessness. I also enjoyed the allusions to past and present political situations, specifically as related to the development and usage of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Granted, the allusions are momentary at best; what you're really supposed to focus on is the fun. \"Jonah Hex\" will never be considered a great film. It won't even be considered a good film. In all likelihood, it will be forgotten ten years down the line. Nevertheless, I do think it can be enjoyed as the violent flight-of-fancy it was so clearly intended to be. If there ever was a movie made purely for your entertainment, this would be it.\n", "val": 0.005751538090407848}

{"text": "First, I want to mention some of the good stuff. Josh Brolin is excellent as Hex, perfect casting, great job by Brolin, thoroughly enjoyable to watch. John Malkovich was very good in a role that could have easily been too over the top to be taken seriously. Fassbender was genuinely creepy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan was great, and Megan Fox looks gorgeous and her acting is not that bad. Combine that with an amazing soundtrack by Mastodon, (and a surprise cameo by Brent Hinds) I have to say I enjoyed the movie. The negatives: \"The Weapon\" - a weird, quasi-science, completely unexplained \"nation-killer\" invented by Eli Whitney... WTF? Stupid. While on the subject, why does the world have to be at stake? A simple revenge tale would have sufficed. Aidan Quinn was awful, but it probably wasn't his fault, unless he wrote his own lines. Why tell Hex's backstory with a couple of minutes of poorly animated crap with a voice-over when they could've filmed Hex's origin sequence and made it a much better movie? No idea, but I can't explain many of the choices that were made on this movie. Why was it only 80 minutes long? Who thought that was a good idea? Who cast Will Arnett in a straight role? I kept waiting for him to do something funny. To sum it up, there was some really good work done on this movie, but there were too many terrible decisions made that left it a disjointed mess in spite of its potential. As a life-long Jonah Hex fan, I was happy to see him captured so perfectly by Brolin, but disappointed as hell that the studio screwed up the movie so badly, and ruined any chance of this becoming a successful franchise.6/10Video Quality: 3.5/5Audio Quality: 4/5\n", "val": 7.154450577218086e-05}

{"text": "I must confess I never was into comic books as a kid & don't know much about the legend & lore that surrounds comic book hero's.  I do however enjoy the whole comic book turned into movies genre that has developed.  So I am not burdened by any preconceived expectations or put off by anything \" Hollywood\" may have messed up with this character...I am simply rating a action movie.  I found it enjoyable Jonah Hex only has one \" Super Power\" & that is to talk to the dead which isn't even a power that aids him in combat.  That makes him have to rely on his very human skills as a gunfighter & his wit.  I like these type of \" Super Hero's\" because it doesn't take extremely powerful villains to be a threat to them or their cause.  Unlike Superman who was written so powerful they had to create \" Kryptonite\" & a super genius villain along with either villains from Superman's home planet or villains with almost godlike powers to even make the conflict interesting.  Then they gave Superman the ability to go back in time & fix any mistakes or failures...thus making Superman somewhat boring.  I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for pointing all that out  L.O.L. !!!  But it sounds like there is a lot of hate for this movie already, which I feel is a bit unfair.

This movie I like its creative side and new ideas about Jonah Hex but was not as good as I expected, hoped nor wanted to be.\n", "val": 1.7080526959034614e-05}

{"text": "This movie has been around for a while now and I have waited because I heard some negative reviews of the movie. So I got bored one night and finally bit the bullet and rented the movie. I like Josh Brolin as an actor and Megan Fox couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, but we all know why she is in the movie. In fact as I write this review they have the title of the movie and her name under it and not Josh Brolin's. That makes no sense at all, but I digress.Needless to say I had no expectations of this movie, or at least no high expectations. So when I found myself thoroughly engrossed in the storyline and feeling sorry for Hex's character I had to admit that there was something redeeming about this movie. Many people will disagree with my review and probably even mock me, but I enjoyed the unique character or superhero or anti-hero that is Jonah Hex. The storyline was interesting, and being set in a post civil war historical time period was done pretty well.Is this movie a blockbuster that will change the face of cinema as we know it.... no. Is this movie entertaining and fun to watch... yes. I give it 4 stars, with losing a star due to Megan Fox having no acting skills. If the criteria for her character was to be a hot looking woman then there are plenty of woman who could have played this role, can act, would have done the role for less money, and made the character more likable. That is why this movie lost a star. I don't hate Megan Fox on any personal level, I simply don't think she is an actress. That's my 2 1/2 cents on this movie.\n", "val": 0.0049809981137514114}

{"text": "If you're looking for a movie that has a connection to the comics this character is based off of, then forget about this movie.Jonah Hex cannot bring people back from the dead.  In the comic he's just a really good gunslinger and a top notch bounty hunter.  He didn't need super powers in the comics to be interesting, but apparently Hollywood can't resist screwing up a character because they have to sell tickets and make money.I'd also like to state that the only one who delivers a good performance in this movie is John Malkovich.  Megan Fox is just there to be eye candy for teenage boys and fans of the Transformers movies.  And Josh Brolin is easily forgettable in his role as Jonah because he does such a poor job acting.If you're a fan of the comics, don't watch this.  If you want a good western or action movie, don't watch it, it's just boring and the special effects suck.\n", "val": 2.3257378416019492e-05}

Still, I felt compelled to review this one and point out that I would recommend it on the basis that is it what it is - an overblown, watered down Hollywood adapation of an otherwise excellent graphic novel. But, you have some time to kill, and you are just looking for some brain candy, and are also a fan of Josh Brolin, you coul;d definitely do worse. It's really kind of a fun Sunday afternoon movie to rent if you aren't looking for anything spectacular and don't mind forking over a few bucks for a couple hours of decent entertainment.
