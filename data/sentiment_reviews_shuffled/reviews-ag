{"text": "The musicianship is outstanding, however...the recording was a mere 28 minutes, and 6 seconds. A bit stingy, I thought. The recording is divided into three movements and I am just warming to the bluegrass motets when it ceases. The only complaint I have is the recording is too short for the CD venue, I have heard the Kruger Brothers in concert and anticipated something a little more developed and in depth. Oh well.\n", "val": 0.0019873001147061586}

{"text": "There was nothing wrong with the seller, but I expected this to be the wonderful actual soundtrack you hear during the movie - which is what most \"move soundtracks\" consist of!  But not this!!  It is the artist singing his songs he wrote for the movie and DON'T SOUND ANYTHING like the actual tracks in the movie.  I was SO disappointed.  I won't send it back because it is opened, but I would not recomend buying this for anyone who might think they will get the ACTUAL movie soundtrack you hear during the movie!\n", "val": 0.0001766216882970184}
{"text": "During times like this, in which we've seen so many sheep just follow and follow, buying rap cd's just because of the person's name that's on it...It's absolutely refreshing to see that among all the BS that's coming out these days, the man who originated Mafioso rap, has come back to show the immitators how it's meant to be.I'm not gonna lie, after hearing \"Immobilarity\" and \"Lex Diamond Story\", I honestly thought we had lost Raekwon, since those two albums were below average.But here's Cuban Link II, and it is by far the best Hip Hop album I've heard since 2001.Thank God for Raekwon, and Thank God that he released this album on the same day as the ones who have been immitating his style all these years. Because \"Rap was BORING, N**az ANOTHER idol!\"Track for track, it is nothing short of amazing, and an instant classic!Welcome back from the coma, Hip Hop! Welcome back to life!\n", "val": 0.06102579087018967}
