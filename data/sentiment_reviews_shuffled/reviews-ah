{"text": "One can overuse the word \"masterpiece\" when describing an excellent album, so I won't say that. What I will say is that this is the album fans of Matraca Berg have thought was inside her, big, funny, poignant with an unmistakable snarl that no one does quite like Matraca.I've listened to this album about 20 times now. The lines are now jumping out at me, like \"Mom said call the preacher, I just called the law\" and \"lazy river, not a lick of ambition, just goes to Kentucky and comes back home again\" from my very favorite song, \"Oh Cumberland\". Matraca has plenty of help from cowriters including novelist Jill McCorkle on the soon to be standard, \"Your Husband's Cheating On Us.\" But the imprint of these songs is all hers.Of the album's 11 songs, only \"Clouds\" is just ok. The other 10 are pretty wonderful, from \"You and Tequila\" (CMA song of the year nominee) to \"Dreaming Fields\" to \"Silver and Glass\" to an atypical choice of subject in \"A Cold Rainy Morning in London in June\" which Matraca still pulls off very effectively. I love the opening guitar tones which introduce \"If I Had Wings\" which let the listener know they are not in for easy breezy songs on this album. This is not Bruce Springsteen's \"Nebraska\", not quite that heavy but the album could be subtitled Tennessee as so many of the songs seem so rooted in time and place here.I've been a fan of Matraca for several years but I think this album is her high water mark. Well done, deserving of recognition and success, hope to see her soon in the Boston area.\n", "val": 0.029667720198631287}

{"text": "I had heard of Kendrick in some feeds that I keep up with, but I never really checked him out. When I heard him on \"The City\" on \"The R.E.D. Album\", I was sold. I bought it almost immediately. I can't lie, at first I was a little disappointed; I was expecting (or at least hoped) that every track would have the emotion that he put into the recording of \"The City\". I still liked it, but some songs just lacked that raw emotion I wanted to hear. With that being said, come the second listen, I got over it. There's some tracks that do what I was looking for, but I really enjoy the others. They have a \"cool/laid-back\" feel to them, which makes the album good for ambient music and of course there are more lyric-heavy tracks too and they don't disappoint. BUY THIS ALBUM! You won't be disappointed; besides, it's only $4.\n", "val": 0.0028612345922738314}
