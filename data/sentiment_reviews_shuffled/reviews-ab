{"text": "Now, over the years, it has been debated what is the best Maiden album. While most people might pick \"Number of the Beast\", \"Powerslave,\" or \"Virtual IX\", I pick \"Somewhere in Time\" as my personal favorite. While I enjoy \"Powerslave\" and \"Brave New World\" immensely, this particular review states that \"Somewhere...\" is the ultimate Maiden.Reasons being is that a few of these songs happen to be my all-time favorites of all time.\"Caught Somewhere in Time\" is a great song and this pulls out lots of electronic goodies.  Bruce Dickinson is great!\"Deja Vu\" is one of the hardcore guitar songs. Although featuring few vocals, this song goes ALL-OUT on the guitars. I especially liked the fast-paced guitar work and you can tell that Adrian Smith enjoyed this one to the fullest.\"Alexander the Great\" is an awesome song, if a bit overlong (especially the tiring 3-minute instrumental somewhere in the middle). My favorite part is the opening \"march\" after Alexander's father says his death words. Also, this is one of the historical rock songs, and it deserves high points.\"Strangers in a Strange Land\" has a darker feel than the rest of the songs, and it has a couple synthesized goodies here and there.And... quite possibly my all-time favorite song is \"Wasted Years.\" This is classic Maiden! A great song that is just perfect; it's not overlong and the instrumentals inbetween the lyrics are not overbearing or dull (like some other Maiden songs over the years). I love the chorus especially.The neat thing about this album is that (like Nicko McBrain with the \"Piece of Mind\" album) Adrian Smith is the real highlight of this album. The songs he wrote on this are nothing lower than awesome. Here it is guys... an absolute MUST HAVE for any Maiden fan.\n", "val": 0.05529504641890526}

{"text": "Like many other fans, I was at first baffled by HelloGoodbye.  I didn't know whether to embrace this wacky band, or if I was too intimidated by their fun style to become a dedicated listener.  After a couple weeks of listening, I decided I had fallen in love with HelloGoodbye.  I love to listen to their music and just dance around.  It's infectious and always makes for a good time.  Seeing them live is just the same.  I got this demo as soon as it came out and now I have preordered the full-length: \"Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs!\" from westaspenmerch.com.  I can't wait until it comes.\n", "val": 0.02548537403345108}
