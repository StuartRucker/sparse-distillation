{"text": "Okay, we all heard how ground breaking and important this album was.  We all liked to hear \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" when it came over the radio back in 91 and 92.  Since then, people (including musicians) can't stop talkin about this freakin album.  I don't know, but it may be possible that people automatically think of Cobain as a legend just due to the fact he killed himself.  In all reality, this is just a normal rock album.  Let's not over do it, people!\n", "val": 0.020083490759134293}
