{"text": "This music is awesome to listen to when studying or just when you don't want a lot of noise. The organs are prolific and harmonious, the singers are melodic and strong, and there is enough songs that you don't here the same song over and over again. One of the songs even has an organ solo! If you like traditional organ based worship music this is a great addition to your collection. The price isn't bad either.\n", "val": 0.03263652324676514}
{"text": "This purchase is worth it alone for the St. Stephen>NFA>Stella Blue>St. Stephen sandwich in the 2nd set. Pure improvisational genius. If you love the Dead you will love this show, plain and simple. It's a no-brainer purchase. Also a fantastic Scarlet>Fire to boot, shades of 5/8/77 in the transition. Just amazing.\n", "val": 0.05760963633656502}
{"text": "I had respected him for a long time for his multi-instrumental abilities and his knack for intimate yet still universal song-writing, but his music was missing something for me. Fans of 'Enjoy Your Rabbit' should hear a slight return to those days but combined, I feel in the perfect amount, with his states series orchestrations. I was completely pleased.\n", "val": 0.017466707155108452}

{"text": "I had previously listened to American Love and Stitches by Haste the Day, and I enjoyed both songs but I felt like something was missing from those songs which kept me from purchasing their earlier albums.However, after sampling some of the songs I ultimately purchased Attack of The Wolf King and immediately fell in love with it. The screams and clean vocals of the lead singer are very impressive. The drums and guitar work also go really well in many of the songs.I recently saw these guys live and they brought it hard. One of my new favorite bands just because of this album.I would recommend listening to: Dogs Like Vultures, Travesty, and The Place That Most Deny.\n", "val": 0.008012604899704456}

{"text": "BUY IT!!!  You won't be sorry.  I picked it up this morning as a quick impulse buy...I've listened to about half of it today, and I still haven't heard a single piece I'm unfamiliar with.  Lots of classical favorites.  It's been the perfect music for homework.  I'm relaxed but not falling asleep over my books.\n", "val": 0.01575252041220665}
