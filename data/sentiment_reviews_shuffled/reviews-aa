{"text": "Bob Dylan is the artist that some people love to hate and other people love to love.  He is arguably the most important cultural figure of the 20th century, or at least the last half of it, single-handedly changing everything about popular music from the length of songs to their subject matter to the way they are sung, yet some refuse to give him credit for any of these things or for the many great songs and albums he's created, dismissively complaining \"he can't sing!\" and leaving it at that.  There are also those who will defend him to the death after a lousy concert performance (and there have been many, especially since around 2010 or so) or an ill-conceived idea like the recent \"Sinatra\" albums or his odd behavior on his final \"The Late Show with David Letterman\" performance.  Even Dylan himself in his 2012 \"Rolling Stone\" interview lamented, \"Why is it that when people talk about me they have to go crazy?\"I try to be more rational in my discussions of Dylan and have felt the wrath of Dylan fans and haters alike on various internet forums.  As I write this, there are 458 reviews of Christmas in the Heart posted by others, and the only reason I think that mine is necessary is just to give a little different take on why I like it.I do like this album.  It has a nice old-timey feel to it.  I like the traditional arrangements and the production, the latter an area where Dylan hasn't been given enough credit since he started producing his own albums, beginning with \"Love and Theft,\" under the nom de plume Jack Frost.  Those who complain about Dylan's singing on this one miss the point.  Christmas songs are like folk songs - they're for EVERYBODY to sing, not just the sweet-voiced among us.  The Earth is 4.5 billion years old, but how old is the phonograph?  Or the radio?  How long have these things been commonplace in homes?  It's maybe only the last 80-90 years or so that we've been paying professionals to do our singing for us.  Previously, if you wanted to hear a song, you sung it yourself, or your family sat around singing it.  That's how the tradition of folk song, in which Dylan is grounded, started - and of course, families and friends gathered to sing Christmas carols as well.So if Dylan's voice isn't so great on this album (and it's not), that's OK with me, as he's just carrying on a folk tradition that says anybody can sing these songs.  If, for your tastes, he sounds too much like your great uncle after one too many egg nogs, that's fine, as there are plenty of good Christmas albums by the likes of Bing Crosby, Tony Bennett, and Peggy Lee to recommend.  I for one miss my great uncles.\n", "val": 0.0003098412125837058}

{"text": "I have been listening to this music while I study. The quality of the tracks is amazing. My favorite tracks are A Place in Heaven, Immortal, and Sonera; but there are too many to count. Each track flows well from the next one.Also, take note and compare the length of these tracks to those of competitors in the epic music genre. The problem with epic music CD's is that, being music primarily from trailers, all the tracks are like 1-2 minutes long. This one has many more long tracks, and they aren't just long to be long (cough cough Hans Zimmerman in Batman), each one has a unique flavor, a subtle development, and in many cases sweet vocals.If I heard this music in Cirque du Soleil I would probably freak out! :)For $8.99 this is the steal of the year in terms of quality music.Daniel\n", "val": 0.003883904544636607}

I really can't tell you a favorite track, because they all are great in there own way. Buy this album. You will not be disappointed. T.D. Jakes does a great job with the interludes as well. Enjoy and be blessed!\n", "val": 0.059522856026887894}
