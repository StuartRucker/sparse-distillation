{"text": "I stumbled upon this band through youtube and their video for the outstanding single \"I Wanna be Your Bro',\" which is my favorite track. And at $6, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to download their entire album from Amazon. My initial reaction was this is a band that'd easily be featured on a Quentin Tatantino soundtrack, as it's frought with fun lyrics and ridiculously catchy rockabilly based rhythms.It's got one or two skipable tracks, but as someone who's never fancied himself a particular fan of this (sub)genre, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the tracks. There's a definite eclecticism to the sounds between songs, but not jarringly so. The fuzzed out guitars and rockabilly beats are a through-line for this fun, catchy and unique album. In a musical landscape fraught w/ autotuned, disposable singles, Those Darlins have made a unique and undeniably awesome album with \"Screws Get Loose.\"\n", "val": 0.017434662207961082}

{"text": "I'm a musician. A rather good one. I joined the Musicians Union in 1960, and played jazz, R&B, contemp, country, etc, on TV, in movies, on soundtracks, live, and on tour. That means I have a lot of experience in listening, and playing LOTS of music. AND this isn't about me, but I just wanted to qualify the following review:I picked up on kd lang about the mid-eighties. I loved her then, and I love her now. She has such a strong natural dose of inherent musicial abilitiy that its sometimes just stunning. Have you noticed that her vibrato is usually REAL close to 16th beats relative to the tempo of the song she's singing? I mean, that is flat incredible. I can, and would like to sing her praises for the word-limit, but then, I would never get to the point.This album, and more the song selection and succession are just off a bubble from plumb. kd usually has real DEPTH to her lyrics, and the way she makes the listener FEEL exactly what she means by the words she sings is a huge strong point. Since blues, jazz and 'heavy genre' music first appeared, the high talents were those that made you, the listener, think that the artist was singing to YOU, in language that you understood, and that you knew the artist was singing just for you, and a select few that are on the same wave-length.I find the majority of these songs weak in their meaning. kd can usually do a la-la-la-la-la and have it touch my soul....not so on this project. This feels like it might have been a producer-mandated date-obligated release. I just don't feel the words like I usually do on a kd project. This release is good-don't misunderstand me...but it certainly isn't her best, or even in that range of releases that kd has brought to us. Compare this to 'Hymns of the 49th' and feel the different level of emotion.I'm gonna wait for her next project. I know it'll be better, and 'back in the saddle again'!\n", "val": 0.003529223147779703}
